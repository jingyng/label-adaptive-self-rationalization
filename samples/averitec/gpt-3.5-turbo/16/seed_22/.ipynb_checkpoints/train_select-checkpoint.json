Being president is a more than full-time job, and he couldn't make time to travel to Florida to cast a vote in person. So he voted absentee. \n \nQuestion 3:  How secure is mail in voting (absentee ballot voteing)? \nAnswer 3:  Numerous safeguards are included in the absentee voting process. Absentee ballots are sent only to registered voters who request them using an official N.C. Absentee Ballot Request Form before the deadline. The request must be signed and include identifying information about the voter, including date of birth and driver\u2019s license number or last four digits of the voter\u2019s Social Security number. Voters must vote their ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary, and those witnesses must sign the absentee return envelope certifying that the voter marked their ballot and is the registered voter submitting the marked ballot.\n\nOnly the voter or their near relative or legal guardian may return the ballot. Upon return, the county board of elections reviews the absentee envelope to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. Once the ballot is accepted, that voter is marked in the system as having voted in that election.\n\nData on who has requested absentee ballots is now confidential until Election Day. Criminal penalties have been increased for absentee voting fraud-related offenses. Many people are watching our absentee voting process, including candidates, political parties, county boards of elections, and political and data scientists. If there are anomalies or questionable activities, they will be identified by or reported to election officials.\n\nFinally, the State Board of Elections has an Investigations Division that investigates credible allegations of elections fraud and refers cases to prosecutors when warranted by the evidence.

The evidence provided shows that there are numerous safeguards in place for the absentee voting process, including the requirement for the voter to provide identifying information, the need for witnesses or a notary, restrictions on who can return the ballot, criminal penalties for fraud-related offenses, and systems in place to prevent someone from voting twice. Additionally, the evidence states that absentee voting fraud is taken seriously and investigated by the State Board of Elections. Therefore, the claim is false as the evidence demonstrates that there are significant measures in place to protect the integrity of the absentee voting process."}

However, it is important to note that even before Brexit, the UK was not part of the Schengen agreement and had the power to carry out border checks. Therefore, the claim that a no deal Brexit would mean no more uncontrolled immigration is false because the UK already had some control over immigration prior to Brexit."}
