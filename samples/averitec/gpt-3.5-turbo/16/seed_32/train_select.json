This indicates that while Sanders had reservations about the initial version of Obamacare, he ultimately supported it with the added proposal. So, the claim is partially true in that he had some opposition initially, but false in that he ultimately voted in favor."}

While there is evidence that sniffer dogs have been trained to detect COVID-19 in sweat samples with promising results, there is still a need for larger data sets and more research to fully evaluate the effectiveness of using sniffer dogs to detect the virus in real-world situations. So, while there is some evidence to support the claim, it is not yet conclusive."}
