The evidence provided shows that if the UK were to leave the EU with a no deal, it would no longer be obligated to follow EU rules on freedom of movement within member states, giving the UK more control over immigration. However, it is important to note that even before Brexit, the UK was not part of the Schengen agreement and had the power to carry out border checks. Therefore, the claim that a no deal Brexit would mean no more uncontrolled immigration is false because the UK already had some control over immigration prior to Brexit."}
