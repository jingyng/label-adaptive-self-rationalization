Absentee ballots are sent only to registered voters who request them using an official N.C. Absentee Ballot Request Form before the deadline. The request must be signed and include identifying information about the voter, including date of birth and driver\u2019s license number or last four digits of the voter\u2019s Social Security number. Voters must vote their ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary, and those witnesses must sign the absentee return envelope certifying that the voter marked their ballot and is the registered voter submitting the marked ballot.\n\nOnly the voter or their near relative or legal guardian may return the ballot. Upon return, the county board of elections reviews the absentee envelope to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. Once the ballot is accepted, that voter is marked in the system as having voted in that election.\n\nData on who has requested absentee ballots is now confidential until Election Day. Criminal penalties have been increased for absentee voting fraud-related offenses. Many people are watching our absentee voting process, including candidates, political parties, county boards of elections, and political and data scientists. If there are anomalies or questionable activities, they will be identified by or reported to election officials.\n\nFinally, the State Board of Elections has an Investigations Division that investigates credible allegations of elections fraud and refers cases to prosecutors when warranted by the evidence. The State Board also conducts several post-election audits which will catch inconsistencies that can then be investigated by the board or the Investigations Division.","answer_type":"Extractive","boolean_explanation":null,"cached_source_url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20230419011138\/https:\/\/www.ncsbe.gov\/voting\/vote-mail\/faq-voting-mail","source_medium":"Web text","source_url":"https:\/\/www.ncsbe.gov\/voting\/vote-mail\/faq-voting-mail#Howsecureisabsentee-by-mailvoting-795"}],"question":"How secure is mail in voting (absentee ballot voteing)?"},{"answers":[{"answer":"If someone has voted an absentee ballot and then shows up to vote in person, the check-in system will alert the poll worker that the person has already voted.
