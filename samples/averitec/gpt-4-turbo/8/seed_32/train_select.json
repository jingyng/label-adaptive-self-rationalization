According to the evidence provided, Victoria's Secret's UK branches entered into administration, which is similar to bankruptcy but allows the company to continue operations under administrator supervision. This is primarily due to the financial losses incurred and the impact of COVID-19 leading to store closures. However, the use of the term 'bankruptcy' may not be entirely accurate as the company has not filed for bankruptcy but rather went into administration in the UK. Additionally, the claim mentions bankruptcy in general terms while the evidence specifies that the changes were only in the UK and did not affect other international branches."}
