Answer 2 and Answer 5 indicate increased funding, equipment donations, and training for security forces, which suggests greater support. However, the claim that Nigeria is meeting these challenges with superior firepower and resolve is contradicted by Answer 3, which mentions inadequate equipping of soldiers against Boko Haram, indicating issues with firepower. Moreover, ongoing attacks and insecurity as detailed in Answer 6 show challenges in effectively resolving the security issues despite increased support."}
