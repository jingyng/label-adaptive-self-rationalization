But he would like to see larger data sets on how well dogs identify positive and negative samples. He also notes that there is variation in how well individual dogs perform. In Grandjean\u2019s study, for example, 2 dogs identified 68 out of 68 positive samples, whereas one missed 10 out of 57 cases. \n \nQuestion 5:  Do the studies find that using sniffer dogs to detect COVID-19 is useful? \nAnswer 5:  Groups need to boost their sample sizes before the wider scientific community can evaluate how useful the dogs might be, agrees James Logan, an infectious-disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who is training and studying COVID-19 dogs, including Storm, Maple and Asher. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to go out too early with grand claims and small data sets,\u201d he says. \n","__index_level_0__":3049}
