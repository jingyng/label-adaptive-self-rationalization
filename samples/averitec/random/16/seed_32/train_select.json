We have challenges of poor identification, late recognition and therefore, limited funding. The result of it is that a lot of people who have mental issues suffer on their own, people don\u2019t understand they are not feeling well \n \nQuestion 2:  What is the percentage of Nigerians that are suffering from some sort of mental illness ? \nAnswer 2:  With a population of 181 million, it is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the population suffers from a mental illness. This means that more than 54 million people are dealing with mental illness with little to no help. In comparison, the Center for Disease Control estimates that 54 million is the same number of people who are diagnosed with arthritis in the United States. \n\", and claim \"One in four Nigerians are suffering from some sort of mental illness.\". Please explain why the claim is Not enough information to confirm.","explanation_llama":"The claim \"One in four Nigerians are suffering from some sort of mental illness\" is not enough information to confirm because the provided evidence estimates that 30% of the population suffers from mental illness, not 25%. The claim lacks precision and accuracy.","explanation_gpt35":"The evidence provided states that an estimated 30 percent of the Nigerian population suffers from a mental illness, which translates to more than 54 million people. The claim that \"One in four Nigerians are suffering from some sort of mental illness\" is not accurate based on the evidence provided, as it indicates a higher prevalence of mental illness in Nigeria.","explanation_gpt4":"The claim \"One in four Nigerians are suffering from some sort of mental illness\" suggests that approximately 25% of the Nigerian population is affected by mental illness. However, the evidence provided states that as much as 30% of the population may suffer from mental illness. This discrepancy between the claim (25%) and the evidence (30%) means there is not enough information to confirm the exact percentage, as the evidence suggests a potentially higher rate than the claim indicates. Additionally, the evidence itself refers to an estimate, which implies a lack of precise data, further supporting the conclusion that there is not enough information to confirm the claim accurately."}

According to the Quote Investigator, the closest verified match to this quote appeared in 1974, attributed to educator Arleen Lorrance, long after Gandhi's death in 1948. The thematic essence of the quote aligns with Gandhi's philosophy, as indicated by a related quote referenced by Professor Johannes Bakker: \"If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change.\" However, the exact wording attributed to Gandhi in the claim cannot be verified based on available historical records. Thus, while the sentiment reflects Gandhi's teachings, the specific phrasing does not originate from him."}

The Wisconsin appeals court overturned the earlier ruling that would have removed these voters quickly and also ruled that the state election officials were not in contempt of court for failing to take immediate action on the purge.

However, the claim is also false because it incorrectly states that 40 million workers would receive a pay raise, when in fact the actual numbers are lower.","explanation_gpt35":"The claim is partially true because the evidence provided supports that around 39.7 million workers would benefit from raising the US federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025, not 40 million. However, the claim is false in stating that raising the minimum wage would push the wage scale up for everyone else, as the evidence does not support this assertion.","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that raising the US federally required minimum wage to $15 an hour would give 40 million workers a pay raise is partially true. According to the analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, approximately 39.7 million workers would benefit from the wage increase, which is close to the 40 million stated in the claim. However, the claim that it would \"push the wage scale up for everyone else\" is more ambiguous and potentially misleading. The Congressional Budget Office analysis suggests that the wages of around 10 million workers earning slightly above the new minimum could also rise, but this does not necessarily mean it would push the wage scale up for \"everyone else\" broadly. Therefore, the claim is true regarding the number of workers directly benefiting but less accurate regarding the broader impact on all other wage earners."}

In cases of pneumonic plague, the infected individual can spread the bacteria through respiratory droplets when coughing.
