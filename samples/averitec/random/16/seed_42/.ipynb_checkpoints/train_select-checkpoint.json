Although considerable data on COVID-19 are available, much remains to be learned about its effects on pregnant women and newborns.\n\nNo data are currently available to assess whether pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease associated with other respiratory illnesses (eg, 2009 H1N1 influenza),1 but thus far, pregnant women with COVID-19 do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease compared with the general population \n \nQuestion 3:  What do the WHO guidelines say about the risks of Covid-19 for pregnant women? \nAnswer 3:  Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are  older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased  risk of developing severe COVID-19\nDue to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) to their healthcare provider. \n \nQuestion 4:  Are pregnant women at risk of serious illness due to COVID-19? \nAnswer 4:  Pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness. To reduce severe COVID-19\u2013associated illness, pregnant women should be aware of their potential risk for severe COVID-19 illness. Prevention of COVID-19 should be emphasized for pregnant women and potential barriers to adherence to these measures need to be addressed. The overall risk of COVID-19 to pregnant women is low. However, pregnant women who have COVID-19 appear more likely to develop respiratory complications requiring intensive care than women who aren't pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pregnant women are also more likely to be placed on a ventilator. In addition, pregnant women who are Black or Hispanic appear to be disproportionately affected by infection with the COVID-19 virus.\n\nRisk factors for severe COVID-19 during pregnancy include older maternal age, a high body mass index and pre-existing diabetes or hypertension. \n \nQuestion 5:  Can COVID-19 be passed from mother to unborn child? \nAnswer 5:  We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the active virus has not been found in samples of fluid around the baby in the womb or breastmilk. \n\", and claim \"Pregnant women are not more susceptible to COVID-19.\". Please explain why the claim is Partially true and false.","explanation_llama":"The claim \"Pregnant women are not more susceptible to COVID-19\" is Partially False. The evidence shows that while there is no increased risk of severe disease compared to the general population, pregnant women who are older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes may be at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. Additionally, pregnant women may be more likely to develop respiratory complications requiring intensive care, be placed on a ventilator, and experience disproportionate effects due to their race or ethnicity."}
