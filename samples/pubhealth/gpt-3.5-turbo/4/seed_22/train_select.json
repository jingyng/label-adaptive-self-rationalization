(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) However, in this case, it is accurate. Africans in at least one Chinese city are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to COVID-19 fears. Numerous legitimate news reports describe such targeted evictions, stemming from fears of another COVID-19 outbreak, in the southern China city of Guangzhou. Home to many Africans, Guangzhou has long been one of China\u2019s main commercial and trading centers. One report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as \"\"Little Africa\"\" are being forced to remain inside their apartments \u2014 even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine \u2014 and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to Al Jazeera. President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. But China has denied racism in the effort. But the actions are widespread enough, according to the Associated Press, that African officials are confronting China over racist treatment of Africans, including Africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe said: \"\"It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents. China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\"\" The Guangdong provincial government has responded to concerns about discrimination by calling China and Africa good friends, partners and brothers, according to the BBC. More than two dozen Africans told CNN about being left without a home, being subject to random testing for COVID-19, or being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Photos and videos posted on social media showed Africans sleeping on sidewalks or waiting under shop awnings after being ordered out of their apartments and hotel rooms, the Washington Post reported. And community leaders told the BBC that hundreds of Africans had been evicted after online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among African people. A video shared on Facebook claims that \"\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold.\"\" Numerous news articles report that, amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, China has focused on foreigners as a possible source of the virus, and Africans in the southern China city of Guangzhou are being evicted from their homes.

Home to many Africans, Guangzhou has long been one of China\u2019s main commercial and trading centers. One report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as \"\"Little Africa\"\" are being forced to remain inside their apartments \u2014 even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine \u2014 and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to Al Jazeera. President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. But China has denied racism in the effort. But the actions are widespread enough, according to the Associated Press, that African officials are confronting China over racist treatment of Africans, including Africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe said: \"\"It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents. China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\"\" The Guangdong provincial government has responded to concerns about discrimination by calling China and Africa good friends, partners and brothers, according to the BBC. More than two dozen Africans told CNN about being left without a home, being subject to random testing for COVID-19, or being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Photos and videos posted on social media showed Africans sleeping on sidewalks or waiting under shop awnings after being ordered out of their apartments and hotel rooms, the Washington Post reported. And community leaders told the BBC that hundreds of Africans had been evicted after online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among African people. A video shared on Facebook claims that \"\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold.\"\" Numerous news articles report that, amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, China has focused on foreigners as a possible source of the virus, and Africans in the southern China city of Guangzhou are being evicted from their homes. African leaders have called out the evictions as racist.\"n\nClaim: \u201cAfricans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold\u201d as \u201cChinese nationals blame them for the rising number of new coronavirus cases in the country.\u201d\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"True. The evidence provided clearly shows that Africans in China, particularly in Guangzhou, are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to COVID-19 fears. There are numerous legitimate news reports, eye-witness accounts, and social media posts confirming that Africans are being forced to sleep outside in the cold due to fears of a second wave of the coronavirus. Therefore, the claim that Africans in China are being forced to sleep outside is true based on the evidence provided."}

The evidence provided explains that while BHA has been found to be carcinogenic in lab rats and is listed as a known carcinogen by the California State Regulatory Program, it is still considered safe by the FDA at current levels of use in human and dog food. More research is needed to definitively determine the safety of BHA in relation to cancer in humans and dogs. Therefore, the claim is not confirmed to be true or false based on the evidence given."}

Lewandowski allegedly grabbed Fields\u2019 arm and pulled her away, leaving bruises. When news of the incident started to spread, Lewandowski tweeted at Fields, saying, \"\"you are totally delusional. I never touched you.\"\" But security footage of the event released by the Jupiter Police Department March 29 appears to show Lewandowski grabbing Fields. (video from the Washington Post) Despite the recent video, Trump said Lewandowski didn\u2019t misrepresent what happened.

Seriously, just stop lying.\"\" Did Fields change her story on what happened between her and Lewandowski? It appears not. We couldn\u2019t find an example of her publicly retelling what happened since the second week of March when the story first unfolded. And since the security footage became public March 29, Fields has not yet given an interview. We tried to reach Trump and Fields and did not hear back. At the CNN town hall, Trump said Fields\u2019 initial claim was that she fell to the ground or that she almost fell to the ground. It was the latter. \"\"I was jolted backwards,\"\" Fields wrote March 10. \"\"Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken.\"\" The Washington Post\u2019s Ben Terris witnessed the incident and wrote a similar account the same day. \"\"As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit ballroom, (Fields) pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question,\"\" Terris wrote. \"\"I watched as a man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s 41-year-old campaign manager.\"\" Lewandowski and the Trump campaign immediately denied Fields\u2019 accusation. \"\"The accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false,\"\" spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. \"\"As one of the dozens of individuals present as Mr. Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.\"\" Fields stood by her account of what happened in a March 14 interview with Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly. \"\"This is a campaign that continues to lie,\"\" she said. \"\"I never wanted it to get this way. Those bruises will heal. My problem is the smearing of my name, my reputation.\"\" Following the incident, Breitbart editor-at-large Joel Pollak published a report where he questioned whether it was actually Lewandowski who grabbed Fields rather than another man. Claiming Breitbart was standing with the Trump campaign instead of its own employees, Fields and several other Breitbart employees resigned. Since the security footage came out in the past couple days, though, Pollak has admitted that his report was incorrect. Trump, conversely, said the footage \"\"exonerates\"\" Lewandowski \"\"totally.\"\" It doesn\u2019t; it looks from the video as if he did grab her \u2014 and the police report says the video is consistent with what Fields\u00a0alleged. Trump also criticized Fields for allegedly grabbing him to ask a question and for holding a pen. While somewhat expected for a reporter to have a pen handy, Trump said it could have been a \"\"little bomb\"\" or a knife.

She went to the ground. When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed. She didn't talk about it.\"\" Trump asked on Twitter why no one was checking to see how Fields\u2019 story changed, and Fields responded, \"\"Because my story never changed. Seriously, just stop lying.\"\" Did Fields change her story on what happened between her and Lewandowski? It appears not. We couldn\u2019t find an example of her publicly retelling what happened since the second week of March when the story first unfolded. And since the security footage became public March 29, Fields has not yet given an interview. We tried to reach Trump and Fields and did not hear back. At the CNN town hall, Trump said Fields\u2019 initial claim was that she fell to the ground or that she almost fell to the ground. It was the latter. \"\"I was jolted backwards,\"\" Fields wrote March 10. \"\"Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken.\"\" The Washington Post\u2019s Ben Terris witnessed the incident and wrote a similar account the same day. \"\"As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit ballroom, (Fields) pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question,\"\" Terris wrote. \"\"I watched as a man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s 41-year-old campaign manager.\"\" Lewandowski and the Trump campaign immediately denied Fields\u2019 accusation. \"\"The accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false,\"\" spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. \"\"As one of the dozens of individuals present as Mr. Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.\"\" Fields stood by her account of what happened in a March 14 interview with Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly. \"\"This is a campaign that continues to lie,\"\" she said. \"\"I never wanted it to get this way. Those bruises will heal. My problem is the smearing of my name, my reputation.\"\" Following the incident, Breitbart editor-at-large Joel Pollak published a report where he questioned whether it was actually Lewandowski who grabbed Fields rather than another man. Claiming Breitbart was standing with the Trump campaign instead of its own employees, Fields and several other Breitbart employees resigned. Since the security footage came out in the past couple days, though, Pollak has admitted that his report was incorrect. Trump, conversely, said the footage \"\"exonerates\"\" Lewandowski \"\"totally.\"\" It doesn\u2019t; it looks from the video as if he did grab her \u2014 and the police report says the video is consistent with what Fields\u00a0alleged. Trump also criticized Fields for allegedly grabbing him to ask a question and for holding a pen. While somewhat expected for a reporter to have a pen handy, Trump said it could have been a \"\"little bomb\"\" or a knife. Our ruling Trump said that when Michelle Fields \"\"found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.\"\" We see no evidence that Fields\u2019 story about her altercation with Trump\u2019s campaign manager has changed. She gave an initial account and hasn't backed off of it.\"n\nClaim: \"Donald Trump Says that when Michelle Fields \"\"found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that Donald Trump said when Michelle Fields found out there was security camera footage, her story changed is false. The evidence provided shows that Fields' story has remained consistent since the incident on March 8, and she has not given any interviews or changed her account since the security footage was released on March 29. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that her story changed after the security footage was revealed."}

The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women. This is not the first time a discovery of human remains with elongated skulls sparked the hopes of UFO enthusiasts. A 2015 discovery of a prehistoric woman in Russia, at a site known as Arkaim or \u201cRussia\u2019s Stonehenge,\u201d with a similar deformity also created a buzz: Some believe that the skull\u2019s high forehead is characteristic of the so-called \u201calien grey\u201d often depicted as large-eyed and large-foreheaded beings in sci-fi films and even hoaxes. Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to.

{"claim_id":9245,"hypothesis":"Even partial steroid treatment can benefit extremely preterm infants, NIH study suggests","date_published":"October 18, 2016","explanation_1":"This news release by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) covers research findings on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment in pregnant women expecting preterm delivery, as published in JAMA Pediatrics. Although women likely to deliver before 34 weeks are routinely given steroid treatment to reduce the chance of complications, physicians weren\u2019t sure whether a partial course of treatment would provide the same \u2014 or any \u2014 benefits. In this new study, researchers concluded that ANS therapy was dose-dependent in providing protective effects against death or neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm infants. The release claims that even partial steroid treatment can\u00a0 benefit those born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. Details on funding sources and treatment\u2019s context are given high up in the news release. It also starts out well by providing some relevant figures, such as the number of subjects in the study, their gestational ages and follow-up times. However, other important quantitative data aren\u2019t disclosed at all, such as the extent of the treatment\u2019s benefits in the three groups, as well as the costs associated with steroid therapy. Instead, only sweeping, vague comparative language is used to illustrate complications and other outcomes, which leaves the reader wondering how beneficial steroid treatment really is. Another major point that was not mentioned was the study\u2019s limitations \u2014 namely that this was an observational cohort study that cannot establish cause and effect. Patients were not blinded to their treatments and were not randomized, which led to an unequal distribution of patients in the 3 groups in terms of socioeconomic status and other infant variables. In the end, the complete ANS treatment group already had distinct advantages from these factors in achieving better outcomes. Although studies on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment already exist in the body of literature, there hasn\u2019t been much research looking at dose-dependent effects of ANS on extremely premature infants, especially in regard to early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other studies have looked into partial ANS courses and rates of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease among infants. Steroids are routinely given to pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks and are considered to be standard treatment. However, there is no clear protocol on administering ANS treatment when premature delivery is approaching, since completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours. If the latest research shows that even partial ANS treatment provides benefits to preterm infants, this should be reported to empower patients and to guide clinical practice.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"The two antenatal steroids (ANS) used in this study included betamethasone and dexamethasone, but their costs were never mentioned.

According to drugs.com, 500 mL of dexamethasone costs $23.94. Our online search didn\u2019t uncover any price estimates for liquid Betamethasone. Drugs.com only lists topical Betamethasone prices.

It\u2019s worth noting here that the actual costs of the steroids pale in comparison to the cost of the overall treatment of these infants.

Although the news release gives figures for the number of study participants and their gestational ages, it doesn\u2019t provide any quantitative data on the benefits of steroid therapy.

One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves. The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study\u2019s findings\u00a0(such as the\u00a0researchers\u2019 conclusions that\u00a0the results are of \u201cuncertain clinical importance\u201d). It also attempts to discuss cost, but provides no prices, and doesn\u2019t go far enough in detailing the potential harms of either treatment. And, because\u00a0the story\u2019s only interviewed\u00a0source has\u00a0potential conflicts of interest,\u00a0independent scrutiny was needed. Urinary incontinence is common, affecting millions of individuals, both women and men. The prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal result of aging. The condition is more prevalent in women, though beyond the age of 80, both men and women reportedly have similar rates. The kind of incontinence studied here\u2013\u201csevere refractory urge incontinence\u201d\u2013specifically means a person has an abnormally frequent urge to urinate, and it is\u00a0resistant to standard treatments.","fact_checkers":"Dave Mosher,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Joy Victory","premise":"We hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day.

Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com.

The 61 obese adults in the study were taking either insulin or oral anti-diabetic medication, were mostly women and Caucasian, and were followed for three years.

The article would have benefited from some information about the costs and potential harms of bariatric surgery, as well as details on availability and barriers to access for these procedures. Several types of surgery that essentially restrict stomach size and bypass portions of the intestine that absorb nutrients have been shown to result in long-term weight loss.

And as this new study suggests \u2014 and for reasons the article makes clear are not completely understood \u2014 the surgical treatments appear to not only significantly reduce weight, but also alter the biology of glucose and diabetic risk. They seem to do this better than lifestyle -based interventions, which often produce limited reductions in weight that returns all too quickly. Stories like this matter, not only because of the potential impact on public health, but also because bariatric surgery is expensive and has become a marketing opportunity for many medical centers and clinics.
