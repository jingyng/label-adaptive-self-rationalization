Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\" We won\u2019t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, \u00a0healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these \"\"major\"\" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. If all regulations were counted, Obama\u2019s record would be nowhere near Portman\u2019s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. But Portman said \"\"major\"\" rules.\"\" \"\"Major\"\" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them \"\"economically significant\"\" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to \"\"major\"\" that there is no need to split hairs here. We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. One was provided by Portman\u2019s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. Portman\u2019s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama\u2019s tenure with the first three of Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president\u2019s term. Portman\u2019s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. A similar analysis by George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman\u2019s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama\u2019s first term. This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman\u2019s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"\"major\"\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term.

They are calling for action to reduce BPA exposure, especially among vulnerable groups like babies and pregnant women. The evidence also shows that some European countries have already taken unilateral action on BPA, and experts estimate that BPA is detectable in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. and European population. Therefore, the claim that experts are demanding European action on the plastics chemical is true based on the evidence provided."}
{"claim_id":34166,"hypothesis":"In October 2019, the Rev. Robert Morey of St. Anthony's parish in Florence, South Carolina, refused former Vice President Joe Biden the Catholic rite of communion.","date_published":"October 30, 2019","explanation_1":"Until and unless we receive information that corroborates Morey\u2019s account.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights. The story was covered by several major national news outlets\u00a0but originated in a statement sent to the Florence Morning News by Robert Morey, a priest in the Catholic parish of St. Anthony in Florence, South Carolina. On Oct. 28, the Morning News reported that: Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church\u2019s 9 a.m. Mass\u2026 \u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Morey told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey added. Asked by Snopes to confirm, deny, or clarify Morey\u2019s account, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment on the story. Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":7484,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights.

Anecdotal reports of renal failure attributed to Temptations appeared on consumer complaint sites and were reproduced on cat owners\u2019 message boards, but those reports were unsubstantiated. When pets suddenly fall ill, their owners can be\u00a0quick to blame the last food consumed or product to which they were exposed, but it\u2019s often difficult to figure out\u00a0whether other factors were definitively ruled out, or how such a conclusion was reached. It\u2019s also not uncommon for claims\u00a0to be repeated across multiple\u00a0platforms, creating the impression of myriad\u00a0reports based upon a single source rumor.

Anecdotal reports of renal failure attributed to Temptations appeared on consumer complaint sites and were reproduced on cat owners\u2019 message boards, but those reports were unsubstantiated. When pets suddenly fall ill, their owners can be\u00a0quick to blame the last food consumed or product to which they were exposed, but it\u2019s often difficult to figure out\u00a0whether other factors were definitively ruled out, or how such a conclusion was reached. It\u2019s also not uncommon for claims\u00a0to be repeated across multiple\u00a0platforms, creating the impression of myriad\u00a0reports based upon a single source rumor. When that happens, suspicious pet owners who turned\u00a0to Google will\u00a0infer that their concerns reflected a widespread pattern, rather than reiterations\u00a0of widely repeated rumors. On 2 March 2016, the page deleted the Temptations cat treats warning and stated: UPDATE: Due to the overwhelming response to my post about what happened to MY cats, and just simply trying to share information from MY vet, I\u2019ve decided to take down the original post. I cannot keep up with the thread and my babies care comes first. I will update here when the analysis comes back for those who are interested. The original posts intention was to share information about what I had learned from my vet about my cats and what had happened to them. I was hoping that people would see that sharing information is supposed to be just that:informative. All I asked was to watch your babies closely and for well wishes for my babies. I NEVER said to stop feeding them Temptations treats. I left that decision to other pet parents to decide for themselves. Thank you to those who have voiced concern for my cats. They are all showing improvement. We were unable to turn up any substantiated complaints of renal failure in cats attributed to (or deemed likely caused by) Temptations treats. On 3 March 2016, Temptations responded to our query, noting that the pet snacks were manufactured in Canada (not China, as many Facebook users speculated) and thus subject to stringent oversight: Thank you for the message.n\nClaim: Temptations cat treats are causing renal failure in cats.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Not enough information.\n\nThere is no concrete evidence or substantiated complaints of renal failure in cats caused by Temptations cat treats. Anecdotal reports and rumors were circulating, but nothing was definitively proven. Additionally, the company behind Temptations stated that their treats undergo quality checks and are subject to stringent oversight. Therefore, without any verified cases, it is not possible to confirm the claim as true, false, or partially true and false."}
{"claim_id":34678,"hypothesis":"The red dye commonly used in nectar for backyard feeders is harmful to hummingbirds.","date_published":"September 12, 2003","explanation_1":"Some bird lovers fear the presence of their nectar dispensers will tempt the little birds to delay migration, causing coddled hummers to become trapped by the sudden onset of cold weather. Yet they need not so fearful, because the hummingbird\u2019s instinct to migrate is too strong to be sidetracked. When it\u2019s time to go, they know.","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"In the 1970s DDT, a highly effective pesticide then widely in use in the U.S., was believed to be threatening the continuation of a number of bird species. Reports claimed that bald eagles, ospreys, and peregrine falcons exposed to the chemical laid eggs with abnormally thin shells which broke during incubation and resulted in markedly fewer successful hatchings, so new generations were not surviving to replace earlier ones as older birds died off. Because of this looming extinction threat, DDT was subjected to a domestic ban in 1972. Once the pesticide was removed from the environment, the population levels of the endangered birds returned to near their previous levels. (Later studies indicated that factors other than DDT use were likely responsible for most of the decline.) Half-remembered fragments of the many news stories about the effects of DDT on those threatened raptors may have contributed to a related widespread conviction regarding hummingbirds \u2014 that the red dye commonly added to the nectar used in hummingbird feeders works to thin the shells of their eggs, placing them in similar jeopardy: Examples: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] This morning I got a stern lecture from the checkout lady at the grocery store because I was buying red food coloring to use in a hummingbird feeder. \u201cDon\u2019t you know red food coloring weakens their egg shells?\u201d she demanded. [Collected via e-mail, 2001] I have heard that the use of red dye in Humming Bird feeders will wipe out the family of the birds using the feeder in three generations. The dye is surposed to weaken the eggs. Or the suspicion could have been fueled by a more general wariness attached to red dyes, especially in the wake of the longstanding controversy over Red Dye #3, a colorant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned for a number of uses of in 1990 after it was linked to the development of thyroid tumors in male rats. (Red Dye #2 has been banned by the FDA since 1976.) For whatever reason, many folks have come to suspect the color additive in hummingbird nectar poses a danger to the little creatures, with the \u201cIt thins the shells of their eggs\u201d belief heard most often as the specific harm wrought by the coloring. Others reasons claimed for avoiding red dye include a fear the substance will build up in hummingbirds\u2019 kidneys or livers, or that new hatchlings whose mothers partook of the sweet will be born blind or deformed. The red dye traditionally added to attract hummers to nectar dispensers may never have been necessary anyway. While it is true hummingbirds are drawn to red, there is more than one way to entice a bird. According to an entry found in the Audubon Society\u2019s FAQ: Current thinking is that the red dye may not be good for them, nor is it necessary to attract hummingbirds. The color on your feeder is enough to attract them. You can mix your own nectar using 1\/4 cup sugar to every 1 cup of water. The Audubon Society\u2019s page does not detail the harm it fears dye could potentially cause. We\u2019re unaware of any definitive study either linking the colorant to a particular illness in hummingbirds or demonstrating it to be harmless. Anecdotal evidence postulates a causal connection with beak and liver tumors. Rather than take a chance with the little birds\u2019 health, many bird fanciers have chosen to omit red dye from the liquid feed they offer their airborne visitors. A mixture of 1 cup of sugar to 4 cups of water makes a perfectly serviceable nectar. (Do not use honey in place of sugar, because it can promote the growth of a fungus that kills hummers.) Dye is unnecessary in the mix because the birds are already attracted to the red coloring of the feeders themselves. But do keep those feeders clean, because the sugar\/water mix can ferment fairly quickly in the summer sun, making it bad for the very wildlife it\u2019s meant to energize. The feeding of hummingbirds has attracted a second rumor, one of a more sinister nature: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] I heard that a man was recently arrested for cruelty to animals after starving a number of humming birds by putting out feeders with nutra-sweet in them. We haven\u2019t found a news account or other report of any such incident. Moreover, hummingbirds generally draw their sustenance from spiders, flies, gnats, and other insects they eat, not from the sweet nectar they sip. The sugary liquid provides extra energy to the birds, but it\u2019s not their primary source of nutrition.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Critter Country, hummingbirds, red dye, Wild Inaccuracies","__index_level_0__":2699,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn the 1970s DDT, a highly effective pesticide then widely in use in the U.S., was believed to be threatening the continuation of a number of bird species.

Appended pictures appear to show squares of missing hair at her hairline and the base of her neck. Also missing from the first-person account was information about whether the product demonstrated signs of tampering. Nair and other hair removal creams have a distinct, overpowering scent similar to sulfur, which is stronger still when it is undiluted.The New Richmond Police Department put out a press release saying they are investigating the incident:On July 28, 2019 The New Richmond Police Department received a complaint of alleged product tampering. A 21 year old female subject indicated she used hair conditioner, recently purchased, and upon using the product for the first time reported immediate significant hair loss on her head. The product was reported to have a different smell and color than the original product. Product tampering can be a felony offense and is cited under Wisconsin State Statute 941.327. Due to the significance of this offense, New Richmond officers and detectives have been working with Wal-Mart staff to identify potential suspects and review video surveillance. The New Richmond Police Department will continue to follow the facts of this case.While this appears to be an isolated case at this time, the New Richmond Police Department is asking anyone in this area that has been a recent victim of this type of activity to please report it immediately to your local police\/sheriff\u2019s department.The New Richmond Police Department is also reminding people to be diligent in checking products for safety seals and prior to any use to make sure it is consistent with the product you are expecting.Some news sites reported on the Facebook post as an isolated incident (\u201cWoman loses hair \u2018in clumps\u2019 after Nair was allegedly mixed into conditioner bought at Walmart\u201d), while others leapt to the conclusion that this was a trend:People Are Now Putting Hair Removal Creme In Shampoo BottlesSomeone had replaced the brand new product with Nair hair removal creme.I remember the rumors about people putting Nair in the conditioner and shampoo bottles of their worst enemies, but this is something entirely worse! Continuing into the post, she claims that she reported the incident to local police, and they are working to watch camera footage from the Walmart, to see if they can get to the bottom of the incident.Warning! People Are Putting Hair Removal Cream in Shampoo BottlesGreat, it looks like we all have one more thing to worry about. A mother is urging shoppers who purchase products at Walmart to double-check if any of the items have been tampered with before buying them. This after her daughter discovered her conditioner bottle contained Nair inside the product. Nair is a hair removal product that works by breaking the \u201cdisulfide bonds of the keratin molecules in hair\u201d which makes it easier for hair to be wiped away easily without using a razor.As the first of the two sites noted above, claims about contaminating conditioner with hair removal creams like Nair are old urban legends, which does not mean that someone, somewhere has not attempted to execute such a prank. Further, the post alludes to targeting a person in that fashion; as presented, the purported victim in the Facebook posts appeared to have been randomly selected.In the second excerpt, the site made reference to the manner in which Nair and other chemical depilatories function. In contrast with most conditioners (which sit on the hair for one to three minutes), Nair and hair removal creams sit on the skin for five to ten minutes \u2014 or even longer \u2014 to dissolve hair. On their website, Nair provides the following instructions for one product:Smooth on a thick, even layer to cover hair. Leave cream on for 5 minutes.Check a small area for hair removal. If your hair is thick, you may need more time. (Don\u2019t leave on longer than 10 minutes. )Gently wipe off the cream and hair with a damp washcloth. Don\u2019t rub!Rumors about contaminating conditioner (or shampoo) with Nair very likely antedate the internet. However, their plausibility was discussed on the Straight Dope message board back in 2001; forum members provided a laundry list of reasons the prank was impractical. It was cited other forums in undated posts, and appeared in 2010 on a forum for people with long hair. In an unrelated 2010 video, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d prank appeared on YouTube.In 2016, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d rumor was the subject of a viral hoax. In 2018, a Reddit user claimed a disgruntled roommate put hair removal cream in her shampoo, and that same year the likelihood of the prank working was discussed on Quora. On the latter post, a self-identified hairdresser claimed to have witnessed the aftermath of one such incident.In photographs, the woman making the claims appeared to be missing neatly bordered sections of scalp hair, not a diffuse amount throughout her scalp. Conditioner is distributed through hair, and whether strands had been shortened or unevenly dissolved was also not clear from the photographs.In the photograph on the left side of Timm\u2019s post, the conditioner is shown to be a large bottle with a pump, supposedly purchased just two days earlier. Hair removal cream surreptitiously added to the bottle in a Walmart aisle would be situated at the top and unlikely to move to the bottom of the bottle, whereas the pump would retrieve product from the bottom up. If an ill-intentioned shopper decanted hair removal cream into a very large pump bottle of conditioner, it seemed unlikely the affected product would migrate into the pump in the first day or two of use.It is also possible that the uneven distribution was due to a tampered but unshaken product, where pockets of pure \u201cNair\u201d were next to pockets of conditioner. However, massaging the product through hair ought to have diluted the \u201cNair\u201d as well, making it less efficient. Presumably, a then-diluted formula would have sat on the skin for a shorter period of time than five minutes, lowering the possibility of hairless patches.Another issue is that the articles quoted above asserted that \u201cpeople\u201d are \u201cnow putting\u201d hair removal cream in conditioner; we found no other reports of such tampering in the time period during which the reports appeared. We emailed Nair for information about the feasibility of the rumor, but have not yet received a response.In short, a woman claimed that a chemical hair remover\u00a0was added to hair conditioner she purchased at Walmart, leading to hair loss. It is possible that Nair-tainted conditioner caused the hair loss shown here, but it is also possible that the hair loss was due to another reason and that the poster assumed that unexpected loss of hair was because of product tampering. The latter issue\u00a0\u2014 product tampering in a store\u00a0\u2014 had been recently\u00a0reported, making it a possibility that news about product tampering led the woman to conclude that it had also happened to her.We found no additional, similar reports to suggest that the claim indicated a widespread trend. Articles claiming it was more than an isolated assertion were misleading.We will update this story as more\u00a0details become available.","sources":"https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/officemax-bullet-resistant-backpack\/, https:\/\/longhaircareforum.com\/threads\/nair-in-the-shampoo.489748\/page-2, https:\/\/rare.us\/rare-life\/nair-inside-shampoo-bottles\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fnair-conditioner-hair-loss%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Is+Someone+Putting+Nair+in+Hair+Conditioner+Bottles%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fnair-conditioner-hair-loss%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ashley.robinson.3785373\/posts\/2751216868239591, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-this-a-feminist-exposing-herself-to-students-during-a-field-trip\/, http:\/\/howtorevenge.com\/articles\/nair-shampoo-bathroom-prank-idea\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/taffy.j.timm\/posts\/10219141697029289, https:\/\/www.amirite.com\/294648, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/newrichmondpolicedepartmentwi\/posts\/2389990687713245, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fnair-conditioner-hair-loss%2F, http:\/\/www.fox5ny.com\/news\/woman-loses-hair-in-clumps-after-nair-was-allegedly-mixed-into-conditioner-bought-at-walmart, http:\/\/www.westchestermagazine.com\/Blogs\/Eat-Drink-Post\/July-2008\/Eeeeew-the-Health-Code-Violation-Near-You\/, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fnair-conditioner-hair-loss%2F, https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/weird-news\/meet-girl-who-thought-hair-8517748, https:\/\/awarenessact.com\/people-are-now-putting-hair-removal-creme-in-shampoo-botles\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/8vgrmc\/roommate_put_nair_in_my_shampoo_should_i_press\/, http:\/\/www.naircare.com\/en\/Women\/Products\/Nair-Face-Cream-Moisturizing-With-Sweet-Almond-Oil, https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/davidmack\/police-identify-blue-bell-ice-cream-licker, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oQaqZQK24_4, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/tag\/engagement-bait, https:\/\/boards.straightdope.com\/sdmb\/showthread.php?t=102744, https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Has-anyone-experienced-having-had-Nair-hair-removal-product-put-in-their-shampoo-or-conditioner-as-a-prank-If-so-what-symptoms-did-it-cause, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":1,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1572,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nA pair of posts shared to Facebook on July 28 and 29 2019 carried a warning to consumers, claiming that a woman\u2019s hair had \u201cfallen out in clumps\u201d because someone had added Nair (or another cream-based depilatory) to conditioner purchased at Walmart.The first post was shared by the mother of the woman who purportedly bought the adulterated conditioner.

If an ill-intentioned shopper decanted hair removal cream into a very large pump bottle of conditioner, it seemed unlikely the affected product would migrate into the pump in the first day or two of use.It is also possible that the uneven distribution was due to a tampered but unshaken product, where pockets of pure \u201cNair\u201d were next to pockets of conditioner. However, massaging the product through hair ought to have diluted the \u201cNair\u201d as well, making it less efficient. Presumably, a then-diluted formula would have sat on the skin for a shorter period of time than five minutes, lowering the possibility of hairless patches.Another issue is that the articles quoted above asserted that \u201cpeople\u201d are \u201cnow putting\u201d hair removal cream in conditioner; we found no other reports of such tampering in the time period during which the reports appeared. We emailed Nair for information about the feasibility of the rumor, but have not yet received a response.In short, a woman claimed that a chemical hair remover\u00a0was added to hair conditioner she purchased at Walmart, leading to hair loss. It is possible that Nair-tainted conditioner caused the hair loss shown here, but it is also possible that the hair loss was due to another reason and that the poster assumed that unexpected loss of hair was because of product tampering. The latter issue\u00a0\u2014 product tampering in a store\u00a0\u2014 had been recently\u00a0reported, making it a possibility that news about product tampering led the woman to conclude that it had also happened to her.We found no additional, similar reports to suggest that the claim indicated a widespread trend. Articles claiming it was more than an isolated assertion were misleading.We will update this story as more\u00a0details become available.n\nClaim: People are putting hair removal creams in conditioner, causing hair loss.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim is not enough information to confirm.

Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000.

He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago\u2019s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. \"\"Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft,\"\" he said. \"\"Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return,\"\" he said, later adding, \"\"It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws,\"\" the verdict means \"\"it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance.\"\" In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is \"\"one way\"\" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert\u2019s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich \"\"is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law.\"\" The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one\u2019s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person \"\"reasonably believes\"\" such force is necessary to prevent imminent \"\"theft during the nighttime\"\" or \"\"criminal mischief during the nighttime.\"\" Jurors concluded that the \"\"theft\"\" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. \"\"She was committing a scam,\"\" he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn\u2019t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. \"\"It is not open season on prostitutes\"\" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. \"\"This has gone, as you know, viral with \u2018It\u2019s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,\u2019 \u2018Stupid Texans and their guns,\u2019 \"\" he said. \"\"Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted.\"\" As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, \"\"You cannot under any circumstances do so.\"\" University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, \"\"Reich, in my view, is simply wrong.\"\" Frago and Gilbert\u2019s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. \"\"What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money,\"\" he said. \"\"In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than \u2018just\u2019 a contractual dispute,\"\" Dix said. \"\"It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid.\"\" Even so, he said, \"\"The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft.\"\" That\u2019s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich\u2019s assertion, the jury didn\u2019t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force. Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it\u2019s not a \"\"public nuisance\"\" in Texas law. It\u2019s classified under \"\"public indecency\"\" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich\u2019s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: \"\"Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief,\"\" Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person\u2019s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. \"\"It\u2019s a ridiculous statement.\"\" Dix said, \"\"I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can \u2018shoot someone who\u2019s committing a \"\"public nuisance\"\" under the cover of dark.\u2019 It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage.\"\" Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified \"\"during the nighttime.\"\" Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because \"\"sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless.\"\" Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, \"\"it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 under the cover of dark,\"\" claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it\u2019s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance. Legal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a \"\"public nuisance\"\" in Texas; and state law doesn\u2019t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances.

Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich \"\"is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law.\"\" The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one\u2019s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person \"\"reasonably believes\"\" such force is necessary to prevent imminent \"\"theft during the nighttime\"\" or \"\"criminal mischief during the nighttime.\"\" Jurors concluded that the \"\"theft\"\" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. \"\"She was committing a scam,\"\" he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn\u2019t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. \"\"It is not open season on prostitutes\"\" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. \"\"This has gone, as you know, viral with \u2018It\u2019s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,\u2019 \u2018Stupid Texans and their guns,\u2019 \"\" he said. \"\"Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted.\"\" As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, \"\"You cannot under any circumstances do so.\"\" University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, \"\"Reich, in my view, is simply wrong.\"\" Frago and Gilbert\u2019s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. \"\"What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money,\"\" he said. \"\"In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than \u2018just\u2019 a contractual dispute,\"\" Dix said. \"\"It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid.\"\" Even so, he said, \"\"The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft.\"\" That\u2019s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich\u2019s assertion, the jury didn\u2019t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force. Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it\u2019s not a \"\"public nuisance\"\" in Texas law. It\u2019s classified under \"\"public indecency\"\" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich\u2019s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: \"\"Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief,\"\" Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person\u2019s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. \"\"It\u2019s a ridiculous statement.\"\" Dix said, \"\"I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can \u2018shoot someone who\u2019s committing a \"\"public nuisance\"\" under the cover of dark.\u2019 It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage.\"\" Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified \"\"during the nighttime.\"\" Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because \"\"sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless.\"\" Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, \"\"it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 under the cover of dark,\"\" claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it\u2019s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance. Legal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a \"\"public nuisance\"\" in Texas; and state law doesn\u2019t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances. Notably, too, the law includes many other restrictions on deadly force, not just what type of crime is being committed.\"n\nClaim: \"Robert Reich Says in Texas \"\"it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 under the cover of dark.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that Robert Reich says in Texas it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a 'public nuisance' under the cover of dark is false. The evidence provided clearly shows that legal experts, a lawyer involved in the murder trial, and other sources state that Reich's assertion is incorrect. The verdict in the mentioned trial hinged on theft, not on prostitution being considered a public nuisance, and state law does not permit deadly force to be used on people creating nuisances. Additionally, other restrictions on the use of deadly force are outlined in Texas law. Therefore, the claim is false based on the evidence presented."}

A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It\u2019s another thing to say what state Rep. William \"\"Billy\"\" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically \"\"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are the \"\"most polluted\"\" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. \"\"There are so many things that \u2018pollute\u2019 our rivers \u2014 GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,\"\" Raabe said. \"\"The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity.\"\" Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. \"\"The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,\"\" Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn\u2019t have a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) \"\"does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,\"\" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said.

{"claim_id":10255,"hypothesis":"Study Finds Single, Escalated Dose of Brachytherapy Radiation May Be a Safe and Effective Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer","date_published":"March 3, 2017","explanation_1":"This news release from a professional society of radiation oncologists summarizes a trial in 58 men with Stage 1 localized prostate cancer that found using a single treatment of\u00a0high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (where radioactive implants are inserted directly into the tissue) may be an acceptable and safe alternative to typical longer, but lower doses of radiation. Recognizing\u00a0that a higher dose, single radiation treatment could be more toxic to tissues surrounding the prostate, this trial set out to measure the effectiveness and safety of such treatment. While the research was non-randomized, its generally positive tone was balanced by\u00a0emphasizing that there needs to be additional follow-up research to see how it compares with conventional approaches. After stating in the headline the treatment \u201cmay be safe and effective,\u201d the release provides a fairly detailed description of harms. A concern with this study is that nearly all of the patient volunteers would have been candidates for active surveillance\u2013meaning that they did not need an active treatment. With no caveat that expert guidelines recommend surveillance for low-risk Stage 1 prostate cancers, this release engages in disease-mongering. It is recognized that exposure to radioactive treatments can be harmful and so finding other ways to treat tumors in the prostate should be welcomed. If a treatment for localized prostate cancer which is\u00a0administered in a single procedure, is equally effective and safe as conventional treatment, it is possible that patients may have fewer side effects and adverse events related to their prostate cancer treatment. This\u00a0study provides some\u00a0data on the safety and tolerability of the single dose of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy compared to\u00a0LDR brachytherapy, \u00a0It is important to note that these patients were a very select sample of prostate cancer patients (low to intermediate risk) and so extrapolating those findings to other prostate cancer patients may not be appropriate.","fact_checkers":"Alan Cassels,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"There was zero mention of cost, which is unfortunate because presumably a single treatment would entail fewer costs than one that involved multiple procedures. The main benefit focused on a vaguely described \u201cbiochemical progression,\u201d which means that there was some evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Determining PSA progression is more complicated following radiation because it takes time for the PSA level to stabilize (unlike following surgery to remove the prostate) before you can determine whether the PSA is rising. Biochemical progression is also a surrogate measure and does not imply that the cancer is\u2013or will\u2013clinically progress. The researchers did acknowledge that the actual benefits are unknown, saying that \u201cas the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d The release provided detailed information on harms: \u201cWithin the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency\/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\u201d But given that many oncology experts would consider the treatment unnecessary, any level of toxicity\u00a0could be considered unacceptable. The lay reader would have benefited from a description of what \u201cgrade 2 or grad 3+\u201d levels of toxicity means. There were a few issues that could have been clarified: the fact that these men were quite low risk to start with, that five of the initial patients dropped out of the study (and we aren\u2019t told why) and that this was a non-randomized, prospective clinical trial which is potentially subject to a series of biases. The key takeaway is that this evidence does not establish the superiority of this approach to any other radiotherapy, any active treatment, or active surveillance. The quote from a study author at the end of the release indicating that more research was required and this study was not definitive proof of the superiority of the 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy was a welcome caution, and somewhat at odds with the overall positive tone of the release. Promoting brachytherapy radiation for treatment of low-risk men is a form of disease-mongering, particularly since there is no mention of the surveillance option. The American Urological Association (AUA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that men with low-risk cancers be offered active surveillance. The release doesn\u2019t tell us who sponsored the study. The published report indicated there were no conflicts of interest. The release says the study compared safety and effectiveness of single high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy to longer courses of HDR treatment and that this alternative \u201cmay or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d This sounds inconclusive. Just what are the \u201chistorical standards?\u201d And why talk about \u201ccure\u201d rates? A recently published randomized trial (PROTECT, Hamdy et al. NEJM, September 2016) of active monitoring, radiotherapy, and surgery for men with localized cancer found a 99% prostate-cancer specific survival for all treatment arms through 10 years of follow up. Speaking of a \u201ccure\u201d rate for low-risk\u00a0disease that does not need to be cured is very misleading. H. Gilbert Welch, MD, MPH. professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute, has described these low risk diseases as \u201cpseudo disease.\u201d The release doesn\u2019t address availability but high dose brachytherapy has been available for years\u2013and a Google search reveals many sites offering this treatment. The news release suggests that this is a new strategy based on new research but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. According to UpToDate, an evidence-based list of practice recommendations published by Wolters Kluwer, use of single, high dose brachytherapy for prostate cancer is not novel: \u201cThe HDR brachytherapy dose is usually administered in one to four large dose fractions over a period of time, typically 24 to 40 hours. Patients receiving more than one fraction are usually admitted to the hospital (typically a 23 hour \u201coutpatient stay\u201d) for treatment when delivering multiple fractions and retain the perineal catheters in place for the entire period.\u201d The release detracts from the actual study when it states that the research \u201cillustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation\u2026\u201d \u00a0This seems unjustified in the context of the trial.

If possible, is it necessary?\u201d","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/iStock_371304_SMALL.jpg,http:\/\/www.redjournal.org\/article\/S0360-3016(16)33096-6\/abstract","label":2,"subjects":"Association\/Society news release","__index_level_0__":3605,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThere was zero mention of cost, which is unfortunate because presumably a single treatment would entail fewer costs than one that involved multiple procedures. The main benefit focused on a vaguely described \u201cbiochemical progression,\u201d which means that there was some evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Determining PSA progression is more complicated following radiation because it takes time for the PSA level to stabilize (unlike following surgery to remove the prostate) before you can determine whether the PSA is rising. Biochemical progression is also a surrogate measure and does not imply that the cancer is\u2013or will\u2013clinically progress. The researchers did acknowledge that the actual benefits are unknown, saying that \u201cas the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d The release provided detailed information on harms: \u201cWithin the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency\/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\u201d But given that many oncology experts would consider the treatment unnecessary, any level of toxicity\u00a0could be considered unacceptable. The lay reader would have benefited from a description of what \u201cgrade 2 or grad 3+\u201d levels of toxicity means. There were a few issues that could have been clarified: the fact that these men were quite low risk to start with, that five of the initial patients dropped out of the study (and we aren\u2019t told why) and that this was a non-randomized, prospective clinical trial which is potentially subject to a series of biases. The key takeaway is that this evidence does not establish the superiority of this approach to any other radiotherapy, any active treatment, or active surveillance. The quote from a study author at the end of the release indicating that more research was required and this study was not definitive proof of the superiority of the 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy was a welcome caution, and somewhat at odds with the overall positive tone of the release. Promoting brachytherapy radiation for treatment of low-risk men is a form of disease-mongering, particularly since there is no mention of the surveillance option. The American Urological Association (AUA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that men with low-risk cancers be offered active surveillance. The release doesn\u2019t tell us who sponsored the study. The published report indicated there were no conflicts of interest. The release says the study compared safety and effectiveness of single high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy to longer courses of HDR treatment and that this alternative \u201cmay or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d This sounds inconclusive. Just what are the \u201chistorical standards?\u201d And why talk about \u201ccure\u201d rates? A recently published randomized trial (PROTECT, Hamdy et al. NEJM, September 2016) of active monitoring, radiotherapy, and surgery for men with localized cancer found a 99% prostate-cancer specific survival for all treatment arms through 10 years of follow up. Speaking of a \u201ccure\u201d rate for low-risk\u00a0disease that does not need to be cured is very misleading. H. Gilbert Welch, MD, MPH. professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute, has described these low risk diseases as \u201cpseudo disease.\u201d The release doesn\u2019t address availability but high dose brachytherapy has been available for years\u2013and a Google search reveals many sites offering this treatment. The news release suggests that this is a new strategy based on new research but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. According to UpToDate, an evidence-based list of practice recommendations published by Wolters Kluwer, use of single, high dose brachytherapy for prostate cancer is not novel: \u201cThe HDR brachytherapy dose is usually administered in one to four large dose fractions over a period of time, typically 24 to 40 hours. Patients receiving more than one fraction are usually admitted to the hospital (typically a 23 hour \u201coutpatient stay\u201d) for treatment when delivering multiple fractions and retain the perineal catheters in place for the entire period.\u201d The release detracts from the actual study when it states that the research \u201cillustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation\u2026\u201d \u00a0This seems unjustified in the context of the trial. Is one ever really \u2018cured\u2019 from prostate cancer?

Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family. The Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"\"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\" \"\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. \"\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\" A reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. \"\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\"\" he wrote. \"\" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. \u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019 This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of \"\"Ben Carson\"\" and \"\"Pell Grants\"\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college. \"\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\"\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"\"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson.

The story\u2019s main strength is that it provided caveats early and often about the small size and short duration of the study and the need for more rigorous trials. However, it didn\u2019t give enough information to help readers understand whether weight loss and blood pressure improvements were sufficient to reduce disease risk. The headline also oversells the findings by stating that the fasting plan is \u201clinked to weight loss and health benefits.\u201d In fact, the study found most metabolic risk factors unchanged. The story also would have been stronger had it used people-first language to help reduce stigma around obesity. There\u2019s a lot of excitement around Intermittent fasting as a strategy to lose weight and reduce risk factors for metabolic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The so-called 16:8 fasting diet is just the latest flavor. Early-phase studies like this one provide just a clue of how well they work. News reporting needs to refrain from hyperbole and focus on the many caveats around these trials.

We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week\u2019s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours.

These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun.

{"claim_id":9083,"hypothesis":"Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit","date_published":"October 6, 2017","explanation_1":"Editor\u2019s note: On the day this\u00a0 review was published, the news release it\u2019s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke.
