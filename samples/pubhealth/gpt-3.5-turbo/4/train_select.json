{"claim_id":27582,"hypothesis":"The United States is deporting military veterans.","date_published":"February 8, 2016","explanation_1":"Honorably-discharged veterans of the U.S. military have, under certain circumstances, either received deportation orders or been deported.","fact_checkers":"Brooke Binkowski","premise":"Immigration is a sensitive and touchy issue, and never more so than in the United States during an election year. Thus, when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the U.S. military living in Mexico after they had been\u00a0deported from the United States (a story we\u00a0previously reported on) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite. However, deported veterans exist, although no one \u2014 not even the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 knows how many. Their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream American consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in Tijuana. \u201cThe Bunker,\u201d also known as the Deported Veterans Support House, is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in Mexico\u2019s border town of Tijuana, and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the United States military, who fought everywhere from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Former Army paratrooper Hector Barajas, 39, opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who, like him, had been deported: \u201cI started The Bunker because there was a need,\u201d Barajas told us. He said since his deportation, he had been meeting others like him living in Tijuana, and discovered that they lived throughout Mexico\u00a0\u2014 but not just Mexico. There are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries, he said. Since then, The Bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause: Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home. We shouldn\u2019t honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for. It may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the United States military does not automatically confer citizenship, but it doesn\u2019t. It can smooth\u00a0the way, provided the aspiring\u00a0citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe. However, it\u2019s not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume (having never been told otherwise) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship, and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait. Sometimes, too, there are bureaucratic foulups. One man was deported after\u00a0he was unable to attend a hearing, despite his reason: he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time. Others do everything the way they\u2019re supposed to, filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings, but still get deported, and no one seems to know\u00a0exactly why. Once they are outside the U.S., they maintain a\u00a0legal right to VA benefits such as healthcare, and to whatever funds they might be entitled, but they have no way of getting back into the United States to obtain that assistance, and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them. Because these particular veterans are either in the United States on green cards or without documentation after their discharges, they can be deported with cause, or for no reason at all. Past and present members of the armed forces\u00a0are supposed to receive special consideration\u00a0during deportation hearings, but the\u00a0guidelines are inconsistently applied. However, some\u00a0of these veterans have\u00a0spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses, which makes their situation more difficult to parse, at least politically. Elected officials (and\u00a0candidates) who might ordinarily be in full-throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers. Sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the American flag\u00a0suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before. Miguel Perez, a United States Army veteran, falls under that category. The 39-year-old Illinois man, who served two tours in Afghanistan and who has been in the U.S. since he was eight, was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008. The green card holder had served half of a 15-year prison sentence when Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement took him for deportation proceedings. After losing an appeal, Perez was deported in March 2018: Perez was flown from Gary, Indiana, to Brownsville, Texas, where officers escorted him across the border and turned him over to Mexican authorities, ICE officials said. Perez appeared shocked by his treatment during his final moments on U.S. soil. An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would \u201cfix this\u201d while leading him to a gate, Perez said. \u201cWhen we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done here,'\u201d he said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally? This is it?\u201d The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to\u00a0return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don\u2019t apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes.

Also missing from the first-person account was information about whether the product demonstrated signs of tampering. Nair and other hair removal creams have a distinct, overpowering scent similar to sulfur, which is stronger still when it is undiluted.The New Richmond Police Department put out a press release saying they are investigating the incident:On July 28, 2019 The New Richmond Police Department received a complaint of alleged product tampering. A 21 year old female subject indicated she used hair conditioner, recently purchased, and upon using the product for the first time reported immediate significant hair loss on her head. The product was reported to have a different smell and color than the original product. Product tampering can be a felony offense and is cited under Wisconsin State Statute 941.327. Due to the significance of this offense, New Richmond officers and detectives have been working with Wal-Mart staff to identify potential suspects and review video surveillance. The New Richmond Police Department will continue to follow the facts of this case.While this appears to be an isolated case at this time, the New Richmond Police Department is asking anyone in this area that has been a recent victim of this type of activity to please report it immediately to your local police\/sheriff\u2019s department.The New Richmond Police Department is also reminding people to be diligent in checking products for safety seals and prior to any use to make sure it is consistent with the product you are expecting.Some news sites reported on the Facebook post as an isolated incident (\u201cWoman loses hair \u2018in clumps\u2019 after Nair was allegedly mixed into conditioner bought at Walmart\u201d), while others leapt to the conclusion that this was a trend:People Are Now Putting Hair Removal Creme In Shampoo BottlesSomeone had replaced the brand new product with Nair hair removal creme.I remember the rumors about people putting Nair in the conditioner and shampoo bottles of their worst enemies, but this is something entirely worse!

A mother is urging shoppers who purchase products at Walmart to double-check if any of the items have been tampered with before buying them. This after her daughter discovered her conditioner bottle contained Nair inside the product. Nair is a hair removal product that works by breaking the \u201cdisulfide bonds of the keratin molecules in hair\u201d which makes it easier for hair to be wiped away easily without using a razor.As the first of the two sites noted above, claims about contaminating conditioner with hair removal creams like Nair are old urban legends, which does not mean that someone, somewhere has not attempted to execute such a prank. Further, the post alludes to targeting a person in that fashion; as presented, the purported victim in the Facebook posts appeared to have been randomly selected.In the second excerpt, the site made reference to the manner in which Nair and other chemical depilatories function. In contrast with most conditioners (which sit on the hair for one to three minutes), Nair and hair removal creams sit on the skin for five to ten minutes \u2014 or even longer \u2014 to dissolve hair. On their website, Nair provides the following instructions for one product:Smooth on a thick, even layer to cover hair. Leave cream on for 5 minutes.Check a small area for hair removal. If your hair is thick, you may need more time. (Don\u2019t leave on longer than 10 minutes. )Gently wipe off the cream and hair with a damp washcloth. Don\u2019t rub!Rumors about contaminating conditioner (or shampoo) with Nair very likely antedate the internet. However, their plausibility was discussed on the Straight Dope message board back in 2001; forum members provided a laundry list of reasons the prank was impractical. It was cited other forums in undated posts, and appeared in 2010 on a forum for people with long hair. In an unrelated 2010 video, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d prank appeared on YouTube.In 2016, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d rumor was the subject of a viral hoax. In 2018, a Reddit user claimed a disgruntled roommate put hair removal cream in her shampoo, and that same year the likelihood of the prank working was discussed on Quora. On the latter post, a self-identified hairdresser claimed to have witnessed the aftermath of one such incident.In photographs, the woman making the claims appeared to be missing neatly bordered sections of scalp hair, not a diffuse amount throughout her scalp. Conditioner is distributed through hair, and whether strands had been shortened or unevenly dissolved was also not clear from the photographs.In the photograph on the left side of Timm\u2019s post, the conditioner is shown to be a large bottle with a pump, supposedly purchased just two days earlier. Hair removal cream surreptitiously added to the bottle in a Walmart aisle would be situated at the top and unlikely to move to the bottom of the bottle, whereas the pump would retrieve product from the bottom up. If an ill-intentioned shopper decanted hair removal cream into a very large pump bottle of conditioner, it seemed unlikely the affected product would migrate into the pump in the first day or two of use.It is also possible that the uneven distribution was due to a tampered but unshaken product, where pockets of pure \u201cNair\u201d were next to pockets of conditioner. However, massaging the product through hair ought to have diluted the \u201cNair\u201d as well, making it less efficient. Presumably, a then-diluted formula would have sat on the skin for a shorter period of time than five minutes, lowering the possibility of hairless patches.Another issue is that the articles quoted above asserted that \u201cpeople\u201d are \u201cnow putting\u201d hair removal cream in conditioner; we found no other reports of such tampering in the time period during which the reports appeared. We emailed Nair for information about the feasibility of the rumor, but have not yet received a response.In short, a woman claimed that a chemical hair remover\u00a0was added to hair conditioner she purchased at Walmart, leading to hair loss.

{"claim_id":38613,"hypothesis":" An open letter to Oxford students demanding that a statute of Oxford benefactor Cecil Rhodes be removed from campus has gone viral. ","date_published":"March 30, 2016","explanation_1":"Oxford Pushes Back Letter About Cecil Rhodes Statute ","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"No author is listed for this open letter to Oxford University students demanding the removal of a Cecil Rhodes statute, and we haven\u2019t been able to verify where it came from. The \u201cRhodes Must Fall\u201d movement gained widespread publicity in early 2016. The Cecil Rhodes statute, which has sat outside a building at Oriel College for more than 100 years, represents racism and colonialism, student activists have argued. According to a Change.org petition started by supporters of the group: We find it deplorable that Oriel College continues to glorify an international criminal through its uncritical, deeply\u00a0violent iconography. As long as the statue remains, Oriel College\u00a0and Oxford University continue to tacitly identify with\u00a0Rhodes\u2019s values, and to maintain a toxic culture of domination and oppression. We believe that the colonialism, racism\u00a0and\u00a0patriarchy this statue is seeped in has no place in our university \u2013 which for many of us is also our home. The\u00a0removal of this statue would be a welcome first step in the University\u2019s\u00a0attempt to redress the ways in which it has\u00a0been an active beneficiary of empire. While it remains standing, the statue of Rhodes remains a celebration not just of\u00a0the crimes of the\u00a0man himself, but of the imperialist legacy on which Oxford University has thrived, and continues to\u00a0thrive. While the statue remains standing, Oxford University continues to\u00a0condone the persistent racism that shadows\u00a0this institution. At issue is Cecil Rhodes\u2019 legacy of British imperialism in South Africa, where he served as prime minister of Cape Colony and enforced racial segregation. Rhodes was intent on \u201cpainting the map red\u201d (a term for British colonization) in Africa, and he even dreamed of reclaiming the American colonies for the British Empire, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. After his political career, Cecil Rhodes became the benefactor of the Rhodes Scholarships. Each year, 32 American students are selected as Rhodes Scholars for \u201ctheir character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.\u201d Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten told student demonstrators in January that Nelson Mendela had endorse the Rhodes scholarships, and that those who were not prepared to embrace freedom of though should \u201cthink about being educated elsewhere,\u201d The Guardian reports: In early February, Oxford University administrators announced that they would not remove the Rhodes statue from campus, despite concerns from student groups. After the Oxford Union backed a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes statute on January 20th, it was later revealed that the statute would remain due to pressure from donors, the Telegraph reports: \u201cI think that we are giving them [the students] the respect of listening to their views, even when we don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he told the\u00a0Today programme on BBC Radio 4. \u201cBut if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards\u00a0Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for\u00a0any undergraduate, Karl Popper\u2019s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about\u00a0being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.\u201d \u201cThat focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in American campuses and British\u00a0campuses,\u201d Patten said. \u201cOne of the points of a university \u2013 which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free\u00a0inquiry and debate \u2013 is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don\u2019t like and talk\u00a0about them and debate them.\u201d He added: \u201cCan you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people,\u00a0it\u2019s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to\u00a0talk about western values, which I regard as glob.\u201d By mid-February, administrators made clear that the Rhodes statute would not be removed. Around that same time, the \u201cOxford Pushes Back\u201d letter to student demonstrators first surfaced on a discussion board called the Daily Gripe, on February 13th. Some of Patten\u2019s quotes are included in the Oxford Pushes Back letter, but there\u2019s no indication that he actually wrote it, or that it came from the university. In the end, there\u2019s no way to tell who the original author was.

As long as the statue remains, Oriel College\u00a0and Oxford University continue to tacitly identify with\u00a0Rhodes\u2019s values, and to maintain a toxic culture of domination and oppression. We believe that the colonialism, racism\u00a0and\u00a0patriarchy this statue is seeped in has no place in our university \u2013 which for many of us is also our home. The\u00a0removal of this statue would be a welcome first step in the University\u2019s\u00a0attempt to redress the ways in which it has\u00a0been an active beneficiary of empire. While it remains standing, the statue of Rhodes remains a celebration not just of\u00a0the crimes of the\u00a0man himself, but of the imperialist legacy on which Oxford University has thrived, and continues to\u00a0thrive. While the statue remains standing, Oxford University continues to\u00a0condone the persistent racism that shadows\u00a0this institution. At issue is Cecil Rhodes\u2019 legacy of British imperialism in South Africa, where he served as prime minister of Cape Colony and enforced racial segregation. Rhodes was intent on \u201cpainting the map red\u201d (a term for British colonization) in Africa, and he even dreamed of reclaiming the American colonies for the British Empire, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. After his political career, Cecil Rhodes became the benefactor of the Rhodes Scholarships. Each year, 32 American students are selected as Rhodes Scholars for \u201ctheir character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.\u201d Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten told student demonstrators in January that Nelson Mendela had endorse the Rhodes scholarships, and that those who were not prepared to embrace freedom of though should \u201cthink about being educated elsewhere,\u201d The Guardian reports: In early February, Oxford University administrators announced that they would not remove the Rhodes statue from campus, despite concerns from student groups. After the Oxford Union backed a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes statute on January 20th, it was later revealed that the statute would remain due to pressure from donors, the Telegraph reports: \u201cI think that we are giving them [the students] the respect of listening to their views, even when we don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he told the\u00a0Today programme on BBC Radio 4. \u201cBut if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards\u00a0Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for\u00a0any undergraduate, Karl Popper\u2019s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about\u00a0being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.\u201d \u201cThat focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in American campuses and British\u00a0campuses,\u201d Patten said. \u201cOne of the points of a university \u2013 which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free\u00a0inquiry and debate \u2013 is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don\u2019t like and talk\u00a0about them and debate them.\u201d He added: \u201cCan you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people,\u00a0it\u2019s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to\u00a0talk about western values, which I regard as glob.\u201d By mid-February, administrators made clear that the Rhodes statute would not be removed. Around that same time, the \u201cOxford Pushes Back\u201d letter to student demonstrators first surfaced on a discussion board called the Daily Gripe, on February 13th. Some of Patten\u2019s quotes are included in the Oxford Pushes Back letter, but there\u2019s no indication that he actually wrote it, or that it came from the university. In the end, there\u2019s no way to tell who the original author was.

The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners.

This tale of vehicular velocity ferocity has been popular among servicemen since the late 1970s. In those early word-of-mouth versions, the JATO was taken from a cargo plane or out of a warehouse on base, thereby answering a key question left up in the air in later versions: Where did the intrepid lad obtain the engine?

As it appeared in 1995: \u201cDarwin award\u201d Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards \u2014 it\u2019s an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way.Last year\u2019s winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke(tm) machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And for this year\u2019s nominee, the story is: The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, on the outside of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The boys in the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra `push\u2019 for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the JATO!! Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between 250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve \u2026 The brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the car. TODAY\u2019S LESSON: Solid-fuel rockets don\u2019t have an \u2018off\u2019 switch \u2026 Nor, so it seems, do good stories. A spokesman of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated in a 1996 newspaper article the JATO story wasn\u2019t true though they continued to get asked about it. \u201cWe get a call on that about every 90 days,\u201d said Dave Myers. \u201cIt keeps us on the map.\u201d There are two fatal problems with the JATO story. First, anybody who understood the extreme forces involved well enough to attach a JATO unit to a car so that it would keep the car going in a straight line (rather than immediately spinning around) would probably know better than to do it in the first place. Second, the Arizona Highway Patrol has a phone number. A call to them will confirm they\u2019ve both heard the story and no, it\u2019s not true. Sorry, fellas. Though the legend of the smoldering Chevy smashed into a cliff face is pure fabrication, JATO engines have been mounted on cars on a couple of occasions. As reported in Motor Trend in 1957, Dodge took a brand-new car out to El Mirage dry lake bed in California, removed the gas tank, and mounted a JATO unit in its place.

As it appeared in 1995: \u201cDarwin award\u201d Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards \u2014 it\u2019s an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way.Last year\u2019s winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke(tm) machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And for this year\u2019s nominee, the story is: The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, on the outside of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The boys in the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra `push\u2019 for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the JATO!! Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between 250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve \u2026 The brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the car. TODAY\u2019S LESSON: Solid-fuel rockets don\u2019t have an \u2018off\u2019 switch \u2026 Nor, so it seems, do good stories. A spokesman of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated in a 1996 newspaper article the JATO story wasn\u2019t true though they continued to get asked about it. \u201cWe get a call on that about every 90 days,\u201d said Dave Myers. \u201cIt keeps us on the map.\u201d There are two fatal problems with the JATO story. First, anybody who understood the extreme forces involved well enough to attach a JATO unit to a car so that it would keep the car going in a straight line (rather than immediately spinning around) would probably know better than to do it in the first place. Second, the Arizona Highway Patrol has a phone number. A call to them will confirm they\u2019ve both heard the story and no, it\u2019s not true. Sorry, fellas. Though the legend of the smoldering Chevy smashed into a cliff face is pure fabrication, JATO engines have been mounted on cars on a couple of occasions. As reported in Motor Trend in 1957, Dodge took a brand-new car out to El Mirage dry lake bed in California, removed the gas tank, and mounted a JATO unit in its place. (The intent was to test the car\u2019s brakes and to film the event for TV commercials.) The car went 140 mph. Flynn, Mike. The Best Book of Bizarre But True Stories Ever. London: Carlton, 1999.

Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans.

Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster.\"\" The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words.

Hands off our bodies. And our laws.\"\" The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that \"\"Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands\"\" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: \"\"SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990).\"\" So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, \"\"creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.\"\" Florida law currently allows married couples to\u00a0divorce if a court finds that the marriage is \"\"irretrievably broken.\"\" It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary \"\"covenant marriage.\"\" Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:  \"\"I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.\"\" The covenant marriage agreement \"\"may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery,\"\" according to the bill Webster filed. \"\"A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted,\"\" HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that \"\"no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife,\"\" but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the \"\"original\"\" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was \"\"significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,\"\" Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad \"\"Taliban Dan Webster,\"\" Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce.

Eugene Emery Jr.","premise":"\"Former Vice President Al Gore, now a crusader against climate change, argues that the continued release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is going to do more than just raise temperatures. It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process \"\"disrupts ocean chemistry,\"\" he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, \"\"but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years.\"\" That's important, he said, because, \"\"This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now.\"\" On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently \"\"much more acidic\"\" than it has been for \"\"many millions of years?\"\" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse\u2019s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: \"\"Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years.\"\" That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back \"\"many millions of years\"\" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that \"\"the uncertainty in the data points is very large.\"\" She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. \"\"If you go back 4 million years, you're there,\"\" Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. \"\"The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now.\"\" Again, that's not \"\"many millions of years.\"\" Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, \"\"Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today,\"\" he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off. It would have been more accurate to say, said Honisch, \"\"The ocean is acidifying faster today than it has in millions of years.\"\" Our ruling Former Vice President Al Gore said the ocean today \"\"is much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years.\"\" It's clear that the ocean is more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution.
