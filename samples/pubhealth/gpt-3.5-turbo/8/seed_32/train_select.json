Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\" We won\u2019t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, \u00a0healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these \"\"major\"\" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. If all regulations were counted, Obama\u2019s record would be nowhere near Portman\u2019s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. But Portman said \"\"major\"\" rules.\"\" \"\"Major\"\" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them \"\"economically significant\"\" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to \"\"major\"\" that there is no need to split hairs here. We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. One was provided by Portman\u2019s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. Portman\u2019s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama\u2019s tenure with the first three of Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president\u2019s term. Portman\u2019s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. A similar analysis by George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman\u2019s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama\u2019s first term. This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman\u2019s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"\"major\"\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term.

They are calling for action to reduce BPA exposure, especially among vulnerable groups like babies and pregnant women. The evidence also shows that some European countries have already taken unilateral action on BPA, and experts estimate that BPA is detectable in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. and European population. Therefore, the claim that experts are demanding European action on the plastics chemical is true based on the evidence provided."}

Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church\u2019s 9 a.m. Mass\u2026 \u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Morey told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey added. Asked by Snopes to confirm, deny, or clarify Morey\u2019s account, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment on the story. Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":7484,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights.

They are all showing improvement. We were unable to turn up any substantiated complaints of renal failure in cats attributed to (or deemed likely caused by) Temptations treats. On 3 March 2016, Temptations responded to our query, noting that the pet snacks were manufactured in Canada (not China, as many Facebook users speculated) and thus subject to stringent oversight: Thank you for the message.n\nClaim: Temptations cat treats are causing renal failure in cats.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Not enough information.\n\nThere is no concrete evidence or substantiated complaints of renal failure in cats caused by Temptations cat treats. Anecdotal reports and rumors were circulating, but nothing was definitively proven. Additionally, the company behind Temptations stated that their treats undergo quality checks and are subject to stringent oversight. Therefore, without any verified cases, it is not possible to confirm the claim as true, false, or partially true and false."}
{"claim_id":34678,"hypothesis":"The red dye commonly used in nectar for backyard feeders is harmful to hummingbirds.","date_published":"September 12, 2003","explanation_1":"Some bird lovers fear the presence of their nectar dispensers will tempt the little birds to delay migration, causing coddled hummers to become trapped by the sudden onset of cold weather. Yet they need not so fearful, because the hummingbird\u2019s instinct to migrate is too strong to be sidetracked. When it\u2019s time to go, they know.","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"In the 1970s DDT, a highly effective pesticide then widely in use in the U.S., was believed to be threatening the continuation of a number of bird species. Reports claimed that bald eagles, ospreys, and peregrine falcons exposed to the chemical laid eggs with abnormally thin shells which broke during incubation and resulted in markedly fewer successful hatchings, so new generations were not surviving to replace earlier ones as older birds died off. Because of this looming extinction threat, DDT was subjected to a domestic ban in 1972. Once the pesticide was removed from the environment, the population levels of the endangered birds returned to near their previous levels. (Later studies indicated that factors other than DDT use were likely responsible for most of the decline.) Half-remembered fragments of the many news stories about the effects of DDT on those threatened raptors may have contributed to a related widespread conviction regarding hummingbirds \u2014 that the red dye commonly added to the nectar used in hummingbird feeders works to thin the shells of their eggs, placing them in similar jeopardy: Examples: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] This morning I got a stern lecture from the checkout lady at the grocery store because I was buying red food coloring to use in a hummingbird feeder. \u201cDon\u2019t you know red food coloring weakens their egg shells?\u201d she demanded. [Collected via e-mail, 2001] I have heard that the use of red dye in Humming Bird feeders will wipe out the family of the birds using the feeder in three generations. The dye is surposed to weaken the eggs. Or the suspicion could have been fueled by a more general wariness attached to red dyes, especially in the wake of the longstanding controversy over Red Dye #3, a colorant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned for a number of uses of in 1990 after it was linked to the development of thyroid tumors in male rats. (Red Dye #2 has been banned by the FDA since 1976.) For whatever reason, many folks have come to suspect the color additive in hummingbird nectar poses a danger to the little creatures, with the \u201cIt thins the shells of their eggs\u201d belief heard most often as the specific harm wrought by the coloring. Others reasons claimed for avoiding red dye include a fear the substance will build up in hummingbirds\u2019 kidneys or livers, or that new hatchlings whose mothers partook of the sweet will be born blind or deformed. The red dye traditionally added to attract hummers to nectar dispensers may never have been necessary anyway. While it is true hummingbirds are drawn to red, there is more than one way to entice a bird. According to an entry found in the Audubon Society\u2019s FAQ: Current thinking is that the red dye may not be good for them, nor is it necessary to attract hummingbirds. The color on your feeder is enough to attract them. You can mix your own nectar using 1\/4 cup sugar to every 1 cup of water. The Audubon Society\u2019s page does not detail the harm it fears dye could potentially cause. We\u2019re unaware of any definitive study either linking the colorant to a particular illness in hummingbirds or demonstrating it to be harmless. Anecdotal evidence postulates a causal connection with beak and liver tumors. Rather than take a chance with the little birds\u2019 health, many bird fanciers have chosen to omit red dye from the liquid feed they offer their airborne visitors. A mixture of 1 cup of sugar to 4 cups of water makes a perfectly serviceable nectar. (Do not use honey in place of sugar, because it can promote the growth of a fungus that kills hummers.) Dye is unnecessary in the mix because the birds are already attracted to the red coloring of the feeders themselves. But do keep those feeders clean, because the sugar\/water mix can ferment fairly quickly in the summer sun, making it bad for the very wildlife it\u2019s meant to energize. The feeding of hummingbirds has attracted a second rumor, one of a more sinister nature: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] I heard that a man was recently arrested for cruelty to animals after starving a number of humming birds by putting out feeders with nutra-sweet in them. We haven\u2019t found a news account or other report of any such incident. Moreover, hummingbirds generally draw their sustenance from spiders, flies, gnats, and other insects they eat, not from the sweet nectar they sip.

Further, of the doctors responding to the survey, 42 percent said they weren\u2019t participating in marketplace plans because they were never asked to, not because they were \"\"opting out.\"\" The estimate is the result of a flawed methodology and a misreading of survey data.\"","fact_checkers":"Steve Contorno","premise":"\"Are doctors en masse refusing patients who gained health care coverage due to the Affordable Care Act? That\u2019s the claim\u00a0in a chain email a reader asked us to check. \"\"More, truly scary Obamacare news,\"\" said the email, sent just before Halloween. The \u00a0accompanying story was from CNSnews.com, a site operated by the conservative Media Research Center. \"\"Over 214,000 Doctors Opt Out of Obamacare Exchanges,\"\" read a headline on CNSnews.com. We found the source of the claim. It was coming from American Action Forum, a self-described \"\"center-right policy institute.\"\" The organization put out an analysis on Oct. 27 titled: \"\"Health Care Providers are Opting-Out of Obamacare Exchange Plans.\"\" How many? According to the post, \"\"as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products.\"\" It went on to list some reasons \"\"doctors are opting out of the exchange plans.\"\" That\u2019s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive.

To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them.

That\u2019s the claim\u00a0in a chain email a reader asked us to check. \"\"More, truly scary Obamacare news,\"\" said the email, sent just before Halloween. The \u00a0accompanying story was from CNSnews.com, a site operated by the conservative Media Research Center. \"\"Over 214,000 Doctors Opt Out of Obamacare Exchanges,\"\" read a headline on CNSnews.com. We found the source of the claim. It was coming from American Action Forum, a self-described \"\"center-right policy institute.\"\" The organization put out an analysis on Oct. 27 titled: \"\"Health Care Providers are Opting-Out of Obamacare Exchange Plans.\"\" How many? According to the post, \"\"as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products.\"\" It went on to list some reasons \"\"doctors are opting out of the exchange plans.\"\" That\u2019s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago\u2019s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. \"\"Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft,\"\" he said. \"\"Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return,\"\" he said, later adding, \"\"It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws,\"\" the verdict means \"\"it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance.\"\" In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is \"\"one way\"\" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert\u2019s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich \"\"is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law.\"\" The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one\u2019s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person \"\"reasonably believes\"\" such force is necessary to prevent imminent \"\"theft during the nighttime\"\" or \"\"criminal mischief during the nighttime.\"\" Jurors concluded that the \"\"theft\"\" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. \"\"She was committing a scam,\"\" he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn\u2019t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. \"\"It is not open season on prostitutes\"\" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. \"\"This has gone, as you know, viral with \u2018It\u2019s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,\u2019 \u2018Stupid Texans and their guns,\u2019 \"\" he said. \"\"Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted.\"\" As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, \"\"You cannot under any circumstances do so.\"\" University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, \"\"Reich, in my view, is simply wrong.\"\" Frago and Gilbert\u2019s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. \"\"What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money,\"\" he said. \"\"In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than \u2018just\u2019 a contractual dispute,\"\" Dix said. \"\"It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid.\"\" Even so, he said, \"\"The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft.\"\" That\u2019s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich\u2019s assertion, the jury didn\u2019t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force. Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it\u2019s not a \"\"public nuisance\"\" in Texas law. It\u2019s classified under \"\"public indecency\"\" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich\u2019s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: \"\"Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief,\"\" Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person\u2019s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. \"\"It\u2019s a ridiculous statement.\"\" Dix said, \"\"I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can \u2018shoot someone who\u2019s committing a \"\"public nuisance\"\" under the cover of dark.\u2019 It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage.\"\" Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified \"\"during the nighttime.\"\" Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because \"\"sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless.\"\" Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, \"\"it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 under the cover of dark,\"\" claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it\u2019s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance.

A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It\u2019s another thing to say what state Rep. William \"\"Billy\"\" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically \"\"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are the \"\"most polluted\"\" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. \"\"There are so many things that \u2018pollute\u2019 our rivers \u2014 GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,\"\" Raabe said. \"\"The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity.\"\" Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. \"\"The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,\"\" Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn\u2019t have a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) \"\"does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,\"\" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with \u2013 including the\u00a0Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA \u2013\u00a0echoed Raabe in saying it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina\u00a0Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. \"\"Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends,\"\" Marraccini wrote in an email.

Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term.

{"claim_id":10255,"hypothesis":"Study Finds Single, Escalated Dose of Brachytherapy Radiation May Be a Safe and Effective Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer","date_published":"March 3, 2017","explanation_1":"This news release from a professional society of radiation oncologists summarizes a trial in 58 men with Stage 1 localized prostate cancer that found using a single treatment of\u00a0high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (where radioactive implants are inserted directly into the tissue) may be an acceptable and safe alternative to typical longer, but lower doses of radiation. Recognizing\u00a0that a higher dose, single radiation treatment could be more toxic to tissues surrounding the prostate, this trial set out to measure the effectiveness and safety of such treatment. While the research was non-randomized, its generally positive tone was balanced by\u00a0emphasizing that there needs to be additional follow-up research to see how it compares with conventional approaches. After stating in the headline the treatment \u201cmay be safe and effective,\u201d the release provides a fairly detailed description of harms. A concern with this study is that nearly all of the patient volunteers would have been candidates for active surveillance\u2013meaning that they did not need an active treatment. With no caveat that expert guidelines recommend surveillance for low-risk Stage 1 prostate cancers, this release engages in disease-mongering. It is recognized that exposure to radioactive treatments can be harmful and so finding other ways to treat tumors in the prostate should be welcomed. If a treatment for localized prostate cancer which is\u00a0administered in a single procedure, is equally effective and safe as conventional treatment, it is possible that patients may have fewer side effects and adverse events related to their prostate cancer treatment. This\u00a0study provides some\u00a0data on the safety and tolerability of the single dose of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy compared to\u00a0LDR brachytherapy, \u00a0It is important to note that these patients were a very select sample of prostate cancer patients (low to intermediate risk) and so extrapolating those findings to other prostate cancer patients may not be appropriate.","fact_checkers":"Alan Cassels,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"There was zero mention of cost, which is unfortunate because presumably a single treatment would entail fewer costs than one that involved multiple procedures. The main benefit focused on a vaguely described \u201cbiochemical progression,\u201d which means that there was some evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Determining PSA progression is more complicated following radiation because it takes time for the PSA level to stabilize (unlike following surgery to remove the prostate) before you can determine whether the PSA is rising. Biochemical progression is also a surrogate measure and does not imply that the cancer is\u2013or will\u2013clinically progress. The researchers did acknowledge that the actual benefits are unknown, saying that \u201cas the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d The release provided detailed information on harms: \u201cWithin the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency\/urgency (6.9%).

The practice of purposely elongating skulls is well known to anthropologists, and while academics may debate the motivation certain societies had for doing it, there is no scientific debate over whether\u00a0those societies were human.","fact_checkers":"Bethania Palma","premise":"A story has been circulating around alien and UFO conspiracy web sites since 2014, alluding that DNA tests done on cone-shaped skulls found in the Paracas region of Peru show they are of extraterrestrial origin. The strange appearance of the skulls coupled with the outlandish claim continues to give the story legs, and it continues to make the rounds as of mid-January 2017: The director of the Paracas Museum of History sent five samples of the Paracas skulls to undergo genetic testing, and the results were mesmerizing. The samples which consisted of hair, skin teeth and some fragments of cranial bones gave incredible details that have fueled the mystery surrounding these anomalous skulls. The genetic laboratory to where the samples were sent was not informed of the origin of the skulls in order to avoid \u2018influenced results.\u2019 Interestingly, the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, showed mutations that were unknown to any man, primate or animal found on planet Earth. The mutations present in the samples of the Paracas skulls suggest that researchers were dealing with a completely new \u2018human-like being,\u2019 very different from Homo sapiens, Neanderthals or Denisovans. The announcement in 2014 that the skulls had non-human DNA was originally promoted by Brien Foerster, a figure known for pseudoscience. As RationalWiki notes: Foerster has little in the way of relevant scientific qualifications but runs a tour company and was a regular on the very unscientific History Channel show Ancient Aliens, the museum is a private company owned by a man with no scientific qualifications, not an academic institution, and the results were announced not in a peer reviewed journal but on Facebook.

The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women. This is not the first time a discovery of human remains with elongated skulls sparked the hopes of UFO enthusiasts. A 2015 discovery of a prehistoric woman in Russia, at a site known as Arkaim or \u201cRussia\u2019s Stonehenge,\u201d with a similar deformity also created a buzz: Some believe that the skull\u2019s high forehead is characteristic of the so-called \u201calien grey\u201d often depicted as large-eyed and large-foreheaded beings in sci-fi films and even hoaxes. Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to.

The strange appearance of the skulls coupled with the outlandish claim continues to give the story legs, and it continues to make the rounds as of mid-January 2017: The director of the Paracas Museum of History sent five samples of the Paracas skulls to undergo genetic testing, and the results were mesmerizing. The samples which consisted of hair, skin teeth and some fragments of cranial bones gave incredible details that have fueled the mystery surrounding these anomalous skulls. The genetic laboratory to where the samples were sent was not informed of the origin of the skulls in order to avoid \u2018influenced results.\u2019 Interestingly, the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, showed mutations that were unknown to any man, primate or animal found on planet Earth. The mutations present in the samples of the Paracas skulls suggest that researchers were dealing with a completely new \u2018human-like being,\u2019 very different from Homo sapiens, Neanderthals or Denisovans. The announcement in 2014 that the skulls had non-human DNA was originally promoted by Brien Foerster, a figure known for pseudoscience. As RationalWiki notes: Foerster has little in the way of relevant scientific qualifications but runs a tour company and was a regular on the very unscientific History Channel show Ancient Aliens, the museum is a private company owned by a man with no scientific qualifications, not an academic institution, and the results were announced not in a peer reviewed journal but on Facebook.

It was against that backdrop that Dr. Patrick Johnston, the director of Personhood Ohio and a \u00a0leader of the effort to get the so-called \"\"Personhood\"\" issue on the Ohio ballot, began his remarks on Cleveland public radio on Jan. 30 with a statement. At the outset of his remarks, Johnston referred to abortion as \"\"the most common surgery in our country.\"\" The statement became the launching point for the Zanesville-area doctor to make his case that abortions have become too routine and for why Ohioans should back a rewriting of the Ohio Constitution so that a fertilized egg is defined as a person -- a change that effectively would outlaw abortion. Johnston\u2019s claim seemed like the kind of straightforward assertion that Politifact Ohio can dig into while steering clear of the moral questions that surround the divisive issue. We began by checking with Johnston to see where he got his numbers on abortion, and the frequency of other procedures. He directed us to the website for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, as the source for his abortion numbers\u2014they count about 1.21 million abortions in 2008. He also pointed us to several websites for gall bladder surgery, which assert that the procedure is one of the most common surgeries in the United States with about 500,000 patients a year. The Guttmacher Institute numbers for abortions were much higher than those we found from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported about 828,000 abortions in 2007. However, the CDC numbers are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions done in California, Maryland and New Hampshire \u2014 three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary. Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman with the Guttmacher Institute, said her group\u2019s numbers include all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports. Over the past several years, the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s estimated number of abortions in the United States have basically held steady going from 1,206,200 in 2005 to 1,212,350 in 2008. But are there more common forms of surgery? The federal CDC keeps close tabs on what people are discharged from hospitals for based on a pair of national annual surveys, one for inpatient and one for outpatient clients. By far, the most common form of surgery in 2006 was eye surgery for cataracts. There were about 5.63 million eye surgeries that involved either removing or replacing the eye lens, according to the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (the latest outpatient survey available). There were about 1.4 million endoscopic polypectomies, which involves the removal of presumed pre-cancerous lesions such as polyps on the colon, according to the outpatient numbers. Meanwhile, there were about 1.34 million Caesarean sections where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman\u2019s abdomen, according to the 2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey (the latest inpatient survey available). Abortion would rank fourth behind that trio in most common surgeries. But are they all examples of surgery or could they be considered just medical procedures? We spoke with Dr. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, and she said that while the term surgery isn\u2019t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered \"\"surgery.\"\" Keder said that eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries. Additionally, we should note here that because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures -- almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 in the United States -- that virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was much more common than abortions. There were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list.

Such an abortion would be\u00a0a purely hypothetical scenario; doctors said such a procedure doesn't make sense medically.\"","fact_checkers":"Linda Qiu","premise":"\"Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who\u2019s known for his strong anti-abortion views, said Hillary Clinton is the extremist when it comes abortion, not him. \"\"Why doesn\u2019t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child,\"\" he said during the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire. Is it true that Clinton \"\"believes all abortions should be legal even on the due date\"\"? The Rubio campaign didn\u2019t get back to us. So we looked at comments Clinton made on the issue over the past 15 years. Clinton has said she could support restrictions on abortions in the third trimester (about week 28 of a pregnancy) if the mother\u2019s life and health are taken into account. Rubio casts this position as the equivalent of supporting abortions on the due date, but that exaggerates Clinton\u2019s position. Restricting late-term abortions Clinton responded to Rubio\u2019s attack the morning after the debate, calling it \"\"pretty pathetic.\"\" \"\"I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account,\"\" she said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \"\"And, you know, when he raises the very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons.\"\" We found many instances of Clinton saying abortion should be \"\"safe, legal and rare.\"\" In short, Clinton is open to restrictions on late-term abortions provided there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother. This includes both mental health\u00a0and medical complications like preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of high blood pressure that could lead to death. We should note that those who want a total abortion ban \u2014 a position that Rubio has expressed \u2014 see exceptions made for rape, incest and health as loopholes that undermine late-term restrictions. Advocating for exceptions could theoretically encompass a due-date abortion, but Rubio\u2019s conclusion that Clinton supports due-date abortions is not backed by evidence and logically unsound. Here\u2019s a sampling of comments Clinton's made in the past: Sept. 28, 2015,\u00a0Meet the Press Daily: \"\"There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.\"\" June 4, 2007,\u00a0Democratic presidential forum: \"\"What I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare.

I\u2019ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it\u2019s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman\u2019s choice.\"\" When abortions can be performed According to the reproductive health nonprofit, the Guttmacher Institute, 20 states limit abortions after \"\"viability\"\" (which refers to the point when a fetus can survive out of the womb) and 23 states prohibit abortions between 20 and 28 weeks. Seven states and Washington D.C., have no time restrictions, but this doesn\u2019t mean late-term abortions are common. In fact, only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute. \"\"People say we should place legal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester.

Marco Rubio of Florida, who\u2019s known for his strong anti-abortion views, said Hillary Clinton is the extremist when it comes abortion, not him. \"\"Why doesn\u2019t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child,\"\" he said during the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire. Is it true that Clinton \"\"believes all abortions should be legal even on the due date\"\"? The Rubio campaign didn\u2019t get back to us. So we looked at comments Clinton made on the issue over the past 15 years. Clinton has said she could support restrictions on abortions in the third trimester (about week 28 of a pregnancy) if the mother\u2019s life and health are taken into account. Rubio casts this position as the equivalent of supporting abortions on the due date, but that exaggerates Clinton\u2019s position. Restricting late-term abortions Clinton responded to Rubio\u2019s attack the morning after the debate, calling it \"\"pretty pathetic.\"\" \"\"I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account,\"\" she said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \"\"And, you know, when he raises the very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons.\"\" We found many instances of Clinton saying abortion should be \"\"safe, legal and rare.\"\" In short, Clinton is open to restrictions on late-term abortions provided there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother.

Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family. The Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"\"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\" \"\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. \"\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\" A reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. \"\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\"\" he wrote. \"\" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. \u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019 This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of \"\"Ben Carson\"\" and \"\"Pell Grants\"\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college. \"\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\"\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"\"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson\u2019s \"\"family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,\"\" but didn\u2019t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson\u2019s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson\u2019s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson\u2019s past and his plans if elected president.

It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson\u2019s \"\"family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,\"\" but didn\u2019t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson\u2019s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson\u2019s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson\u2019s past and his plans if elected president. Carson has said he wants to eliminate government dependency, but he also has made clear he intends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them. Carson hasn\u2019t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated. Overall, the meme is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.\"n\nClaim: Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim is partially true and false. The evidence shows that Ben Carson did grow up in public schools, got public housing, food stamps, free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and likely received financial assistance for college. However, it is not clear if he specifically received Pell Grants for college, as that detail is unproven. Additionally, while Carson has expressed a desire to eliminate government dependency, he has also stated that he wants to maintain public safety nets for those who need them. Therefore, the claim is partially true in terms of Carson's background, but false in suggesting that he wants to eliminate all government assistance programs without consideration for those in need."}

The headline also oversells the findings by stating that the fasting plan is \u201clinked to weight loss and health benefits.\u201d In fact, the study found most metabolic risk factors unchanged. The story also would have been stronger had it used people-first language to help reduce stigma around obesity. There\u2019s a lot of excitement around Intermittent fasting as a strategy to lose weight and reduce risk factors for metabolic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The so-called 16:8 fasting diet is just the latest flavor. Early-phase studies like this one provide just a clue of how well they work.

We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke.

Options that include medications should include consultation with one\u2019s doctor to weigh the risks and benefits of using smoking cessation aids during pregnancy. Although the release notes that this experiment took place within the confines of an \u201cestablished\u201d text messaging program (Text4baby), the availability of the \u201cQuit4baby\u201d sub-program, which is the focus of the research, is not clear. The release notes that very little is available to assist pregnant women with smoking cessation, so a new intervention is noteworthy. The original research article references a small number of pilot studies of attempts to use social media and text messaging to convince pregnant women to stop smoking. The main message of the release is misleading if not deceptive. However, we\u2019ve already addressed that issue and see no other unjustified statements that would merit a Not Satisfactory rating here.n\nClaim: Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that a text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit is partially true and false. The evidence provided indicates that while there were some statistically significant reduction in smoking rates among smaller subgroups of the study, the overall reduction in smoking rates was not statistically significant. Additionally, the headline and lead sentence of the release were misleading as they did not accurately reflect the lack of statistical significance in the overall results. Therefore, while there may be some benefit to the text messaging program, the claim is not entirely true due to the lack of statistical significance in the overall results."}

The mask design was lab tested to ensure safety and effectiveness. **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained a page, \u201cN95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks),\u201d defining the terms used during discussions of PPE shortages; linked on that page was a March 11 2020 letter from the FDA about coping with PPE shortages in a clinical environment:N95 respirators and surgical masks (face masks) are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated? Including the school lunches they are delivering?? Doesnt the virus live on things for a period of time? Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks. If you know how to sew, have a sewing machine, and are up for that challenge, here\u2019s how you can help:Pick up a kit that will include all the materials you need to make 100 masks. We\u2019ll offer various pick-up and drop-off times and locations. The first date and location for picking up a kit is [listed. ]Be sure to check back for future kit distribution dates and locations as we will be updating regularly.A contact form providing the organizers of the 100 Million Mask Challenge with information for volunteers followed; filling out the form did not lead to any additional information on the kits\u2019 contents or parameters.Organizing the 100 Million Mask Challenge appeared to be\u00a0Providence.org, described on the site\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page as \u201cthe largest health care provider in Washington state\u201d:Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state. Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.","sources":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/blog.providence.org\/coronavirus\/volunteers-making-homemade-masks-to-combat-shortages-caused-by-covid-19, https:\/\/www.providence.org\/lp\/100m-masks, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control\/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/infection-control\/control-recommendations.html, https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/coronavirus-interview-larry-brilliant-smallpox-epidemiologist\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27100+Million+Masks%27+--+Are+Homemade+Masks+Sufficient+for+COVID-19+First+Responders%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/face-masks.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/respirators-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/rapunzel-was-quarantined-in-tangled-google-the-name-of-her-kingdom\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-deaconess-ask-public-provide-medical-face-masks\/2865273001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/20\/coronvavirus-whole-world-responding-deaconess-face-masks-plea\/2884671001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/letters-health-care-providers\/surgical-mask-and-gown-conservation-strategies-letter-healthcare-providers, https:\/\/washington.providence.org\/about, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/natural-news-cdc-coronavirus\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeaconessHealthSystem\/posts\/10156622869747273?__cft__[0]=AZWNrouqxgFJbXaeggpz4E2RA8iOBJtkFvtemEZn4bq-hM2QI5K2E1IGUqrrCs9LhNGBN4mRzgLOh-OIyGFpI5jhdP3Xhm_rsPbfe4vOnKuYENNBdpfy3BUEB_8nnGrPF_gd1XN4qgLtXa8KhvV2sujUIxfHi1WLv3VEwkav9wASkA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1012,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn March 20 2020, KOMO anchor Mary Nam shared a photograph of a person wearing a surgical mask (a form of personal protective equipment, or PPE, known to be in short supply due the coronavirus pandemic), and put out a call for anyone who knows how to sew and has access to a sewing machine to participate in an effort to fortify COVID-19 medical supplies with homemade surgical masks:Know how to sew?

The mask design was lab tested to ensure safety and effectiveness. **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained a page, \u201cN95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks),\u201d defining the terms used during discussions of PPE shortages; linked on that page was a March 11 2020 letter from the FDA about coping with PPE shortages in a clinical environment:N95 respirators and surgical masks (face masks) are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated? Including the school lunches they are delivering?? Doesnt the virus live on things for a period of time? Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks. If you know how to sew, have a sewing machine, and are up for that challenge, here\u2019s how you can help:Pick up a kit that will include all the materials you need to make 100 masks. We\u2019ll offer various pick-up and drop-off times and locations. The first date and location for picking up a kit is [listed. ]Be sure to check back for future kit distribution dates and locations as we will be updating regularly.A contact form providing the organizers of the 100 Million Mask Challenge with information for volunteers followed; filling out the form did not lead to any additional information on the kits\u2019 contents or parameters.Organizing the 100 Million Mask Challenge appeared to be\u00a0Providence.org, described on the site\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page as \u201cthe largest health care provider in Washington state\u201d:Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state. Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible.

{"claim_id":34833,"hypothesis":"A November 2019 Trump administration proposal would end Social Security disability payments for thousands of recipients.","date_published":"December 18, 2019","explanation_1":"\"What's true: According to the logic of the administration's own proposals, the changes to how \"\"continuing disability reviews\"\" take place would indeed lead to thousands of recipients losing Social Security disability benefits. What's false: That loss of benefits would not be arbitrary, and the criteria and standards used to determine a recipient's eligibility for disability benefits would not change. Rather, the frequency of eligibility reviews would increase, thus discovering ineligibility sooner and more frequently.\"","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits. On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands. '\u201d That story reported: \u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows: In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:  The administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. So the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner. A considerable measure of truth, therefore, exists in the reports published by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Common Dreams.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":2501,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits. On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands. '\u201d That story reported: \u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows: In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:  The administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. So the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner.

The proposal would add a new medical diary category called \"Medical Improvement Likely\" which would result in an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This increased scrutiny and enforcement of eligibility criteria could ultimately lead to some recipients no longer qualifying for disability benefits, resulting in thousands potentially losing their benefits. Therefore, while the claim may be partially true in terms of the potential impact of the proposal on disability payments recipients, it is false in the sense that the proposal does not directly end disability payments for thousands."}
