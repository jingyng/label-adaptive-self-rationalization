(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) However, in this case, it is accurate. Africans in at least one Chinese city are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to COVID-19 fears. Numerous legitimate news reports describe such targeted evictions, stemming from fears of another COVID-19 outbreak, in the southern China city of Guangzhou. Home to many Africans, Guangzhou has long been one of China\u2019s main commercial and trading centers. One report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as \"\"Little Africa\"\" are being forced to remain inside their apartments \u2014 even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine \u2014 and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to Al Jazeera. President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. But China has denied racism in the effort. But the actions are widespread enough, according to the Associated Press, that African officials are confronting China over racist treatment of Africans, including Africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe said: \"\"It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents. China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\"\" The Guangdong provincial government has responded to concerns about discrimination by calling China and Africa good friends, partners and brothers, according to the BBC. More than two dozen Africans told CNN about being left without a home, being subject to random testing for COVID-19, or being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Photos and videos posted on social media showed Africans sleeping on sidewalks or waiting under shop awnings after being ordered out of their apartments and hotel rooms, the Washington Post reported. And community leaders told the BBC that hundreds of Africans had been evicted after online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among African people. A video shared on Facebook claims that \"\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold.\"\" Numerous news articles report that, amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, China has focused on foreigners as a possible source of the virus, and Africans in the southern China city of Guangzhou are being evicted from their homes.

Home to many Africans, Guangzhou has long been one of China\u2019s main commercial and trading centers. One report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as \"\"Little Africa\"\" are being forced to remain inside their apartments \u2014 even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine \u2014 and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to Al Jazeera. President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. But China has denied racism in the effort. But the actions are widespread enough, according to the Associated Press, that African officials are confronting China over racist treatment of Africans, including Africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe said: \"\"It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents. China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\"\" The Guangdong provincial government has responded to concerns about discrimination by calling China and Africa good friends, partners and brothers, according to the BBC. More than two dozen Africans told CNN about being left without a home, being subject to random testing for COVID-19, or being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Photos and videos posted on social media showed Africans sleeping on sidewalks or waiting under shop awnings after being ordered out of their apartments and hotel rooms, the Washington Post reported. And community leaders told the BBC that hundreds of Africans had been evicted after online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among African people. A video shared on Facebook claims that \"\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold.\"\" Numerous news articles report that, amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, China has focused on foreigners as a possible source of the virus, and Africans in the southern China city of Guangzhou are being evicted from their homes. African leaders have called out the evictions as racist.\"n\nClaim: \u201cAfricans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold\u201d as \u201cChinese nationals blame them for the rising number of new coronavirus cases in the country.\u201d\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"True. The evidence provided clearly shows that Africans in China, particularly in Guangzhou, are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to COVID-19 fears. There are numerous legitimate news reports, eye-witness accounts, and social media posts confirming that Africans are being forced to sleep outside in the cold due to fears of a second wave of the coronavirus. Therefore, the claim that Africans in China are being forced to sleep outside is true based on the evidence provided."}

Both totals exceeded one-day records from just a day earlier. Despite the grim figures, Cuomo said overall trends still appeared positive. Cuomo cited a drop in new hospitalizations and other data as evidence that New York\u2019s social-distancing restrictions were \u201cbending the curve,\u201d helping to gain some control over the infection rate. New York is one of 42 states where governors have issued \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders and closed all non-essential workplaces. While public health experts say such measures are vital for controlling the contagion, the restrictions have strangled the U.S. economy, leading to widespread layoffs, upheavals on Wall Street and projections of a severe recession. Cuomo said the loss of life would likely continue at current levels or increase in days ahead as critically ill patients die after prolonged bouts hooked up to ventilators. U.S. deaths due to coronavirus topped 14,700 on Wednesday, the second highest reported number in the world behind Italy, according to a Reuters tally. New York state accounts for over a third of the U.S. total.

We can, however, dismiss some of the more fanciful \u201cexplanations\u201d that have come along: We can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above. First, wives and girlfriends (i.e., prostitutes) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time. Can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships, and how many extra rations they\u2019d have had to carry, if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along? And where did these women stay? There was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew (even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once), and women couldn\u2019t be out on deck where they\u2019d interfere with the operation of the ship. Were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time? Yes, some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives, but this happened infrequently at best, making the presence of non-passenger females (pregnant or otherwise) aboard sailing ships unusual. The vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard, thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women\u2019s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed. (Larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck. This is where the crew on such ships would sleep, not amidst the guns on the gun deck.) Second, we should look askance at the claim that when in port, and with the crew restricted to the ship, women typically gave birth aboard ship. Crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports, which we can fairly assume their home berths were not. And even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew (either to desertion or drunkenness) if they were let off the ship, the wives were under no such restrictions. Not being necessary to the running of the ship, nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth. Their husbands not only wouldn\u2019t accompany this hypothetical exodus, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to even if they could. In the era of sailing ships, the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now \u2014 dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on, but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere, and the farther away the better. Bringing babies into the world was considered wholly the province of women (doctors were summoned only if matters had taken a decidedly bad turn, and even then only rarely), and men were present at such events only when it could not otherwise be avoided. Men certainly did not voluntarily insert themselves into the proceedings, nor would their presence have been welcomed by the women straining to bring children into the world, the midwives attending them, and the array of female relatives that inevitably gathered by the bedside. Third, although a certain convoluted train of logic might tie the firing of large guns to hastening a difficult birth (e.g., inspiration by example, a cornerstone of sympathetic magic), there\u2019s no reason to believe anyone living in those times even tried this, let alone that the practice was so widespread that the firing of guns to ease childbirth begat a distinct phrase. Histories of life in the 1700s and 1800s are thunderous in their silence about this practice, and it can safely be assumed that quiet reflects a stunning truth about the matter \u2014 that whatever tales we\u2019re now telling ourselves, cannonfire wasn\u2019t being used to hasten babies into the world. Granted, gunfire had been employed in distant times to fend off disease (it never worked), so there is some historical basis for a tie between the discharge of firearms and medical emergencies.

In that 30-year time frame, El Paso was never one of the \u201cmost dangerous cities\u201d in the United States.

What did make a difference was a flood of Border Patrol agents, who began Operation Hold the Line in 1993. Hundreds of agents were stationed every few feet along the border.

The strange appearance of the skulls coupled with the outlandish claim continues to give the story legs, and it continues to make the rounds as of mid-January 2017: The director of the Paracas Museum of History sent five samples of the Paracas skulls to undergo genetic testing, and the results were mesmerizing. The samples which consisted of hair, skin teeth and some fragments of cranial bones gave incredible details that have fueled the mystery surrounding these anomalous skulls. The genetic laboratory to where the samples were sent was not informed of the origin of the skulls in order to avoid \u2018influenced results.\u2019 Interestingly, the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, showed mutations that were unknown to any man, primate or animal found on planet Earth. The mutations present in the samples of the Paracas skulls suggest that researchers were dealing with a completely new \u2018human-like being,\u2019 very different from Homo sapiens, Neanderthals or Denisovans. The announcement in 2014 that the skulls had non-human DNA was originally promoted by Brien Foerster, a figure known for pseudoscience. As RationalWiki notes: Foerster has little in the way of relevant scientific qualifications but runs a tour company and was a regular on the very unscientific History Channel show Ancient Aliens, the museum is a private company owned by a man with no scientific qualifications, not an academic institution, and the results were announced not in a peer reviewed journal but on Facebook.

The latest hypothesis to join the list, however, is the belief that skull shaping could have been a boon for survival to some who practiced it, as proposed by Marta Alfonso-Durruty, an anthropologist at Kansas State University, and colleagues in a new research paper published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women. This is not the first time a discovery of human remains with elongated skulls sparked the hopes of UFO enthusiasts. A 2015 discovery of a prehistoric woman in Russia, at a site known as Arkaim or \u201cRussia\u2019s Stonehenge,\u201d with a similar deformity also created a buzz: Some believe that the skull\u2019s high forehead is characteristic of the so-called \u201calien grey\u201d often depicted as large-eyed and large-foreheaded beings in sci-fi films and even hoaxes. Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to.

They wrapped\u00a0their babies\u2019 heads with rope, cloths and wooden boards in order to lengthen their skulls. This was done for spiritual or religious reasons, and scholars believe that it was an effort to look more like their deities.

Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa.

It merely stated that \u201cantifa\u201d rented U-Hauls en masse, and left sharers to fill in the details with their imaginations.Judging by the rumor\u2019s traction, the strategy was highly effective.A First Wave of the Same RumorTwitter nuisance and Pizzagate pusher Jack Posobiec\u00a0made a point of\u00a0mentioning vague and unsourced \u201cintelligence\u201d received by police in New York and Washington, DC about the use of U-Hauls on June 2 2020:UPDATE: Now DC is receiving intelligence about U-Haul trucks connected to suspected weapons stashes around the city\u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) June 2, 2020It\u2019s Going Down\u00a0tweeted about the rumors on the same day, citing a Fox News article with dubious information:Neo-Nazi groups, already shut down by Twitter, promoted on social media the lie that \"\"ANTIFA\"\" was going to come into suburban \"\"white hoods\"\" to riot and attack people. Now this lie is being promoted at #FoxNews. Egregious example of misinformation and manipulation. pic.twitter.com\/mrBXhyeb37\u2014 It's Going Down (@IGD_News) June 2, 2020@IGD_News referenced a June 2 2020 Fox News article\u00a0(\u201cAntifa arrests coming, concerns over riots heading to suburbia, government source says\u201d) which essentially served as an in-print version of the same rumor. Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa. Two days later, Twitter nuisance Jack Posobiec and Fox News spread iterations of the claim; predictably, no such \u201cinvasion\u201d came to pass. A similar and likely directly related rumor circulated about \u201cantifa buses\u201d in Ada, Oklahoma, and it too was false. In particular, the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor posed a risk to customers of U-Haul, who were at risk specifically if they were moving into a new neighborhood where the rumor had taken root.Comments\"n\nClaim: \"Antifa is renting U-Hauls to quietly infiltrate \"\"residential neighborhoods\"\" for \"\"attacks.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that Antifa is renting U-Hauls to infiltrate residential neighborhoods for attacks is false. The evidence provided indicates that the rumor originated from a fake anti-fascist Twitter account linked to white supremacists and accelerationists. The claim was spread without any credible sources or evidence, and no actual attacks by Antifa involving U-Hauls in residential neighborhoods have occurred. Therefore, the claim is false."}
{"claim_id":10255,"hypothesis":"Study Finds Single, Escalated Dose of Brachytherapy Radiation May Be a Safe and Effective Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer","date_published":"March 3, 2017","explanation_1":"This news release from a professional society of radiation oncologists summarizes a trial in 58 men with Stage 1 localized prostate cancer that found using a single treatment of\u00a0high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (where radioactive implants are inserted directly into the tissue) may be an acceptable and safe alternative to typical longer, but lower doses of radiation. Recognizing\u00a0that a higher dose, single radiation treatment could be more toxic to tissues surrounding the prostate, this trial set out to measure the effectiveness and safety of such treatment. While the research was non-randomized, its generally positive tone was balanced by\u00a0emphasizing that there needs to be additional follow-up research to see how it compares with conventional approaches. After stating in the headline the treatment \u201cmay be safe and effective,\u201d the release provides a fairly detailed description of harms. A concern with this study is that nearly all of the patient volunteers would have been candidates for active surveillance\u2013meaning that they did not need an active treatment. With no caveat that expert guidelines recommend surveillance for low-risk Stage 1 prostate cancers, this release engages in disease-mongering. It is recognized that exposure to radioactive treatments can be harmful and so finding other ways to treat tumors in the prostate should be welcomed. If a treatment for localized prostate cancer which is\u00a0administered in a single procedure, is equally effective and safe as conventional treatment, it is possible that patients may have fewer side effects and adverse events related to their prostate cancer treatment. This\u00a0study provides some\u00a0data on the safety and tolerability of the single dose of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy compared to\u00a0LDR brachytherapy, \u00a0It is important to note that these patients were a very select sample of prostate cancer patients (low to intermediate risk) and so extrapolating those findings to other prostate cancer patients may not be appropriate.","fact_checkers":"Alan Cassels,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"There was zero mention of cost, which is unfortunate because presumably a single treatment would entail fewer costs than one that involved multiple procedures. The main benefit focused on a vaguely described \u201cbiochemical progression,\u201d which means that there was some evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Determining PSA progression is more complicated following radiation because it takes time for the PSA level to stabilize (unlike following surgery to remove the prostate) before you can determine whether the PSA is rising. Biochemical progression is also a surrogate measure and does not imply that the cancer is\u2013or will\u2013clinically progress. The researchers did acknowledge that the actual benefits are unknown, saying that \u201cas the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d The release provided detailed information on harms: \u201cWithin the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency\/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\u201d But given that many oncology experts would consider the treatment unnecessary, any level of toxicity\u00a0could be considered unacceptable. The lay reader would have benefited from a description of what \u201cgrade 2 or grad 3+\u201d levels of toxicity means. There were a few issues that could have been clarified: the fact that these men were quite low risk to start with, that five of the initial patients dropped out of the study (and we aren\u2019t told why) and that this was a non-randomized, prospective clinical trial which is potentially subject to a series of biases. The key takeaway is that this evidence does not establish the superiority of this approach to any other radiotherapy, any active treatment, or active surveillance. The quote from a study author at the end of the release indicating that more research was required and this study was not definitive proof of the superiority of the 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy was a welcome caution, and somewhat at odds with the overall positive tone of the release. Promoting brachytherapy radiation for treatment of low-risk men is a form of disease-mongering, particularly since there is no mention of the surveillance option. The American Urological Association (AUA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that men with low-risk cancers be offered active surveillance.

The news release suggests that this is a new strategy based on new research but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. According to UpToDate, an evidence-based list of practice recommendations published by Wolters Kluwer, use of single, high dose brachytherapy for prostate cancer is not novel: \u201cThe HDR brachytherapy dose is usually administered in one to four large dose fractions over a period of time, typically 24 to 40 hours. Patients receiving more than one fraction are usually admitted to the hospital (typically a 23 hour \u201coutpatient stay\u201d) for treatment when delivering multiple fractions and retain the perineal catheters in place for the entire period.\u201d The release detracts from the actual study when it states that the research \u201cillustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation\u2026\u201d \u00a0This seems unjustified in the context of the trial.

{"claim_id":37782,"hypothesis":"Someone put a tampon into a Los Angeles police officer's Starbucks drink.","date_published":"June 23, 2020","explanation_1":"Did a Los Angeles Police Officer Find a Tampon in His Starbucks Cup?","fact_checkers":"  Arturo Garcia  ","premise":"Police in Los Angeles accused workers at a nearby Target store of tampering with an off-duty officer\u2019s drink in June 2020, reigniting debate following other questionable claims by law enforcement agencies \u2014 but the object in the drink wasn\u2019t what was initially claimed.According to KTTV-TV, the officer allegedly found what he described as \u201ca tampon\u201d inside the Frappuccino he ordered at a Starbucks located within the Target in Diamond Bar, a small city in Los Angeles County. Reporter Bill Melugin posted a photograph of the alleged tampon on Twitter:The officer was reportedly not wearing his uniform and paid for the drink with a debit card issued by a police credit union.We contacted Target seeking comment; the company sent us the same statement it gave to KTTV:We take this allegation seriously. We have reviewed video footage and have not found any suspicious behavior. We have shared the video with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and look forward to the conclusions of their investigation.Reached for comment and asked how the officer determined that the alleged object was a tampon, the sheriff\u2019s department also shared a statement:Walnut Station Detectives are investigating an incident of alleged poisoning of food or drink at a local business. The incident was reported to have occurred Friday, June 19, 2020 at approximately 2:30p.m., on the 700 block of Grand Avenue in the city of Diamond Bar. The victim as a male White 36 years-old. This is an ongoing investigation. No further information is available at this time.The claim was formally debunked in late July 2020, when \u2014\u00a0according to KTTV \u2014 police determined that there was no \u201cattack.\u201d The staff member who prepared the drink unwittingly \u201cscooped up a cleaning cloth that had fallen into ice\u201d into the officer\u2019s drink.\u201cThe investigation was unable to prove malicious intent on the part of the store employee,\u201d Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing local officers, initially called the alleged incident a \u201cdisgusting assault on a police officer was carried out by someone with hatred in their heart.\u201dBut even before the company\u2019s statement, the claim of \u201cassault\u201d drew skepticism. Two separate news sites, Jezebel and Vice, conducted their own tests to see whether a tampon dipped into a Frappuccino would come out looking like the object in Melugin\u2019s photo. The results of both tests ran counter to police allegations. According to Jezebel\u2019s Megan Reynolds:The substance found in the Frappuccino does not resemble any sort of tampon that I\u2019ve ever used or seen in the wild. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s clumpy, and if you look at it quickly, resembles a cat hairball or maybe some paper towels. A tampon doesn\u2019t expand lengthwise and if it did, the shape would be uniform and not lumpen and irregular, as this item is. Tampons expand widthwise to accommodate a wide variety of body shapes and types. Everyone\u2019s vagina is different, but a tampon that resembled housing insulation or a long clot of cotton batting would be entirely ineffective.Meanwhile, Vice reported that the object posted in Melugin\u2019s photograph measured 4.957 inches, nearly an inch longer than the final length of the tampon the site used to recreate the alleged incident by soaking it in water and then leaving it inside a Frappuccino for two hours.\u201cSuspicious, but not outside the realm of possibility for a lesser-quality tampon,\u201d Vice noted. \u201cOther things to keep in mind is that it appears the very bottom of the tampon is cut off in the photo uploaded to Twitter, and we do not know what zoom the image was taken at.\u201dThe intentional poisoning claim from Los Angeles police came less than a month after police union officials in New York City accused workers at a Shake Shack restaurant in Manhattan of doing the same to their own colleagues. As the New York Post reported:A lieutenant from the Bronx blasted out an email to the unions that six cops \u201cstarted throwing up after drinking beverages they got from shake shack on 200 Broadway.\u201dIt was unclear why the sergeant and lieutenant escalated the situation.Detectives easily closed the case after interviewing five employees and reviewing surveillance footage showing the shakes were made normally, sources said.The machine was cleaned before the officers ordered, according to sources, and it still contained residual milkstone remover \u2014 a typically acidic solution used to combat buildup in dairy equipment.But by 10:45 p.m., the Detectives Endowment Association was declaring that Finest had become \u201cill\u201d after being \u201cintentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack\u201d \u2014 as Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch made a show of visiting Bellevue while his union declared at 10:47 p.m. that police officers came \u201cunder attack\u201d from a \u201ctoxic substance, believed to be bleach.\u201dThe allegation was debunked only one day later when Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison posted, \u201cAfter a thorough investigation by the NYPD\u2019s Manhattan South investigators, it has been determined that there was no criminality by shake shack\u2019s employees.\u201dIt is worth noting that the \u201cshunned policeman\u201d is a known urban legend \u2014 a subtheme of the \u201cshunned serviceman\u201d folklore. The stories generally revolve around either some sort of attempt to poison or harm the aggrieved party via something put in their food or drink, or outright refusal to serve them. Stories of this nature are very rarely (if ever) true.Update July 29, 2020 9:41 a.m. PST: Updated throughout following determination that the object found in the drink was not a \u201ctampon.\u201dComments","sources":"https:\/\/www.chron.com\/news\/houston-texas\/texas\/article\/Pilot-Flying-J-American-Flag-viral-hate-online-12941346.php, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Flapd-starbucks-target-tampon%2F, https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/ep4vek\/did-a-barista-put-a-tampon-in-a-cops-frappuccino-an-investigation, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Flapd-starbucks-target-tampon%2F, https:\/\/www.foxla.com\/news\/update-lasd-investigation-determines-a-cleaning-cloth-was-in-off-duty-officers-drink-not-tampon, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Flapd-starbucks-target-tampon%2F, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Flapd-starbucks-target-tampon%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Did+a+Los+Angeles+Police+Officer+Find+a+Tampon+in+His+Starbucks+Cup%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Flapd-starbucks-target-tampon%2F&via=erumors, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/were-four-busloads-of-protesters-or-antifa-in-ada-oklahoma-met-by-600-armed-americans-and-the-news-wont-report-it\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.foxla.com\/news\/lasd-investigating-tampon-allegedly-placed-in-off-duty-lapd-officers-drink, https:\/\/twitter.com\/NYPDDetectives\/status\/1272801631961260032?s=20, https:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/06\/22\/how-nypd-faked-shake-shack-controversy-and-conspiracy-theory\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-this-a-shooting-target-holding-a-phone-in-the-police-supply-section-of-a-gun-store-in-lexington-kentucky\/, https:\/\/archive.fo\/IdxZ5, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/art\/, https:\/\/jezebel.com\/is-this-a-tampon-in-a-frappucino-or-nah-1844134224, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/tag\/shunned-policeman\/","label":2,"subjects":"Disinformation, Fact Checks","__index_level_0__":8454,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nPolice in Los Angeles accused workers at a nearby Target store of tampering with an off-duty officer\u2019s drink in June 2020, reigniting debate following other questionable claims by law enforcement agencies \u2014 but the object in the drink wasn\u2019t what was initially claimed.According to KTTV-TV, the officer allegedly found what he described as \u201ca tampon\u201d inside the Frappuccino he ordered at a Starbucks located within the Target in Diamond Bar, a small city in Los Angeles County.

No further information is available at this time.The claim was formally debunked in late July 2020, when \u2014\u00a0according to KTTV \u2014 police determined that there was no \u201cattack.\u201d The staff member who prepared the drink unwittingly \u201cscooped up a cleaning cloth that had fallen into ice\u201d into the officer\u2019s drink.\u201cThe investigation was unable to prove malicious intent on the part of the store employee,\u201d Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing local officers, initially called the alleged incident a \u201cdisgusting assault on a police officer was carried out by someone with hatred in their heart.\u201dBut even before the company\u2019s statement, the claim of \u201cassault\u201d drew skepticism. Two separate news sites, Jezebel and Vice, conducted their own tests to see whether a tampon dipped into a Frappuccino would come out looking like the object in Melugin\u2019s photo. The results of both tests ran counter to police allegations. According to Jezebel\u2019s Megan Reynolds:The substance found in the Frappuccino does not resemble any sort of tampon that I\u2019ve ever used or seen in the wild. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s clumpy, and if you look at it quickly, resembles a cat hairball or maybe some paper towels. A tampon doesn\u2019t expand lengthwise and if it did, the shape would be uniform and not lumpen and irregular, as this item is. Tampons expand widthwise to accommodate a wide variety of body shapes and types. Everyone\u2019s vagina is different, but a tampon that resembled housing insulation or a long clot of cotton batting would be entirely ineffective.Meanwhile, Vice reported that the object posted in Melugin\u2019s photograph measured 4.957 inches, nearly an inch longer than the final length of the tampon the site used to recreate the alleged incident by soaking it in water and then leaving it inside a Frappuccino for two hours.\u201cSuspicious, but not outside the realm of possibility for a lesser-quality tampon,\u201d Vice noted. \u201cOther things to keep in mind is that it appears the very bottom of the tampon is cut off in the photo uploaded to Twitter, and we do not know what zoom the image was taken at.\u201dThe intentional poisoning claim from Los Angeles police came less than a month after police union officials in New York City accused workers at a Shake Shack restaurant in Manhattan of doing the same to their own colleagues. As the New York Post reported:A lieutenant from the Bronx blasted out an email to the unions that six cops \u201cstarted throwing up after drinking beverages they got from shake shack on 200 Broadway.\u201dIt was unclear why the sergeant and lieutenant escalated the situation.Detectives easily closed the case after interviewing five employees and reviewing surveillance footage showing the shakes were made normally, sources said.The machine was cleaned before the officers ordered, according to sources, and it still contained residual milkstone remover \u2014 a typically acidic solution used to combat buildup in dairy equipment.But by 10:45 p.m., the Detectives Endowment Association was declaring that Finest had become \u201cill\u201d after being \u201cintentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack\u201d \u2014 as Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch made a show of visiting Bellevue while his union declared at 10:47 p.m. that police officers came \u201cunder attack\u201d from a \u201ctoxic substance, believed to be bleach.\u201dThe allegation was debunked only one day later when Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison posted, \u201cAfter a thorough investigation by the NYPD\u2019s Manhattan South investigators, it has been determined that there was no criminality by shake shack\u2019s employees.\u201dIt is worth noting that the \u201cshunned policeman\u201d is a known urban legend \u2014 a subtheme of the \u201cshunned serviceman\u201d folklore. The stories generally revolve around either some sort of attempt to poison or harm the aggrieved party via something put in their food or drink, or outright refusal to serve them. Stories of this nature are very rarely (if ever) true.Update July 29, 2020 9:41 a.m. PST: Updated throughout following determination that the object found in the drink was not a \u201ctampon.\u201dCommentsn\nClaim: Someone put a tampon into a Los Angeles police officer's Starbucks drink.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim is false.

{"claim_id":9245,"hypothesis":"Even partial steroid treatment can benefit extremely preterm infants, NIH study suggests","date_published":"October 18, 2016","explanation_1":"This news release by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) covers research findings on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment in pregnant women expecting preterm delivery, as published in JAMA Pediatrics. Although women likely to deliver before 34 weeks are routinely given steroid treatment to reduce the chance of complications, physicians weren\u2019t sure whether a partial course of treatment would provide the same \u2014 or any \u2014 benefits. In this new study, researchers concluded that ANS therapy was dose-dependent in providing protective effects against death or neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm infants. The release claims that even partial steroid treatment can\u00a0 benefit those born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. Details on funding sources and treatment\u2019s context are given high up in the news release. It also starts out well by providing some relevant figures, such as the number of subjects in the study, their gestational ages and follow-up times. However, other important quantitative data aren\u2019t disclosed at all, such as the extent of the treatment\u2019s benefits in the three groups, as well as the costs associated with steroid therapy. Instead, only sweeping, vague comparative language is used to illustrate complications and other outcomes, which leaves the reader wondering how beneficial steroid treatment really is. Another major point that was not mentioned was the study\u2019s limitations \u2014 namely that this was an observational cohort study that cannot establish cause and effect. Patients were not blinded to their treatments and were not randomized, which led to an unequal distribution of patients in the 3 groups in terms of socioeconomic status and other infant variables. In the end, the complete ANS treatment group already had distinct advantages from these factors in achieving better outcomes. Although studies on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment already exist in the body of literature, there hasn\u2019t been much research looking at dose-dependent effects of ANS on extremely premature infants, especially in regard to early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other studies have looked into partial ANS courses and rates of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease among infants. Steroids are routinely given to pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks and are considered to be standard treatment. However, there is no clear protocol on administering ANS treatment when premature delivery is approaching, since completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours. If the latest research shows that even partial ANS treatment provides benefits to preterm infants, this should be reported to empower patients and to guide clinical practice.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"The two antenatal steroids (ANS) used in this study included betamethasone and dexamethasone, but their costs were never mentioned. A complete course of ANS was defined as 2 intramuscular doses of betamethasone administered 24 hours apart or 4 doses of dexamethasone administered 12 hours apart. According to drugs.com, 500 mL of dexamethasone costs $23.94. Our online search didn\u2019t uncover any price estimates for liquid Betamethasone. Drugs.com only lists topical Betamethasone prices. We always like to see a ballpark range of costs in news releases, so consumers can estimate their therapy costs. Since costs are not discussed in the news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. It\u2019s worth noting here that the actual costs of the steroids pale in comparison to the cost of the overall treatment of these infants. If the partial treatment is even\u00a0partially effective, that could lower future medical care costs. Although the news release gives figures for the number of study participants and their gestational ages, it doesn\u2019t provide any quantitative data on the benefits of steroid therapy. Instead, it uses broad, vague language, such as \u201csignificant differences in rates of death.\u201d It also states, \u201cInfants in the complete treatment group fared best,\u201d and \u201cinfants in the partial treatment group fared better than untreated infants.\u201d As we have pointed out in previous reviews, the word \u201csignificant\u201d is confusing and ambiguous, since it could mean \u201cstatistically significant\u201d or \u201cremarkable\/substantial,\u201d the colloquial use of the term. Without any numbers to put \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d into perspective, readers are left wondering just how well each group fared. The original journal article gives the rates of various complications in percentages. Since the study\u2019s primary objective was to compare the rates of death or neurodevelopmental impairment in infants born between 22-27 weeks, it would have been sufficient to disclose only these figures for the three groups. Researchers wrote, \u201cDeath or neurodevelopmental impairment occurred in 68.1%, 54.4% and 48.1% of patients in the no, partial and complete ANS (antenatal steroids) groups, respectively.\u201d Since the news release does not quantify the benefits for its readers, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here.

Although this therapy is generally deemed to be safe, some studies have reported undesired effects on the mother\u2019s immune system and metabolism, as well as reduction of fetal heart rate and breathing movements. A multiple course of antenatal steroids might even slow fetal intrauterine growth and lower neonatal birth weight. Since harms were not addressed, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating. The news release does an appropriate job disclosing the number of participants and follow-up times and listing treatment groups and outcome measurements (although not quantitatively). However, it doesn\u2019t detail any of the study\u2019s limitations.

Researchers also acknowledged that there was an unequal distribution of patients in the three groups because of the observational design.

For example, the complete ANS group were comprised of individuals more likely to have a high school education, be white and married, and less likely to be on public insurance, compared to the other two groups. The infants of the ANS group were also more likely to have a higher mean birth weight and a higher mean gestational age, compared to the other two groups.

There was no mention of conflicts of interest, since there were none reported in the original journal article. Alternative therapies are not discussed in the news release. For women who are more likely to deliver prematurely, they may receive a progesterone shot \u2014 the most common being the 17-OHPC shot \u2014 to prevent preterm birth. Other medications, such as tocolytics, which include ritodrine, magnesium sulfate, calcium channel blockers and indomethacin, can be administered to delay delivery. Additionally, women in preterm labor usually are given antibiotics, as some studies have suggested that antibiotics may prolong pregnancy and reduce problems in the newborn.

One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves. The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study\u2019s findings\u00a0(such as the\u00a0researchers\u2019 conclusions that\u00a0the results are of \u201cuncertain clinical importance\u201d).

Urinary incontinence is common, affecting millions of individuals, both women and men. The prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal result of aging.

This article describes a small randomized clinical trial comparing the results of weight-loss surgery (with either the gastric bypass procedure or placement of an adjustable gastric band) to dietary and exercise (\u201clifestyle\u201d) treatments to rid people of type 2 diabetes. The 61 obese adults in the study were taking either insulin or oral anti-diabetic medication, were mostly women and Caucasian, and were followed for three years. Overall, the story does a good job of laying out the benefits and goes to great lengths to put the results in context, noting in the lede sentence that this study is merely \u201cadding\u201d to the \u201cgrowing body of evidence\u201d favoring surgery over life style treatments for diabetes resolution. It also quotes those who caution readers about some limits of the study and warn against a willy-nilly\u00a0rush to the operating room. The article would have benefited from some information about the costs and potential harms of bariatric surgery, as well as details on availability and barriers to access for these procedures. Several types of surgery that essentially restrict stomach size and bypass portions of the intestine that absorb nutrients have been shown to result in long-term weight loss. These bariatric surgeries\u00a0are\u00a0not without risk, but have become increasingly popular, particularly for the severely obese. And as this new study suggests \u2014 and for reasons the article makes clear are not completely understood \u2014 the surgical treatments appear to not only significantly reduce weight, but also alter the biology of glucose and diabetic risk. They seem to do this better than lifestyle -based interventions, which often produce limited reductions in weight that returns all too quickly. Stories like this matter, not only because of the potential impact on public health, but also because bariatric surgery is expensive and has become a marketing opportunity for many medical centers and clinics.

The study followed 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease for 12 weeks after treating them with either apomorphine or placebo. The study measured the participants\u2019 \u201coff\u201d times, which refer to periods when a medication isn\u2019t working well, causing symptoms to worsen. Although the news release provides in-depth historical context and information on the availability of the drug, we wish it could have more critically evaluated the evidence, as well as provided more numbers to illustrate the benefit claims. A discussion on the limitations of evidence, namely how this study may have been through limited peer review, would have been useful. The news release does disclose the funding source \u2014 Britannia Pharmaceuticals, the maker of apomorphine \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t mention that the first author has received speaking and consulting fees from Britannia for at least 8 years. Parkinson\u2019s disease is a progressive disorder affecting the nervous system caused by the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. It affects more than 4 million people worldwide, according to the US National Library of Medicine. About 60,000 new cases are identified each year in the United States. Although there is no cure, many of its symptoms (including tremor, slowed movement, rigidity and problems with balance) can be managed with drug therapies, the main one being levodopa. After long-term use, however, the benefits of levodopa may wear off more quickly after each dose, prolonging \u201coff\u201d times in Parkinson\u2019s patients. If there is another medication that is safe and shortens \u201coff\u201d times, it may provide help to patients who develop resistance to a certain drug, especially with long-term use.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"According to GoodRx.com, 20 cartridges or 3 mL of apomorphine cost between $20,000 to $21,800 depending on the pharmacy. The exact dosage isn\u2019t disclosed, but we know that the infusion was administered via a small portable pump for 14 to 18 hours each day for 12 weeks. Since costs are not discussed in this news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release says that on average, volunteers assigned to apomorphine had 2.5 hours less \u201coff\u201d time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in \u201coff\u201d time during the first week of the trial. Participant-reported scores on how well they thought the treatment worked were also provided: \u201cParticipants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo.\u201d While improvement is given in percentages (and we like to see absolute numbers as well) this does illustrate an absolute rate of improvement. Apomorphine is associated with a slew of side effects \u2013 the more common ones being chest pain, chills, cold sweats, confusion, falling asleep during activity, dizziness, mood changes, swelling and twitching. Less common include fainting, low blood pressure, sweating and vomiting. Rare adverse events are irregular heartbeat and recurrent fainting. In the study, apomorphine was generally well tolerated, and no serious side effects were observed, the news release states. No other safety information is given. One 2009 study looked at the safety of apomorphine when treating \u201coff\u201d episodes in subjects with advanced Parkinson disease. Out of the 546 subjects in the study population, 187 participants discontinued treatment because of side effects, which included nausea and vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, hallucination, yawning, and injection site bruising. The authors concluded, \u201cLong-term use of intermittent apomorphine dosing for treatment of \u2018off\u2019 episodes was generally associated with mild-to-moderate adverse effects.\u201d Another recent 10-year observational study concluded, \u201cMany patients cannot be maintained on AI in the longer term\u201d due to adverse effects and inadequate motor benefit. We wish the news release talked more in depth about the drug\u2019s potential harms, which is why we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release does a good job outlining the study design. This was a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter phase III study, in which researchers followed 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease for 12 weeks. The infusion was administered via a small portable pump from 14 to 18 hours per day. What\u2019s missing here is a discussion on the study\u2019s limitations, namely the lack of peer review. Since this study was presented at a medical conference, it may only include preliminary findings and probably also went through a limited peer review process. Peer review is important in establishing the quality and integrity of the science before publication in a journal. Since limitations of the evidence are not discussed, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no disease mongering in this news release. It provides context about the history of the drug. A statement on the incidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease would also have been helpful in understanding the scope of the problem. The funding source of this study was Britannia Pharmaceuticals, a UK-based pharmaceutical company specializing in the neurology market, according to its website. However, the release doesn\u2019t mention that the first author of the study had received research grants from numerous pharmaceutical companies, including Britannia and that the principal investigator is also a consultant for Britannia and serves on its advisory board. We rate this for not disclosing a long-term financial relationship between the author and the drug sponsor. The release gets a Satisfactory for noting that the oral drug levodopa is the gold standard treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease. The release would have been better had it also addressed some comparison between levodopa and the drug discussed in this release. Also not mentioned are other treatment possibilities include dopamine agonists and deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure that sends electrical pulses to the brain and helps stabilize medication fluctuations. We think it would present a clearer picture had the release mentioned some of the other existing and newer emerging treatments for this condition.

The study abstract on the American Academy of Neurology website states that this was the first prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of apomorphine infusions versus placebo in Parkinson\u2019s patients.

The exact dosage isn\u2019t disclosed, but we know that the infusion was administered via a small portable pump for 14 to 18 hours each day for 12 weeks. Since costs are not discussed in this news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release says that on average, volunteers assigned to apomorphine had 2.5 hours less \u201coff\u201d time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in \u201coff\u201d time during the first week of the trial. Participant-reported scores on how well they thought the treatment worked were also provided: \u201cParticipants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo.\u201d While improvement is given in percentages (and we like to see absolute numbers as well) this does illustrate an absolute rate of improvement. Apomorphine is associated with a slew of side effects \u2013 the more common ones being chest pain, chills, cold sweats, confusion, falling asleep during activity, dizziness, mood changes, swelling and twitching. Less common include fainting, low blood pressure, sweating and vomiting. Rare adverse events are irregular heartbeat and recurrent fainting. In the study, apomorphine was generally well tolerated, and no serious side effects were observed, the news release states. No other safety information is given. One 2009 study looked at the safety of apomorphine when treating \u201coff\u201d episodes in subjects with advanced Parkinson disease. Out of the 546 subjects in the study population, 187 participants discontinued treatment because of side effects, which included nausea and vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, hallucination, yawning, and injection site bruising. The authors concluded, \u201cLong-term use of intermittent apomorphine dosing for treatment of \u2018off\u2019 episodes was generally associated with mild-to-moderate adverse effects.\u201d Another recent 10-year observational study concluded, \u201cMany patients cannot be maintained on AI in the longer term\u201d due to adverse effects and inadequate motor benefit. We wish the news release talked more in depth about the drug\u2019s potential harms, which is why we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release does a good job outlining the study design. This was a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter phase III study, in which researchers followed 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease for 12 weeks. The infusion was administered via a small portable pump from 14 to 18 hours per day. What\u2019s missing here is a discussion on the study\u2019s limitations, namely the lack of peer review. Since this study was presented at a medical conference, it may only include preliminary findings and probably also went through a limited peer review process. Peer review is important in establishing the quality and integrity of the science before publication in a journal. Since limitations of the evidence are not discussed, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no disease mongering in this news release. It provides context about the history of the drug. A statement on the incidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease would also have been helpful in understanding the scope of the problem. The funding source of this study was Britannia Pharmaceuticals, a UK-based pharmaceutical company specializing in the neurology market, according to its website. However, the release doesn\u2019t mention that the first author of the study had received research grants from numerous pharmaceutical companies, including Britannia and that the principal investigator is also a consultant for Britannia and serves on its advisory board. We rate this for not disclosing a long-term financial relationship between the author and the drug sponsor. The release gets a Satisfactory for noting that the oral drug levodopa is the gold standard treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease. The release would have been better had it also addressed some comparison between levodopa and the drug discussed in this release. Also not mentioned are other treatment possibilities include dopamine agonists and deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure that sends electrical pulses to the brain and helps stabilize medication fluctuations. We think it would present a clearer picture had the release mentioned some of the other existing and newer emerging treatments for this condition. The news release makes it clear from the start that apomorphine is not a new drug, as the headline refers to it as a \u201c150-year-old drug.\u201d Since the news release gives a brief historical overview of the drug, we feel it merits a Satisfactory rating here. The release would have been better if it had mentioned whether or not it\u2019s covered by insurance as an FDA approved treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease.

The claim that a 150-year-old drug may provide 'off' time relief for people with advanced Parkinson's Disease is partially true because the evidence provided does support that the drug apomorphine, which has been around for 150 years, was found to reduce \"off\" time in Parkinson's patients in the study discussed. However, the evidence also highlights concerns about the drug's side effects and limitations in the study design, which raises questions about the effectiveness and safety of the drug.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated? Including the school lunches they are delivering?? Doesnt the virus live on things for a period of time? Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks. If you know how to sew, have a sewing machine, and are up for that challenge, here\u2019s how you can help:Pick up a kit that will include all the materials you need to make 100 masks. We\u2019ll offer various pick-up and drop-off times and locations. The first date and location for picking up a kit is [listed. ]Be sure to check back for future kit distribution dates and locations as we will be updating regularly.A contact form providing the organizers of the 100 Million Mask Challenge with information for volunteers followed; filling out the form did not lead to any additional information on the kits\u2019 contents or parameters.Organizing the 100 Million Mask Challenge appeared to be\u00a0Providence.org, described on the site\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page as \u201cthe largest health care provider in Washington state\u201d:Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state. Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.","sources":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/blog.providence.org\/coronavirus\/volunteers-making-homemade-masks-to-combat-shortages-caused-by-covid-19, https:\/\/www.providence.org\/lp\/100m-masks, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control\/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/infection-control\/control-recommendations.html, https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/coronavirus-interview-larry-brilliant-smallpox-epidemiologist\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27100+Million+Masks%27+--+Are+Homemade+Masks+Sufficient+for+COVID-19+First+Responders%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/face-masks.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/respirators-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/rapunzel-was-quarantined-in-tangled-google-the-name-of-her-kingdom\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-deaconess-ask-public-provide-medical-face-masks\/2865273001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/20\/coronvavirus-whole-world-responding-deaconess-face-masks-plea\/2884671001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/letters-health-care-providers\/surgical-mask-and-gown-conservation-strategies-letter-healthcare-providers, https:\/\/washington.providence.org\/about, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/natural-news-cdc-coronavirus\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeaconessHealthSystem\/posts\/10156622869747273?__cft__[0]=AZWNrouqxgFJbXaeggpz4E2RA8iOBJtkFvtemEZn4bq-hM2QI5K2E1IGUqrrCs9LhNGBN4mRzgLOh-OIyGFpI5jhdP3Xhm_rsPbfe4vOnKuYENNBdpfy3BUEB_8nnGrPF_gd1XN4qgLtXa8KhvV2sujUIxfHi1WLv3VEwkav9wASkA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1012,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn March 20 2020, KOMO anchor Mary Nam shared a photograph of a person wearing a surgical mask (a form of personal protective equipment, or PPE, known to be in short supply due the coronavirus pandemic), and put out a call for anyone who knows how to sew and has access to a sewing machine to participate in an effort to fortify COVID-19 medical supplies with homemade surgical masks:Know how to sew?

The mask design was lab tested to ensure safety and effectiveness. **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained a page, \u201cN95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks),\u201d defining the terms used during discussions of PPE shortages; linked on that page was a March 11 2020 letter from the FDA about coping with PPE shortages in a clinical environment:N95 respirators and surgical masks (face masks) are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated? Including the school lunches they are delivering?? Doesnt the virus live on things for a period of time? Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks. If you know how to sew, have a sewing machine, and are up for that challenge, here\u2019s how you can help:Pick up a kit that will include all the materials you need to make 100 masks. We\u2019ll offer various pick-up and drop-off times and locations. The first date and location for picking up a kit is [listed. ]Be sure to check back for future kit distribution dates and locations as we will be updating regularly.A contact form providing the organizers of the 100 Million Mask Challenge with information for volunteers followed; filling out the form did not lead to any additional information on the kits\u2019 contents or parameters.Organizing the 100 Million Mask Challenge appeared to be\u00a0Providence.org, described on the site\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page as \u201cthe largest health care provider in Washington state\u201d:Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state. Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.n\nClaim: Homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other PPE is partially true and false. \n\nThe evidence shows that the CDC guidelines do allow for alternatives to N95s and other PPE when there is a shortage, and homemade masks can be used as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, and their capability to protect healthcare professionals is unknown. The CDC advises caution when considering this option and recommends that homemade masks be used in combination with a face shield for added protection. Therefore, while homemade masks can provide some level of protection, they are not as effective as surgical masks or N95 respirators."}

No, we\u2019re not talking about Flint, Mich. This concerns the southeast Asian city of Manila, the capital and\u00a0biggest city in the Philippines. In 1997, officials in the Pacific island nation set up not one but two private companies to deliver water to homes and businesses. One of those companies has been a financial success. So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation\u2019s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. \"\"In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent,\"\" Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose\u00a0by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore\u2019s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging. The soundest data we could find was in a 2013 report from local regulators, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took\u00a0place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate  (pesos\/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a  typical bill Typical household bill  (1997 pesos) 121 295 537  As you\u2019ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila\u2019s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization \"\"was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s.\"\" The IFC\u2019s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"\" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. \"\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\"\" Jones said. \"\"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"\" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. \"\"If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it\u2019s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,\"\" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before. Our ruling Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up.

This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took\u00a0place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate  (pesos\/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a  typical bill Typical household bill  (1997 pesos) 121 295 537  As you\u2019ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila\u2019s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization \"\"was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s.\"\" The IFC\u2019s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"\" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. \"\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\"\" Jones said. \"\"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"\" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. \"\"If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it\u2019s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,\"\" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before. Our ruling Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family\u2019s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before. Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFC\u2019s equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start.n\nClaim: \"Water rates in Manila, Philippines, \"\"were raised up to 845 percent\"\" when a subsidiary of the World Bank became a partial owner.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Partially true and false. While it is true that water rates in Manila did increase significantly, the claim that rates were raised up to 845 percent specifically when the International Finance Corporation (IFC) became a partial owner is false. The increase in rates was about 170 percent between 2004 and 2012, after the IFC bought its share of the company. However, the IFC played a key role in the privatization plan from the start, which included significant capital investments and rate increases. Therefore, the claim is partially true in terms of the rate increase but false in terms of attributing it solely to the IFC's ownership."}

On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands. '\u201d That story reported: \u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows: In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:  The administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. So the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner. A considerable measure of truth, therefore, exists in the reports published by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Common Dreams.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":2501,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits.
