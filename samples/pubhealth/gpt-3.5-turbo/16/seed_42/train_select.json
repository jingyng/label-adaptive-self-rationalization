Thus, when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the U.S. military living in Mexico after they had been\u00a0deported from the United States (a story we\u00a0previously reported on) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite. However, deported veterans exist, although no one \u2014 not even the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 knows how many. Their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream American consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in Tijuana. \u201cThe Bunker,\u201d also known as the Deported Veterans Support House, is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in Mexico\u2019s border town of Tijuana, and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the United States military, who fought everywhere from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Former Army paratrooper Hector Barajas, 39, opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who, like him, had been deported: \u201cI started The Bunker because there was a need,\u201d Barajas told us. He said since his deportation, he had been meeting others like him living in Tijuana, and discovered that they lived throughout Mexico\u00a0\u2014 but not just Mexico. There are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries, he said. Since then, The Bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause: Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home. We shouldn\u2019t honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for. It may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the United States military does not automatically confer citizenship, but it doesn\u2019t. It can smooth\u00a0the way, provided the aspiring\u00a0citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe. However, it\u2019s not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume (having never been told otherwise) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship, and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait. Sometimes, too, there are bureaucratic foulups. One man was deported after\u00a0he was unable to attend a hearing, despite his reason: he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time. Others do everything the way they\u2019re supposed to, filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings, but still get deported, and no one seems to know\u00a0exactly why. Once they are outside the U.S., they maintain a\u00a0legal right to VA benefits such as healthcare, and to whatever funds they might be entitled, but they have no way of getting back into the United States to obtain that assistance, and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them. Because these particular veterans are either in the United States on green cards or without documentation after their discharges, they can be deported with cause, or for no reason at all. Past and present members of the armed forces\u00a0are supposed to receive special consideration\u00a0during deportation hearings, but the\u00a0guidelines are inconsistently applied. However, some\u00a0of these veterans have\u00a0spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses, which makes their situation more difficult to parse, at least politically. Elected officials (and\u00a0candidates) who might ordinarily be in full-throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers. Sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the American flag\u00a0suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before. Miguel Perez, a United States Army veteran, falls under that category. The 39-year-old Illinois man, who served two tours in Afghanistan and who has been in the U.S. since he was eight, was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008. The green card holder had served half of a 15-year prison sentence when Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement took him for deportation proceedings. After losing an appeal, Perez was deported in March 2018: Perez was flown from Gary, Indiana, to Brownsville, Texas, where officers escorted him across the border and turned him over to Mexican authorities, ICE officials said. Perez appeared shocked by his treatment during his final moments on U.S. soil. An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would \u201cfix this\u201d while leading him to a gate, Perez said. \u201cWhen we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done here,'\u201d he said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally? This is it?\u201d The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to\u00a0return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don\u2019t apply to corpses.

{"claim_id":10533,"hypothesis":"Intensive Vegetable-Fruit Diet Shows No Effect on Breast Cancer Return","date_published":"July 18, 2007","explanation_1":"\"This was a brief story (only 242 words) that accurately described the main findings of an important randomized trial. Specifically, this story discussed a newly published study showing no evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is related to a decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence. These findings are important for breast cancer survivors to know about, but the story did not include adequate context. Further developing the story to include known treatments to prevent recurrence, both medical and behavioral, would have strengthened the story considerably. Including another perspective from an expert in this field would have been helpful in interpeting the results and in addressing this key issue. Other research suggests that weight management via diet and exercise may play a role in the prevention of certain types of breast cancer in post-menopausal women\u00a0 (e.g. hormone receptor negative). The story did mention prevention of excessive weight gain via diet and exercise would be the \"\"next frontier in cancer prevention research\"\". In a similarly designed study recently published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, there was a small (about 6-pound) weight loss difference in the group of women assigned to a high-fiber, low-fat diet, and fewer breast cancer recurrences in this group (though the difference was not statistically significant). The story failed to mention other evidence-based breast cancer recurrence strategies currently available such as hormone and biological medications, etc. These medications can reduce the risk of recurrence by about 50% or more.

{"claim_id":37567,"hypothesis":"\"Players in the online \"\"World of Warcraft\"\" game were hit with an in-game virus, one that was later studied by researchers.\"","date_published":"March 9, 2020","explanation_1":"Was \u2018World of Warcraft\u2019 Once Hit by a Virus That Was Subsequently Studied by Researchers?","fact_checkers":"  Arturo Garcia  ","premise":"As the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus disease) continued to spread in March 2020, social media users flashed back to a \u201cpandemic\u201d that unfolded nearly 20 years earlier \u2014 but this one took place entirely in the virtual world.According to the Hong Kong-based tech news site AbacusNews.com, more people on the Chinese platform Weibo have begun researching the Corrupted Blood online virus and players\u2019 responses to the bug, which broke out inside the World of Warcraft game platform (known as WOW for short) in September 2005:A Weibo hashtag related to the World of Warcraft epidemic has become one of the most-searched terms, reaching nearly 60 million views. And one Weibo influencer spotted a similarity between their origins: The Wuhan coronavirus and Corrupted Blood both started in animals.\u201cOn the fundamental level, Corrupted Blood started with a hunter\u2019s pet, namely an animal, before it transmitted to a person,\u201d the Weibo user wrote.On Twitter, author Rin Chupeco garnered attention by highlighting the incident in a very popular thread and adding, \u201cEpidemiologists actually STUDIED this to see how ppl would react to an epidemic [in real life].\u201dThe Warcraft outbreak was an unintended side-effect of an update to the game involving the character Hakkar the Soulflayer, introduced for players in the online multi-player game to take down to complete a raid. One of Hakkar\u2019s attacks siphoned off players\u2019 characters\u2019 \u201cblood,\u201d weakening them to replenish his own strength. The game allowed for players to contaminate (or \u201ccorrupt\u201d) their characters\u2019 blood and thus poison Hakkar. But the tactic could also affect characters\u2019 in-game pet.Engineers for the game told PC Magazine in 2019 that the problem originated from a mistake by the design team; if a character\u2019s pet was in play at the time they poisoned Hakkar using that maneuver, the corrupted blood effect \u2014 and damage to not only the pet but any other character \u2014 would linger even after completing that part of the game.\u201cEvery time you\u2019d summon that pet you\u2019d reinfect yourself and all the players around you and it wouldn\u2019t check if you were in a raid so you\u2019d do it while you were in town and the entire town would get corrupted,\u201d said Shane Dabiri, chief of staff for the game\u2019s manufacturer Blizzard Entertainment. The effect was further spread by players who willfully \u201cinfected\u201d their characters, and then deliberately took them to other virtual sites on the WOW platform.\u201cEven once we figured out what was going on it made it really, really hard to fix it,\u201d Cash said:Our choices were either to go through every pet in every server in every country in the entire world and check if it had corrupted blood and get rid of it, or get really hacky code in where every time you summoned a pet it would check and see if it had corrupted blood on it and get rid of it.At the time, an estimated 6.5 million players used the game platform. As Reuters would report in 2009, the corrupted blood outbreak, which lasted around a month, affected 4 million of them. But the situation also prompted researchers to take note.In a March 2007 article for the journal Epidemiology,\u00a0physician Ran D. Balicer from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel called the purposeful spread of corrupted blood by WOW players \u201cthe first virtual act of bio-warfare\u201d and drew parallels between that outbreak online and the public spread of other diseases in the real world:The role of an asymptomatic-yet-infective animal reservoir, for instance, is evident in avian influenza. Asymptomatic ducks had an important role in allowing this otherwise relatively lethal avian disease to become endemic in East Asia and spread to other parts of the world. Furthermore, attempts by game administrators to quarantine infected areas proved futile due to the ability of characters to rapidly teleport to distant lands. This is similar to the role of air travel in the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (ie, SARS).That same year, in a paper for Lancet Infectious Diseases, Tufts University professor Nina Fefferman and co-author Eric Lofgren from the University of North Carolina argued that because WOW players can be so immersed in the game, that their reactions could be used as a gauge for how non-gamers could react in the event of a real-world outbreak:The modern world has two distinct types of pathogens, real and virtual. Real pathogens are, logically, those that infect real organisms, many of which subsequently cause disease and become subject to the attentions of the medical and public-health professions. The second type of pathogen, the virtual virus, infects computers through software. The outbreak we have described marks the first time that a virtual virus has infected a virtual human being in a manner even remotely resembling an actual epidemiological event. As technology and biology become more heavily integrated in daily life, this small step towards the interaction of virtual viruses and human beings could become highly significant.More than a decade later, those respective analyses continued to hold true; Eric Lofgren, who as of March 2020 was working as an infectious disease specialist at the Washington State University veterinary teaching hospital, told the Canadian Broadcast Company that implementing planned outbreaks within virtual settings could provide data for how to combat viral diseases outside of them.\u201cIn the real world, we can observe people\u2019s behaviour, but we don\u2019t know everything about the rest of the universe.

And one Weibo influencer spotted a similarity between their origins: The Wuhan coronavirus and Corrupted Blood both started in animals.\u201cOn the fundamental level, Corrupted Blood started with a hunter\u2019s pet, namely an animal, before it transmitted to a person,\u201d the Weibo user wrote.On Twitter, author Rin Chupeco garnered attention by highlighting the incident in a very popular thread and adding, \u201cEpidemiologists actually STUDIED this to see how ppl would react to an epidemic [in real life].\u201dThe Warcraft outbreak was an unintended side-effect of an update to the game involving the character Hakkar the Soulflayer, introduced for players in the online multi-player game to take down to complete a raid. One of Hakkar\u2019s attacks siphoned off players\u2019 characters\u2019 \u201cblood,\u201d weakening them to replenish his own strength. The game allowed for players to contaminate (or \u201ccorrupt\u201d) their characters\u2019 blood and thus poison Hakkar. But the tactic could also affect characters\u2019 in-game pet.Engineers for the game told PC Magazine in 2019 that the problem originated from a mistake by the design team; if a character\u2019s pet was in play at the time they poisoned Hakkar using that maneuver, the corrupted blood effect \u2014 and damage to not only the pet but any other character \u2014 would linger even after completing that part of the game.\u201cEvery time you\u2019d summon that pet you\u2019d reinfect yourself and all the players around you and it wouldn\u2019t check if you were in a raid so you\u2019d do it while you were in town and the entire town would get corrupted,\u201d said Shane Dabiri, chief of staff for the game\u2019s manufacturer Blizzard Entertainment. The effect was further spread by players who willfully \u201cinfected\u201d their characters, and then deliberately took them to other virtual sites on the WOW platform.\u201cEven once we figured out what was going on it made it really, really hard to fix it,\u201d Cash said:Our choices were either to go through every pet in every server in every country in the entire world and check if it had corrupted blood and get rid of it, or get really hacky code in where every time you summoned a pet it would check and see if it had corrupted blood on it and get rid of it.At the time, an estimated 6.5 million players used the game platform. As Reuters would report in 2009, the corrupted blood outbreak, which lasted around a month, affected 4 million of them.

Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\" We won\u2019t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, \u00a0healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these \"\"major\"\" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. If all regulations were counted, Obama\u2019s record would be nowhere near Portman\u2019s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. But Portman said \"\"major\"\" rules.\"\" \"\"Major\"\" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them \"\"economically significant\"\" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to \"\"major\"\" that there is no need to split hairs here. We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. One was provided by Portman\u2019s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. Portman\u2019s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama\u2019s tenure with the first three of Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president\u2019s term. Portman\u2019s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. A similar analysis by George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman\u2019s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama\u2019s first term. This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman\u2019s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"\"major\"\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term.

It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"\"major\"\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term. This doesn\u2019t change the facts or statistics as stated by Portman: The Obama administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\"\"n\nClaim: \"The Obama administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"True.

Also missing from the first-person account was information about whether the product demonstrated signs of tampering. Nair and other hair removal creams have a distinct, overpowering scent similar to sulfur, which is stronger still when it is undiluted.The New Richmond Police Department put out a press release saying they are investigating the incident:On July 28, 2019 The New Richmond Police Department received a complaint of alleged product tampering. A 21 year old female subject indicated she used hair conditioner, recently purchased, and upon using the product for the first time reported immediate significant hair loss on her head. The product was reported to have a different smell and color than the original product. Product tampering can be a felony offense and is cited under Wisconsin State Statute 941.327. Due to the significance of this offense, New Richmond officers and detectives have been working with Wal-Mart staff to identify potential suspects and review video surveillance. The New Richmond Police Department will continue to follow the facts of this case.While this appears to be an isolated case at this time, the New Richmond Police Department is asking anyone in this area that has been a recent victim of this type of activity to please report it immediately to your local police\/sheriff\u2019s department.The New Richmond Police Department is also reminding people to be diligent in checking products for safety seals and prior to any use to make sure it is consistent with the product you are expecting.Some news sites reported on the Facebook post as an isolated incident (\u201cWoman loses hair \u2018in clumps\u2019 after Nair was allegedly mixed into conditioner bought at Walmart\u201d), while others leapt to the conclusion that this was a trend:People Are Now Putting Hair Removal Creme In Shampoo BottlesSomeone had replaced the brand new product with Nair hair removal creme.I remember the rumors about people putting Nair in the conditioner and shampoo bottles of their worst enemies, but this is something entirely worse! Continuing into the post, she claims that she reported the incident to local police, and they are working to watch camera footage from the Walmart, to see if they can get to the bottom of the incident.Warning!

A mother is urging shoppers who purchase products at Walmart to double-check if any of the items have been tampered with before buying them. This after her daughter discovered her conditioner bottle contained Nair inside the product. Nair is a hair removal product that works by breaking the \u201cdisulfide bonds of the keratin molecules in hair\u201d which makes it easier for hair to be wiped away easily without using a razor.As the first of the two sites noted above, claims about contaminating conditioner with hair removal creams like Nair are old urban legends, which does not mean that someone, somewhere has not attempted to execute such a prank. Further, the post alludes to targeting a person in that fashion; as presented, the purported victim in the Facebook posts appeared to have been randomly selected.In the second excerpt, the site made reference to the manner in which Nair and other chemical depilatories function. In contrast with most conditioners (which sit on the hair for one to three minutes), Nair and hair removal creams sit on the skin for five to ten minutes \u2014 or even longer \u2014 to dissolve hair. On their website, Nair provides the following instructions for one product:Smooth on a thick, even layer to cover hair. Leave cream on for 5 minutes.Check a small area for hair removal. If your hair is thick, you may need more time. (Don\u2019t leave on longer than 10 minutes. )Gently wipe off the cream and hair with a damp washcloth. Don\u2019t rub!Rumors about contaminating conditioner (or shampoo) with Nair very likely antedate the internet. However, their plausibility was discussed on the Straight Dope message board back in 2001; forum members provided a laundry list of reasons the prank was impractical. It was cited other forums in undated posts, and appeared in 2010 on a forum for people with long hair. In an unrelated 2010 video, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d prank appeared on YouTube.In 2016, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d rumor was the subject of a viral hoax. In 2018, a Reddit user claimed a disgruntled roommate put hair removal cream in her shampoo, and that same year the likelihood of the prank working was discussed on Quora. On the latter post, a self-identified hairdresser claimed to have witnessed the aftermath of one such incident.In photographs, the woman making the claims appeared to be missing neatly bordered sections of scalp hair, not a diffuse amount throughout her scalp. Conditioner is distributed through hair, and whether strands had been shortened or unevenly dissolved was also not clear from the photographs.In the photograph on the left side of Timm\u2019s post, the conditioner is shown to be a large bottle with a pump, supposedly purchased just two days earlier. Hair removal cream surreptitiously added to the bottle in a Walmart aisle would be situated at the top and unlikely to move to the bottom of the bottle, whereas the pump would retrieve product from the bottom up. If an ill-intentioned shopper decanted hair removal cream into a very large pump bottle of conditioner, it seemed unlikely the affected product would migrate into the pump in the first day or two of use.It is also possible that the uneven distribution was due to a tampered but unshaken product, where pockets of pure \u201cNair\u201d were next to pockets of conditioner. However, massaging the product through hair ought to have diluted the \u201cNair\u201d as well, making it less efficient. Presumably, a then-diluted formula would have sat on the skin for a shorter period of time than five minutes, lowering the possibility of hairless patches.Another issue is that the articles quoted above asserted that \u201cpeople\u201d are \u201cnow putting\u201d hair removal cream in conditioner; we found no other reports of such tampering in the time period during which the reports appeared. We emailed Nair for information about the feasibility of the rumor, but have not yet received a response.In short, a woman claimed that a chemical hair remover\u00a0was added to hair conditioner she purchased at Walmart, leading to hair loss. It is possible that Nair-tainted conditioner caused the hair loss shown here, but it is also possible that the hair loss was due to another reason and that the poster assumed that unexpected loss of hair was because of product tampering. The latter issue\u00a0\u2014 product tampering in a store\u00a0\u2014 had been recently\u00a0reported, making it a possibility that news about product tampering led the woman to conclude that it had also happened to her.We found no additional, similar reports to suggest that the claim indicated a widespread trend.

{"claim_id":38613,"hypothesis":" An open letter to Oxford students demanding that a statute of Oxford benefactor Cecil Rhodes be removed from campus has gone viral. ","date_published":"March 30, 2016","explanation_1":"Oxford Pushes Back Letter About Cecil Rhodes Statute ","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"No author is listed for this open letter to Oxford University students demanding the removal of a Cecil Rhodes statute, and we haven\u2019t been able to verify where it came from. The \u201cRhodes Must Fall\u201d movement gained widespread publicity in early 2016. The Cecil Rhodes statute, which has sat outside a building at Oriel College for more than 100 years, represents racism and colonialism, student activists have argued. According to a Change.org petition started by supporters of the group: We find it deplorable that Oriel College continues to glorify an international criminal through its uncritical, deeply\u00a0violent iconography. As long as the statue remains, Oriel College\u00a0and Oxford University continue to tacitly identify with\u00a0Rhodes\u2019s values, and to maintain a toxic culture of domination and oppression. We believe that the colonialism, racism\u00a0and\u00a0patriarchy this statue is seeped in has no place in our university \u2013 which for many of us is also our home. The\u00a0removal of this statue would be a welcome first step in the University\u2019s\u00a0attempt to redress the ways in which it has\u00a0been an active beneficiary of empire. While it remains standing, the statue of Rhodes remains a celebration not just of\u00a0the crimes of the\u00a0man himself, but of the imperialist legacy on which Oxford University has thrived, and continues to\u00a0thrive. While the statue remains standing, Oxford University continues to\u00a0condone the persistent racism that shadows\u00a0this institution. At issue is Cecil Rhodes\u2019 legacy of British imperialism in South Africa, where he served as prime minister of Cape Colony and enforced racial segregation. Rhodes was intent on \u201cpainting the map red\u201d (a term for British colonization) in Africa, and he even dreamed of reclaiming the American colonies for the British Empire, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. After his political career, Cecil Rhodes became the benefactor of the Rhodes Scholarships. Each year, 32 American students are selected as Rhodes Scholars for \u201ctheir character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.\u201d Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten told student demonstrators in January that Nelson Mendela had endorse the Rhodes scholarships, and that those who were not prepared to embrace freedom of though should \u201cthink about being educated elsewhere,\u201d The Guardian reports: In early February, Oxford University administrators announced that they would not remove the Rhodes statue from campus, despite concerns from student groups. After the Oxford Union backed a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes statute on January 20th, it was later revealed that the statute would remain due to pressure from donors, the Telegraph reports: \u201cI think that we are giving them [the students] the respect of listening to their views, even when we don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he told the\u00a0Today programme on BBC Radio 4. \u201cBut if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards\u00a0Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for\u00a0any undergraduate, Karl Popper\u2019s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about\u00a0being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.\u201d \u201cThat focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in American campuses and British\u00a0campuses,\u201d Patten said. \u201cOne of the points of a university \u2013 which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free\u00a0inquiry and debate \u2013 is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don\u2019t like and talk\u00a0about them and debate them.\u201d He added: \u201cCan you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people,\u00a0it\u2019s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to\u00a0talk about western values, which I regard as glob.\u201d By mid-February, administrators made clear that the Rhodes statute would not be removed. Around that same time, the \u201cOxford Pushes Back\u201d letter to student demonstrators first surfaced on a discussion board called the Daily Gripe, on February 13th. Some of Patten\u2019s quotes are included in the Oxford Pushes Back letter, but there\u2019s no indication that he actually wrote it, or that it came from the university. In the end, there\u2019s no way to tell who the original author was.

After the Oxford Union backed a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes statute on January 20th, it was later revealed that the statute would remain due to pressure from donors, the Telegraph reports: \u201cI think that we are giving them [the students] the respect of listening to their views, even when we don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he told the\u00a0Today programme on BBC Radio 4. \u201cBut if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards\u00a0Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for\u00a0any undergraduate, Karl Popper\u2019s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about\u00a0being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.\u201d \u201cThat focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in American campuses and British\u00a0campuses,\u201d Patten said. \u201cOne of the points of a university \u2013 which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free\u00a0inquiry and debate \u2013 is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don\u2019t like and talk\u00a0about them and debate them.\u201d He added: \u201cCan you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people,\u00a0it\u2019s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to\u00a0talk about western values, which I regard as glob.\u201d By mid-February, administrators made clear that the Rhodes statute would not be removed. Around that same time, the \u201cOxford Pushes Back\u201d letter to student demonstrators first surfaced on a discussion board called the Daily Gripe, on February 13th. Some of Patten\u2019s quotes are included in the Oxford Pushes Back letter, but there\u2019s no indication that he actually wrote it, or that it came from the university. In the end, there\u2019s no way to tell who the original author was.

{"claim_id":34166,"hypothesis":"In October 2019, the Rev. Robert Morey of St. Anthony's parish in Florence, South Carolina, refused former Vice President Joe Biden the Catholic rite of communion.","date_published":"October 30, 2019","explanation_1":"Until and unless we receive information that corroborates Morey\u2019s account.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights. The story was covered by several major national news outlets\u00a0but originated in a statement sent to the Florence Morning News by Robert Morey, a priest in the Catholic parish of St. Anthony in Florence, South Carolina. On Oct. 28, the Morning News reported that: Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church\u2019s 9 a.m. Mass\u2026 \u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Morey told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey added. Asked by Snopes to confirm, deny, or clarify Morey\u2019s account, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment on the story. Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":7484,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights.

{"claim_id":34700,"hypothesis":"\"Disputed parentage of a child born aboard a ship was resolved by listing the newborn as a \"\"son of the gun.\"","date_published":"September 7, 2002","explanation_1":"A more believable postulation for the origin of the term shifts the focus onto the occupation of the father and away from the location of the whelping (which fanciful lore would have us believe was on a deck between two guns, rather than in a cot in an officer\u2019s cabin or in a screened-off corner of the sick bay). In that explanation, \u201cgun\u201d refers to \u201csoldier\u201d (equating arms with the man, as it were), making any soldier\u2019s or sailor\u2019s male child \u2014 conceived in wedlock or not \u2014 a \u201cson of a gun.\u201d Alliteration (repetition of sounds) and well-cadenced rhymes were just as well-loved centuries ago as they are now, thus our forefathers would have delighted in \u201cson of a gun\u2019s\u201d inherent ear appeal in the same way we were slyly pleased by \u201cthe Thrilla in Manila\u201d and \u201cin like Flynn.\u201d","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"The faintly derogative epithet \u201cson of a gun\u201d has been documented as part of the lexicon of the English language since 1708, but no one can really lay claim to knowing how it began or what the phrase originally signified. Numerous interesting backstories have emerged in the centuries since, and it\u2019s possible one might even be the right one, but we no longer have any way of knowing. We can, however, dismiss some of the more fanciful \u201cexplanations\u201d that have come along: We can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above. First, wives and girlfriends (i.e., prostitutes) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time. Can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships, and how many extra rations they\u2019d have had to carry, if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along? And where did these women stay? There was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew (even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once), and women couldn\u2019t be out on deck where they\u2019d interfere with the operation of the ship. Were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time? Yes, some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives, but this happened infrequently at best, making the presence of non-passenger females (pregnant or otherwise) aboard sailing ships unusual. The vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard, thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women\u2019s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed. (Larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck. This is where the crew on such ships would sleep, not amidst the guns on the gun deck.) Second, we should look askance at the claim that when in port, and with the crew restricted to the ship, women typically gave birth aboard ship. Crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports, which we can fairly assume their home berths were not. And even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew (either to desertion or drunkenness) if they were let off the ship, the wives were under no such restrictions. Not being necessary to the running of the ship, nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth. Their husbands not only wouldn\u2019t accompany this hypothetical exodus, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to even if they could. In the era of sailing ships, the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now \u2014 dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on, but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere, and the farther away the better. Bringing babies into the world was considered wholly the province of women (doctors were summoned only if matters had taken a decidedly bad turn, and even then only rarely), and men were present at such events only when it could not otherwise be avoided. Men certainly did not voluntarily insert themselves into the proceedings, nor would their presence have been welcomed by the women straining to bring children into the world, the midwives attending them, and the array of female relatives that inevitably gathered by the bedside. Third, although a certain convoluted train of logic might tie the firing of large guns to hastening a difficult birth (e.g., inspiration by example, a cornerstone of sympathetic magic), there\u2019s no reason to believe anyone living in those times even tried this, let alone that the practice was so widespread that the firing of guns to ease childbirth begat a distinct phrase. Histories of life in the 1700s and 1800s are thunderous in their silence about this practice, and it can safely be assumed that quiet reflects a stunning truth about the matter \u2014 that whatever tales we\u2019re now telling ourselves, cannonfire wasn\u2019t being used to hasten babies into the world. Granted, gunfire had been employed in distant times to fend off disease (it never worked), so there is some historical basis for a tie between the discharge of firearms and medical emergencies. During the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia, many took to firing muskets both in the street and indoors under the mistaken assumption that introducing the acrid fumes of burnt gunpowder into the air would kill off the mysterious illness daily making away with hundreds of citizens. Such practice was even recommended by the city\u2019s government, so this wasn\u2019t even a case of a few badly-educated members of the populace seizing upon a fanciful notion; at the time it appeared to have the backing of the scientific community. However, it was the fumes of the spent gunpowder, not the report of the guns, that was supposed to effect the cure. In the realm of superstition, sudden noise is espoused as a way to drive away evil (we toll wedding bells for this purpose, and the New Year\u2019s Eve hullabaloo springs from that same wellspring of belief), but there is only one reported tie in that area of study between abrupt racket and the induction of labor, and it involves the ringing of church bells.

Numerous interesting backstories have emerged in the centuries since, and it\u2019s possible one might even be the right one, but we no longer have any way of knowing. We can, however, dismiss some of the more fanciful \u201cexplanations\u201d that have come along: We can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above. First, wives and girlfriends (i.e., prostitutes) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time. Can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships, and how many extra rations they\u2019d have had to carry, if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along? And where did these women stay? There was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew (even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once), and women couldn\u2019t be out on deck where they\u2019d interfere with the operation of the ship. Were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time? Yes, some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives, but this happened infrequently at best, making the presence of non-passenger females (pregnant or otherwise) aboard sailing ships unusual. The vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard, thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women\u2019s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed. (Larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck. This is where the crew on such ships would sleep, not amidst the guns on the gun deck.) Second, we should look askance at the claim that when in port, and with the crew restricted to the ship, women typically gave birth aboard ship. Crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports, which we can fairly assume their home berths were not. And even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew (either to desertion or drunkenness) if they were let off the ship, the wives were under no such restrictions. Not being necessary to the running of the ship, nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth. Their husbands not only wouldn\u2019t accompany this hypothetical exodus, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to even if they could. In the era of sailing ships, the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now \u2014 dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on, but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere, and the farther away the better. Bringing babies into the world was considered wholly the province of women (doctors were summoned only if matters had taken a decidedly bad turn, and even then only rarely), and men were present at such events only when it could not otherwise be avoided. Men certainly did not voluntarily insert themselves into the proceedings, nor would their presence have been welcomed by the women straining to bring children into the world, the midwives attending them, and the array of female relatives that inevitably gathered by the bedside. Third, although a certain convoluted train of logic might tie the firing of large guns to hastening a difficult birth (e.g., inspiration by example, a cornerstone of sympathetic magic), there\u2019s no reason to believe anyone living in those times even tried this, let alone that the practice was so widespread that the firing of guns to ease childbirth begat a distinct phrase. Histories of life in the 1700s and 1800s are thunderous in their silence about this practice, and it can safely be assumed that quiet reflects a stunning truth about the matter \u2014 that whatever tales we\u2019re now telling ourselves, cannonfire wasn\u2019t being used to hasten babies into the world. Granted, gunfire had been employed in distant times to fend off disease (it never worked), so there is some historical basis for a tie between the discharge of firearms and medical emergencies. During the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia, many took to firing muskets both in the street and indoors under the mistaken assumption that introducing the acrid fumes of burnt gunpowder into the air would kill off the mysterious illness daily making away with hundreds of citizens. Such practice was even recommended by the city\u2019s government, so this wasn\u2019t even a case of a few badly-educated members of the populace seizing upon a fanciful notion; at the time it appeared to have the backing of the scientific community. However, it was the fumes of the spent gunpowder, not the report of the guns, that was supposed to effect the cure. In the realm of superstition, sudden noise is espoused as a way to drive away evil (we toll wedding bells for this purpose, and the New Year\u2019s Eve hullabaloo springs from that same wellspring of belief), but there is only one reported tie in that area of study between abrupt racket and the induction of labor, and it involves the ringing of church bells. Rather, the canon of superstition advises the loosening and opening of items to assist during a difficult childbirth: windows are to be flung open, doors unlocked, and shoelaces undone to help the impending mother in her travails. Nothing in superstition, however, advises frightening women into giving birth, much less introducing roaring cannons into the procedure.

A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman\u2019s 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy\u2019s chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny. Yet another, similar claim was disproven after experts said that\u00a0Mountain Dew\u00a0(and other soft drinks)\u00a0could dissolve a mouse, thanks to the acids that incorporated into their flavoring agents to give them a tanginess and bite.

A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman\u2019s 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy\u2019s chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny. Yet another, similar claim was disproven after experts said that\u00a0Mountain Dew\u00a0(and other soft drinks)\u00a0could dissolve a mouse, thanks to the acids that incorporated into their flavoring agents to give them a tanginess and bite. In this case, the rat depicted appeared merely to be drowned, but in no way visibly decomposed.n\nClaim: A Texas man found a dead rat in a partially consumed bottle of Dr Pepper.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Based on the evidence provided, the claim that a Texas man found a dead rat in a partially consumed bottle of Dr Pepper is not enough information to confirm.

The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene.The folks in the lab finally figured out what it was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise. It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields. Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners. The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver\u2019s remains were not recovered; however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.

Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000.

The burden is on Murtaugh, Trump\u2019s top campaign spokesman, to provide broad evidence of his unqualified claim. He comes up short.\"","fact_checkers":"Warren Fiske","premise":"\"Are COVID-19 business restrictions causing U.S. suicides to soar? Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, made that claim during a May 26 interview on Newsradio WRVA in Richmond. Murtaugh has deep Richmond connections, having worked in the city as television reporter and as a spokesman for the Republican Party of Virginia, former Attorney General Jerry Kilgore and several statewide GOP campaigns. Lately, he\u2019s been a regular guest on conservative Virginia radio shows, giving updates on Trump\u2019s campaign. On May 26, Murtaugh defended Trump\u2019s demands to reopen the economy, saying the shutdown is causing its own death toll. \"\"You cannot shut the economy down and have it be dormant for an extended period of time,\"\" he said. \"\"That comes with significant health risks of its own; known health problems that we will get, never mind that we see suicide rates skyrocketing now because people are in despair, and some of that is economic pressure on people. We know that to be the case. So we have to get our economy moving again.\"\" Fact checking Murtaugh\u2019s claim, we found that mental health experts are deeply concerned that the sharp economic downturn could lead to more suicides - particularly if there is a long period of high unemployment. But there is no broad evidence that U.S. suicides have increased this year, let alone skyrocketed, as Muraugh says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps national suicide statistics, a lengthy process that requires verification of reported self-inflicted deaths. The latest data is from 2018 - more than a year before the first COVID-19 death occurred in the U.S. Suicide statistics for this year will be ready in 2022. \"\"It\u2019s too soon to know whether COVID-19 is associated with suicide increases,\"\" Courtney Lenard, a CDC spokesperson, told us. \"\"There is no evidence that suicide rates are increasing,\"\" said Jerry Reed, senior vice president of the Education Development Center, a global nonprofit that studies suicide and other mental health issues. Murtuagh\u2019s backup We asked Murtaugh for proof of his claim, and he sent us three anecdotal news stories. A May 21 TV report from KGO in San Francisco featuring Dr. Mike deBoisblanc, head of the trauma department at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, Calif. He called for an end to coronavirus quarantining, saying he\u2019d seen \"\"a year's worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.\"\" A May 25 TV report from KIMA in Yakima, Wash., saying the county has seen seven suicides in the last 10 weeks - a 30% over the same time last year. \"\"I can't speculate to the reason why,\"\" said Coroner Jim Curtice. An April 29 article from the Daily News in New York saying there had been 16 suicides in the borough during the last six weeks. In comparison, there were 17 suicides in Queens during the first four months of 2019. \"\"\"\"There is a mental health component to this health crisis,\"\" said Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz. Murtaugh also sent us articles from The Washington Post and U.S. News & World Report with an array of mental health experts voicing concern that the poor economy and social distancing brought on by COVID-19 could cause increased depression and anxiety leading to suicides. Neither article said, however, that suicides have increased this year, and both articles quoted experts hoping no surge will come. \"\"Could the numbers go up? Yes, but it isn\u2019t inevitable. We know suicide is preventable,\"\" said Christine Moutier, chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told The Post. Research has shown a connection between extended periods of high unemployment and suicide. A Rutgers University study of the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 found that for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate, there was a 1.6% in the suicide rate. Reed told us that calls to national suicide hotliness have increased in recent months, but said he\u2019s hopeful that\u2019s a good sign that more people are seeking counseling. Our ruling \"\"You see suicide rates skyrocketing now,\"\" Murtaugh said, in amplifying Trump\u2019s call for an end to COVID-19 business restrictions that have hurt the economy. He addresses a subject of great concern because suicide rates historically have gone up when there were prolonged increases in unemployment rates. But Murtaugh is way ahead of himself.

Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, made that claim during a May 26 interview on Newsradio WRVA in Richmond. Murtaugh has deep Richmond connections, having worked in the city as television reporter and as a spokesman for the Republican Party of Virginia, former Attorney General Jerry Kilgore and several statewide GOP campaigns. Lately, he\u2019s been a regular guest on conservative Virginia radio shows, giving updates on Trump\u2019s campaign. On May 26, Murtaugh defended Trump\u2019s demands to reopen the economy, saying the shutdown is causing its own death toll. \"\"You cannot shut the economy down and have it be dormant for an extended period of time,\"\" he said. \"\"That comes with significant health risks of its own; known health problems that we will get, never mind that we see suicide rates skyrocketing now because people are in despair, and some of that is economic pressure on people. We know that to be the case. So we have to get our economy moving again.\"\" Fact checking Murtaugh\u2019s claim, we found that mental health experts are deeply concerned that the sharp economic downturn could lead to more suicides - particularly if there is a long period of high unemployment. But there is no broad evidence that U.S. suicides have increased this year, let alone skyrocketed, as Muraugh says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps national suicide statistics, a lengthy process that requires verification of reported self-inflicted deaths. The latest data is from 2018 - more than a year before the first COVID-19 death occurred in the U.S. Suicide statistics for this year will be ready in 2022. \"\"It\u2019s too soon to know whether COVID-19 is associated with suicide increases,\"\" Courtney Lenard, a CDC spokesperson, told us. \"\"There is no evidence that suicide rates are increasing,\"\" said Jerry Reed, senior vice president of the Education Development Center, a global nonprofit that studies suicide and other mental health issues. Murtuagh\u2019s backup We asked Murtaugh for proof of his claim, and he sent us three anecdotal news stories. A May 21 TV report from KGO in San Francisco featuring Dr. Mike deBoisblanc, head of the trauma department at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, Calif. He called for an end to coronavirus quarantining, saying he\u2019d seen \"\"a year's worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.\"\" A May 25 TV report from KIMA in Yakima, Wash., saying the county has seen seven suicides in the last 10 weeks - a 30% over the same time last year. \"\"I can't speculate to the reason why,\"\" said Coroner Jim Curtice. An April 29 article from the Daily News in New York saying there had been 16 suicides in the borough during the last six weeks. In comparison, there were 17 suicides in Queens during the first four months of 2019. \"\"\"\"There is a mental health component to this health crisis,\"\" said Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz. Murtaugh also sent us articles from The Washington Post and U.S. News & World Report with an array of mental health experts voicing concern that the poor economy and social distancing brought on by COVID-19 could cause increased depression and anxiety leading to suicides. Neither article said, however, that suicides have increased this year, and both articles quoted experts hoping no surge will come. \"\"Could the numbers go up? Yes, but it isn\u2019t inevitable. We know suicide is preventable,\"\" said Christine Moutier, chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told The Post. Research has shown a connection between extended periods of high unemployment and suicide. A Rutgers University study of the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 found that for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate, there was a 1.6% in the suicide rate. Reed told us that calls to national suicide hotliness have increased in recent months, but said he\u2019s hopeful that\u2019s a good sign that more people are seeking counseling. Our ruling \"\"You see suicide rates skyrocketing now,\"\" Murtaugh said, in amplifying Trump\u2019s call for an end to COVID-19 business restrictions that have hurt the economy. He addresses a subject of great concern because suicide rates historically have gone up when there were prolonged increases in unemployment rates. But Murtaugh is way ahead of himself. There\u2019s no way to know whether suicides are rising this coronavirus year - let alone \"\"skyrocketing\"\" - because national statistics aren\u2019t available and won\u2019t be for some time. The burden is on Murtaugh, Trump\u2019s top campaign spokesman, to provide broad evidence of his unqualified claim. He comes up short.\"n\nClaim: \u201cYou see suicide rates are skyrocketing now\u2026\u201d\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that \"You see suicide rates are skyrocketing now...\" is false. The evidence provided shows that there is no broad evidence that U.S. suicides have increased this year, let alone skyrocketed. The latest suicide data available is from 2018, and there is no current evidence to support the claim that suicide rates are skyrocketing. Therefore, the claim is false."}

I am not revealing my personal iMessages and sources of messages I get via Facebook to you or anyone else.As observed by the commenter, the information was suspiciously without a source. Its content was also structured in passive voice, asserting \u201cit has been reported\u201d (but not by whom) and adding the more nebulous \u201capparently reports [said. ]\u201dThe claim appeared to be yet another variation on a previously viral (and completely false) claim that antifa protesters were being \u201cbused\u201d into Ada, Oklahoma:Were Four Busloads of Protesters (or \u2018Antifa\u2019) in Ada, Oklahoma Met by \u2018600 Armed Americans,\u2019 \u2014 and the News Won\u2019t Report It?Kowalczyk maintained the antifa U-Haul rumor would not be reported by \u201cmainstream news\u201d sources, an element in common with the above \u201cbusloads of protesters\u201d rumor. That particular claim was embedded in both rumors, providing an immediate suggestion that an absence of verification or credible source was due not to it being a falsehood, but some sort of media conspiracy to suppress brewing \u201cattacks.\u201dInherent Risks, Coded Language, and No Clear PointAs commenters observed, the rumor had another innate risk \u2014 U-Haul trucks are generally used by individuals or families during a residential move.On top of that, anyone arriving in a U-Haul truck to a new neighborhood was likely to, at that point, be unknown to their new neighbors. By suggesting that strangers in U-Hauls were \u201cplanning attacks on residential neighborhoods,\u201d the rumor posed a risk to any innocent people who just happened to be moving at the time it spread.A longer post which mentioned the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor demonstrated how anyone who was unlucky enough to be driving a U-Haul in late June and early July 2020 was at risk due to the rumor, and it mentioned a concurrent false rumor about anti-fascist protesters, Gettysburg, and July 4th 2020:ANTIFA PLAN:\ufffc 30,000 members per state\u2026many trained by radical Islam they plan on killing as many Trump supporters and whites as possible! !ANTIFA To Desecrate Gettysburg National Cemetery on July 4 [2020]- Then MURDER & BURN White Suburbs under cover of \u201cFireworks\u201d[\u2026]Side note: In VA, Jonesey adding a confirmation to this post. [On June 28 2020] at his local firework stand that has been at the same spot for years\u2026there was a semi truck delivery, at which point Uhaul trucks from all over where loading up.The claim also referenced \u201cresidential neighborhoods,\u201d which was puzzling. Any area zoned for homes and apartments was a \u201cresidential neighborhood,\u201d but people expressing concerns sparked by rumors like these appeared to think it was specifically about\u00a0their neighborhoods, all across the United States.It was clear from comments on the post that the rumor was causing significant fear, but aside from \u201cattacks,\u201d the post didn\u2019t provide any clear objective. It merely stated that \u201cantifa\u201d rented U-Hauls en masse, and left sharers to fill in the details with their imaginations.Judging by the rumor\u2019s traction, the strategy was highly effective.A First Wave of the Same RumorTwitter nuisance and Pizzagate pusher Jack Posobiec\u00a0made a point of\u00a0mentioning vague and unsourced \u201cintelligence\u201d received by police in New York and Washington, DC about the use of U-Hauls on June 2 2020:UPDATE: Now DC is receiving intelligence about U-Haul trucks connected to suspected weapons stashes around the city\u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) June 2, 2020It\u2019s Going Down\u00a0tweeted about the rumors on the same day, citing a Fox News article with dubious information:Neo-Nazi groups, already shut down by Twitter, promoted on social media the lie that \"\"ANTIFA\"\" was going to come into suburban \"\"white hoods\"\" to riot and attack people.

Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa.

Its content was also structured in passive voice, asserting \u201cit has been reported\u201d (but not by whom) and adding the more nebulous \u201capparently reports [said. ]\u201dThe claim appeared to be yet another variation on a previously viral (and completely false) claim that antifa protesters were being \u201cbused\u201d into Ada, Oklahoma:Were Four Busloads of Protesters (or \u2018Antifa\u2019) in Ada, Oklahoma Met by \u2018600 Armed Americans,\u2019 \u2014 and the News Won\u2019t Report It?Kowalczyk maintained the antifa U-Haul rumor would not be reported by \u201cmainstream news\u201d sources, an element in common with the above \u201cbusloads of protesters\u201d rumor. That particular claim was embedded in both rumors, providing an immediate suggestion that an absence of verification or credible source was due not to it being a falsehood, but some sort of media conspiracy to suppress brewing \u201cattacks.\u201dInherent Risks, Coded Language, and No Clear PointAs commenters observed, the rumor had another innate risk \u2014 U-Haul trucks are generally used by individuals or families during a residential move.On top of that, anyone arriving in a U-Haul truck to a new neighborhood was likely to, at that point, be unknown to their new neighbors. By suggesting that strangers in U-Hauls were \u201cplanning attacks on residential neighborhoods,\u201d the rumor posed a risk to any innocent people who just happened to be moving at the time it spread.A longer post which mentioned the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor demonstrated how anyone who was unlucky enough to be driving a U-Haul in late June and early July 2020 was at risk due to the rumor, and it mentioned a concurrent false rumor about anti-fascist protesters, Gettysburg, and July 4th 2020:ANTIFA PLAN:\ufffc 30,000 members per state\u2026many trained by radical Islam they plan on killing as many Trump supporters and whites as possible! !ANTIFA To Desecrate Gettysburg National Cemetery on July 4 [2020]- Then MURDER & BURN White Suburbs under cover of \u201cFireworks\u201d[\u2026]Side note: In VA, Jonesey adding a confirmation to this post. [On June 28 2020] at his local firework stand that has been at the same spot for years\u2026there was a semi truck delivery, at which point Uhaul trucks from all over where loading up.The claim also referenced \u201cresidential neighborhoods,\u201d which was puzzling. Any area zoned for homes and apartments was a \u201cresidential neighborhood,\u201d but people expressing concerns sparked by rumors like these appeared to think it was specifically about\u00a0their neighborhoods, all across the United States.It was clear from comments on the post that the rumor was causing significant fear, but aside from \u201cattacks,\u201d the post didn\u2019t provide any clear objective. It merely stated that \u201cantifa\u201d rented U-Hauls en masse, and left sharers to fill in the details with their imaginations.Judging by the rumor\u2019s traction, the strategy was highly effective.A First Wave of the Same RumorTwitter nuisance and Pizzagate pusher Jack Posobiec\u00a0made a point of\u00a0mentioning vague and unsourced \u201cintelligence\u201d received by police in New York and Washington, DC about the use of U-Hauls on June 2 2020:UPDATE: Now DC is receiving intelligence about U-Haul trucks connected to suspected weapons stashes around the city\u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) June 2, 2020It\u2019s Going Down\u00a0tweeted about the rumors on the same day, citing a Fox News article with dubious information:Neo-Nazi groups, already shut down by Twitter, promoted on social media the lie that \"\"ANTIFA\"\" was going to come into suburban \"\"white hoods\"\" to riot and attack people. Now this lie is being promoted at #FoxNews. Egregious example of misinformation and manipulation. pic.twitter.com\/mrBXhyeb37\u2014 It's Going Down (@IGD_News) June 2, 2020@IGD_News referenced a June 2 2020 Fox News article\u00a0(\u201cAntifa arrests coming, concerns over riots heading to suburbia, government source says\u201d) which essentially served as an in-print version of the same rumor. Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa. Two days later, Twitter nuisance Jack Posobiec and Fox News spread iterations of the claim; predictably, no such \u201cinvasion\u201d came to pass. A similar and likely directly related rumor circulated about \u201cantifa buses\u201d in Ada, Oklahoma, and it too was false. In particular, the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor posed a risk to customers of U-Haul, who were at risk specifically if they were moving into a new neighborhood where the rumor had taken root.Comments\"n\nClaim: \"Antifa is renting U-Hauls to quietly infiltrate \"\"residential neighborhoods\"\" for \"\"attacks.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that Antifa is renting U-Hauls to infiltrate residential neighborhoods for attacks is false. The evidence provided indicates that the rumor originated from a fake anti-fascist Twitter account linked to white supremacists and accelerationists. The claim was spread without any credible sources or evidence, and no actual attacks by Antifa involving U-Hauls in residential neighborhoods have occurred. Therefore, the claim is false."}

And would that sort of test actually tell us anything about the safety of the bottled water? First, a word about EPA the standards and how mountain-top mining works. This form of mining relies on explosives to expose coal seams in far southwest Virginia and West Virginia. The controlled explosions generate huge piles of debris that often bury nearby valleys. In April 2010 the EPA said \"\"the resulting waste that then fills valleys and streams can significantly compromise water quality, often causing permanent damage to ecosystems and rendering streams unfit for swimming, fishing and drinking.\"\" The agency established a new purity standard for streams near coal mining areas, saying it was updating provisions of the Clean Water Act to set new conductivity levels. Conductivity is a measurement of how well water transmits an electrical charge and gives a reading on the amount of dissolved solids in water.

She told us conductivity is a \"\"really inexpensive way to see if you have a lot of constituents in water.\"\" In coal-mining regions, she said, conductivity is correlated with sulfate. Pyrite, a mineral made up of coal and sulphur ions, is found in coal seams and filters into water. She said if water near coal mines has high conductivity, it usually contains a lot of sulfates and metals. Streams in mining areas often show elevated sulfur levels, as well as higher levels of iron, selenium and manganese. But the test is designed solely for rural Appalachia, not for use \u00a0across the country. In urban areas, for example, high conductivity may occur when road salt is washed into streams. So how do Perrier and Evian seep into this debate? Beth Breeding, Griffith\u2019s press secretary, told us the congressman\u2019s comments were based on the EPA\u2019s conductivity guidance. But the EPA website makes no mention of Perrier or other bottled waters. Griffith\u2019s claim appears to come from Alpha Natural Resources, the nation\u2019s third-largest coal mining company. A PowerPoint slide circulated by the company says Evian, Perrier and San Pellegrino would all fail EPA conductivity tests. We asked Rick Nida, a spokesman for Alpha, whether his company thinks the EPA test is a fair way to evaluate the impact of mountain-top mining. \"\"We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good standard to use,\"\" he said. \"\"The point is rules are so stringent that bottle water doesn\u2019t pass.

We tested the conductivity of distilled water, Evian, Perrier, Pellegrino and, last of all, a sample taken from the James River in downtown Richmond. Here were our test results: So the bottled water has a conductivity level higher than the EPA\u2019s 500 microSiemens threshold. We asked Bernhardt and Bukaveckas if that is a relevant piece of information. Bukaveckas, the VCU biologist, said the argument reminds him of those raised 20 years ago by power companies disputing the impact -- or even existence -- of acid rain. \"\"They\u2019d point to lakes and say, \u2018These are naturally acidic.\u2019 But if you did water tests, you\u2019d find that undamaged lakes were acidic because of organic or naturally occurring acids,\"\" he said. The damaged lakes, in contrast, contained acids created by emissions from the smokestacks of power plants. Bernhardt, of Duke, said water is different in each environment, making a comparison between French springs and Appalachian streams pointless. \"\"The EPA\u2019s data find that high conductivity is most closely correlated with the loss of species,\"\" Bernhardt said about Appalachian water. \"\"Salty water makes it harder for freshwater fish to live.

Although the quote in the meme was attributed to a legitimate publication, the briefest and most cursory research shows that it appears nowhere in the book cited.","fact_checkers":"Dan Evon","premise":"In June 2017, a persistent hoax involving a falsified quote, supposedly from Nazi leader Adolf Hitler about how he would start World War III even after his death, began to recirculate in meme form:  This passage is frequently shared in defense of Hitler to bolster the argument that he was actually not racist, and, in fact, that he believed black people were the \u201ctrue Hebrews\u201d. The first iteration of this text we could uncover was\u00a0published on a clickbait web site called\u00a0FMLGoneViral.com\u00a0on 7 July 2015: Hitler said even in his death he will start World War 3. One of his soliders asked how? Hitler replied, \u201cThe day mankind finds out what I was trying to defend this nation, Germany, from then thats the day World War 3 will start. For on that day, mankind will learn that I was trying to save my Nation from The Free Masons, the Illuminati, the jews. For if the Americans wins the war, then they will conquer the world and forever be a slave to the jews and they will try to conquer God. Do you know who America has in its posession? \u201cNO,\u201d the solider replied. The Americans has the jewels of God. The Americans have stolen God\u2019s precious jewels. \u201cWhat do you mean his precious jewels?\u201d THE SOLIDER asked. Hitler said, \u201cAmerica has stolen the jews. The Jews of God. His jewelry. The negros. They are the true hebrews. What a foolish move and a direct challenge to God. And they plan on moving these false white jews into a state of Israel. America is desperate in its attempt to win this war using atom bombs on Japan. America will destroy the whole world in its attempt to conquer it. When America and its jewish slave masters conquer the world and the world realize I was right, then all nations will begin a third world war to dethrone America of its rule. Every nation will soon possess atom bombs of their own. It will be the end of most of the world as we know it. \u201cWhy will the jews control America?\u201d the solider asked Hitler said, \u201cbecause the white jews knows that the negros are the real children of Israel. And to keep Americas secret, the jews will blackmail America. The jews will extort America Their plan for world domination wont work if the negros knew who they were. The white citizens of America will be terrified to know that all this time they\u2019ve been mistreating and discriminating and lynching the childen of Israel. They will fear God will destroy them as he destroyed Egypt for doing the same thing. So the elite, the Illuminati keeps this a secret at all cost. After I die, I will one day cause World War 3 just by this message which will be like planting a seed in people minds until it sprouts once they nurture that seed and seek more truth and learn Hitler was right. I did the world a favor by killing the false jews before they designated a false state of Israel. But I fear I have failed. The world will fall into the hands of Satan. Although\u00a0the clickbait site\u00a0provided no citation for when Hitler allegedly made these statements, commenters on the page directed those curious about the quote\u2019s authenticity to the book The Nazis World War II by Robert Edwin Herstein. Other dubious sites immediately picked up on this claim and uncritically re-shared the completely bogus Adolf Hitler quote along with its alleged source \u2014 clearly without doing even the barest minimum of research, such as opening the book in which the quote supposedly appears. Needless to say,, this passage does not appear in Herzstein\u2019s book. We could not find this passage in either the digital copy available via Google Books,\u00a0nor the hard copy we examined. Page 132 of Herzstein\u2019s book The Nazis\u00a0features a photograph of Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and others watching a propaganda film, a description of what this film depicted, as well as a few stills from the production:  The page, like the rest of the book, does not contain an argument suggesting that Adolf Hitler was not racist (given his actions in the historical record, a case for his lack of prejudice would be difficult to make indeed) or that he was kind toward black people. (The hoax quote also appears to miss that racism can exist toward different ethnic groups.) Instead, it describes a propaganda film that linked Jewish people to other groups \u2014\u00a0including black people:\u00a0 Goebbels and Hitler personally appraise a new German movie. When the Fuhrer complained that the films espousing the Nazi line were too scarce, Goebbels rushed a pair of anti-semitic pictures into production. In one segment of a Nazi \u201cInstructional\u201d film (right), the genetic heritage of the Jew is purportedly traced to Oriental, Negro, Near Asian and Hamitic peoples. Hence, the film concludes, \u201cthe Jew is a bastard.\u201d Below, the villainous title character of Jud Suss, a violently anti-Semitic melodrama, spins chemes with his crony, Rabbi Loew. MOVIES HINTING AT HORRORS TO COME To Joseph Goebbels, films were \u201cone of the most modern and scientific means of influencing the masses\u201d Though the German film industry remained largely in private hands, every movie needed the imprimatur of the Propaganda Ministry before it reached the screen, and Goebbels became notorious for meddling with scripts, directors, and actors. In 1938, he set movie studios to work producing anti-Jewish films. In addition, a special team was assembled at the ministry itself to undertake a project called\u00a0The Eternal Jew. The result, a virulent 45-minute harangue billed as a documentary, was shown to audiences throughout Europe. The film featured a lingering look at kosher animal slaughter, imputing sadism and bloodthirstiness to the \u201cJewish race.\u201d Jews were likened to rats and other vermin: \u201cThey carry disease,\u201d warned the narration. Such films, which depicted the Jews as a plague to be eradicated, hinted darkly at the real-life horrors to come. The propaganda film described in this book attempted to trace Jewish ancestry to other groups of people, most likely to demonize other cultures outside of the Aryan race \u2014 not to absolve any groups or make anti-racist arguments. An article published by the United States Holocaust Museum explained that although black people were not targeted in the same way as Jews, they were still persecuted, and Germany produced propaganda that painted black soldiers as chronic rapists and a threat to the \u201cpurity\u201d of the German race:\u00a0 The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups. [\u2026] Following World War I and the\u00a0Treaty of Versailles\u00a0(1919), the victorious Allies occupied the Rhineland in western Germany. The use of French colonial troops, some of whom were black, in these occupation forces exacerbated anti-black racism in Germany.

The first iteration of this text we could uncover was\u00a0published on a clickbait web site called\u00a0FMLGoneViral.com\u00a0on 7 July 2015: Hitler said even in his death he will start World War 3. One of his soliders asked how? Hitler replied, \u201cThe day mankind finds out what I was trying to defend this nation, Germany, from then thats the day World War 3 will start. For on that day, mankind will learn that I was trying to save my Nation from The Free Masons, the Illuminati, the jews. For if the Americans wins the war, then they will conquer the world and forever be a slave to the jews and they will try to conquer God. Do you know who America has in its posession? \u201cNO,\u201d the solider replied. The Americans has the jewels of God. The Americans have stolen God\u2019s precious jewels. \u201cWhat do you mean his precious jewels?\u201d THE SOLIDER asked. Hitler said, \u201cAmerica has stolen the jews. The Jews of God. His jewelry. The negros. They are the true hebrews. What a foolish move and a direct challenge to God. And they plan on moving these false white jews into a state of Israel. America is desperate in its attempt to win this war using atom bombs on Japan. America will destroy the whole world in its attempt to conquer it. When America and its jewish slave masters conquer the world and the world realize I was right, then all nations will begin a third world war to dethrone America of its rule. Every nation will soon possess atom bombs of their own. It will be the end of most of the world as we know it. \u201cWhy will the jews control America?\u201d the solider asked Hitler said, \u201cbecause the white jews knows that the negros are the real children of Israel. And to keep Americas secret, the jews will blackmail America. The jews will extort America Their plan for world domination wont work if the negros knew who they were. The white citizens of America will be terrified to know that all this time they\u2019ve been mistreating and discriminating and lynching the childen of Israel. They will fear God will destroy them as he destroyed Egypt for doing the same thing. So the elite, the Illuminati keeps this a secret at all cost. After I die, I will one day cause World War 3 just by this message which will be like planting a seed in people minds until it sprouts once they nurture that seed and seek more truth and learn Hitler was right. I did the world a favor by killing the false jews before they designated a false state of Israel. But I fear I have failed. The world will fall into the hands of Satan. Although\u00a0the clickbait site\u00a0provided no citation for when Hitler allegedly made these statements, commenters on the page directed those curious about the quote\u2019s authenticity to the book The Nazis World War II by Robert Edwin Herstein. Other dubious sites immediately picked up on this claim and uncritically re-shared the completely bogus Adolf Hitler quote along with its alleged source \u2014 clearly without doing even the barest minimum of research, such as opening the book in which the quote supposedly appears. Needless to say,, this passage does not appear in Herzstein\u2019s book. We could not find this passage in either the digital copy available via Google Books,\u00a0nor the hard copy we examined. Page 132 of Herzstein\u2019s book The Nazis\u00a0features a photograph of Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and others watching a propaganda film, a description of what this film depicted, as well as a few stills from the production:  The page, like the rest of the book, does not contain an argument suggesting that Adolf Hitler was not racist (given his actions in the historical record, a case for his lack of prejudice would be difficult to make indeed) or that he was kind toward black people. (The hoax quote also appears to miss that racism can exist toward different ethnic groups.) Instead, it describes a propaganda film that linked Jewish people to other groups \u2014\u00a0including black people:\u00a0 Goebbels and Hitler personally appraise a new German movie. When the Fuhrer complained that the films espousing the Nazi line were too scarce, Goebbels rushed a pair of anti-semitic pictures into production. In one segment of a Nazi \u201cInstructional\u201d film (right), the genetic heritage of the Jew is purportedly traced to Oriental, Negro, Near Asian and Hamitic peoples. Hence, the film concludes, \u201cthe Jew is a bastard.\u201d Below, the villainous title character of Jud Suss, a violently anti-Semitic melodrama, spins chemes with his crony, Rabbi Loew. MOVIES HINTING AT HORRORS TO COME To Joseph Goebbels, films were \u201cone of the most modern and scientific means of influencing the masses\u201d Though the German film industry remained largely in private hands, every movie needed the imprimatur of the Propaganda Ministry before it reached the screen, and Goebbels became notorious for meddling with scripts, directors, and actors. In 1938, he set movie studios to work producing anti-Jewish films. In addition, a special team was assembled at the ministry itself to undertake a project called\u00a0The Eternal Jew. The result, a virulent 45-minute harangue billed as a documentary, was shown to audiences throughout Europe. The film featured a lingering look at kosher animal slaughter, imputing sadism and bloodthirstiness to the \u201cJewish race.\u201d Jews were likened to rats and other vermin: \u201cThey carry disease,\u201d warned the narration. Such films, which depicted the Jews as a plague to be eradicated, hinted darkly at the real-life horrors to come. The propaganda film described in this book attempted to trace Jewish ancestry to other groups of people, most likely to demonize other cultures outside of the Aryan race \u2014 not to absolve any groups or make anti-racist arguments. An article published by the United States Holocaust Museum explained that although black people were not targeted in the same way as Jews, they were still persecuted, and Germany produced propaganda that painted black soldiers as chronic rapists and a threat to the \u201cpurity\u201d of the German race:\u00a0 The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups. [\u2026] Following World War I and the\u00a0Treaty of Versailles\u00a0(1919), the victorious Allies occupied the Rhineland in western Germany. The use of French colonial troops, some of whom were black, in these occupation forces exacerbated anti-black racism in Germany. Racist propaganda against black soldiers depicted them as rapists of German women and carriers of venereal and other diseases. The children of black soldiers and German women were called \u201cRhineland Bastards.\u201d The Nazis, at the time a small political movement, viewed them as a threat to the purity of the Germanic race. In\u00a0Mein\u00a0Kampf (My Struggle), Hitler charged that \u201cthe Jews had brought the Negroes into the Rhineland with the clear aim of ruining the hated white race by the necessarily-resulting bastardization.\u201dn\nClaim: A book about Hitler quotes him as saying that he would start a third world war \u2014 after his death.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"False.

Notably, too, the law includes many other restrictions on deadly force, not just what type of crime is being committed.\"","fact_checkers":"Sue Owen","premise":"\"Discussing the divide between states red and blue, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently said that Texans are allowed to shoot people who are causing a nuisance. \"\"If you want to use a gun to kill someone who\u2019s, say, spraypainting a highway underpass at night,\"\" Reich wrote in a June 8, 2013, blog post at robertreich.org, \"\"you might want to go to Texas, where it\u2019s legal to shoot someone who\u2019s committing a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 under the cover of dark.\"\" Reich, who headed the Labor Department under President Bill Clinton, has a law degree and is now a University of California-Berkeley professor of public policy. He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago\u2019s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. \"\"Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft,\"\" he said. \"\"Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return,\"\" he said, later adding, \"\"It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws,\"\" the verdict means \"\"it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance.\"\" In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict. He later switched to saying it is \"\"one way\"\" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert\u2019s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich \"\"is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law.\"\" The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one\u2019s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person \"\"reasonably believes\"\" such force is necessary to prevent imminent \"\"theft during the nighttime\"\" or \"\"criminal mischief during the nighttime.\"\" Jurors concluded that the \"\"theft\"\" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. \"\"She was committing a scam,\"\" he said.

Even if prostitution had been a crucial point, it\u2019s not a \"\"public nuisance\"\" in Texas law. It\u2019s classified under \"\"public indecency\"\" in Penal Code Title 9, Section 43.02. Public nuisances can be much lesser offenses such as creating noise, Texas District and County Attorneys Association spokesman Clay Abbott told us by phone. Reich\u2019s example of the highway spraypainter bridges the gap: \"\"Spraypainting would be both a public nuisance and criminal mischief,\"\" Abbott said. Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person\u2019s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter. Spraypaint can be removed or painted over, so the example falls down right there, Abbott said. \"\"It\u2019s a ridiculous statement.\"\" Dix said, \"\"I stress this is not an example of a rule that in Texas one can \u2018shoot someone who\u2019s committing a \"\"public nuisance\"\" under the cover of dark.\u2019 It is an example of a Texas rule providing broadly (and probably unwisely) that one can use even deadly force to protect property from loss or damage.\"\" Like Dix and Barrera, Abbott told us Reich is wrong to say Texans can use deadly force on someone committing a public nuisance. They also emphasized that the existence of a possible legal defense does not mean the shooter would be acquitted or that shooting criminals is the right thing to do. One final point: We wondered why the law specified \"\"during the nighttime.\"\" Abbott speculated it was a holdover from English common law. Many states once had definitions of burglary with a stipulation about nighttime, which William Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century analysis of English law said makes the crime more serious not so much because daylight is lacking but because \"\"sleep has disarmed the owner, and rendered his castle defenceless.\"\" Our ruling Reich said that in Texas, \"\"it's legal to shoot someone who's committing a \u2018public nuisance\u2019 under the cover of dark,\"\" claiming that a recent acquittal hinged on prostitution, that prostitution was a form of public nuisance, and that therefore it\u2019s legal to shoot people creating a nuisance. Legal experts and a lawyer in the murder trial told us Reich was wrong. The verdict hinged on theft; prostitution is not a \"\"public nuisance\"\" in Texas; and state law doesn\u2019t say deadly force can be used on people creating nuisances.

He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago\u2019s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee. Instead, she left after about 20 minutes, saying she had to give the money to her driver, Gilbert testified. The driver pulled away and Gilbert shot at the car with an assault rifle. Frago was hit and paralyzed, dying six months later when her family took her off artificial respiration. Gilbert's defense team argued that his actions were justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. They said that Frago misled Gilbert when they arranged the transaction, making her refusal to have sex or return his money into theft. Reich disagreed. \"\"Failure to perform a service that is illegal -- kidnapping a baby, bribing a legislator, delivering cocaine, or providing sex for money -- is not a theft,\"\" he said. \"\"Anyone exercising common sense would understand that this was at most a contractual dispute over what he paid for and what she owed him in return,\"\" he said, later adding, \"\"It must be that the jury regarded prostitution as a crime, warranting the use of deadly force. But since prostitution is not a crime warranting the use of deadly force -- it is typically prosecuted under nuisance laws,\"\" the verdict means \"\"it is permissible in Texas to shoot someone who commits a public nuisance.\"\" In his initial emails to us, Reich said this was the only way to interpret the verdict.

'\u201d\u00a0 The law\u00a0referenced was the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as the\u00a0McCarran\u2013Walter Act. Its text is available in full at the U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services (USCIS) web site, where a preface indicates\u00a0that the law has \u201cbeen amended many times over the years but is still the basic body of immigration law.\u201d The claim typically cited \u201cChapter 2 Section 212\u201d of the Act, which excludes as ineligible for admission the following persons: In general\u00a0any alien\u00a0who a consular officer or the Attorney General knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in\u00a0any activity a purpose of which is the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means. That law, originally aimed at Communists, could be used now to exclude persons (both Muslims and non-Muslims) who have demonstrated an affiliation or sympathy with violent extremist groups professing Islamist motivations and goals (e.g., ISIS, al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram) from entering the U.S., but asserting that it enables a de facto ban on all Muslims is inaccurate. Most major religions involve basic, agreed-upon sets of tenets by\u00a0which their faithful live, and no widely-accepted understanding of Islam encompasses a prohibition on\u00a0following the laws of any country or advocates the overthrow of government. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was not without critics, among them President Harry S. Truman, who vetoed the bill on\u00a025 June 1952. In a letter titled \u201cVeto of Bill to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality\u201d and addressed to the House of Representatives, President Truman described\u00a0the bill\u2019s provisions as both antithetical to American values and discriminatory: The greatest vice of the present quota system, however, is that it discriminates, deliberately and intentionally, against many of the peoples of the world \u2026\u00a0The desired effect [of selective admission of immigrants] was obtained\u00a0\u2026\u00a0People from such countries as Greece, or Spain, or Latvia were virtually deprived of any opportunity to come here at all, simply because Greeks or Spaniards or Latvians had not come here before 1920 in any substantial numbers. The idea behind this discriminatory policy was, to put it baldly, that Americans with English or Irish names were better people and better citizens than Americans with Italian or Greek or Polish names. It was thought that people of West European origin made better citizens than Rumanians or Yugoslavs or Ukrainians or Hungarians or Baits or Austrians. Such a concept is utterly unworthy of our traditions and our ideals. It violates the great political doctrine of the Declaration of Independence that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d It denies the humanitarian creed inscribed beneath the Statue of Liberty proclaiming to all nations, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d It repudiates our basic religious concepts, our belief in the brotherhood of man, and in the words of St. Paul that \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free \u2026. for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d In that letter President Truman\u00a0further maintained the act\u2019s provisions were out of alignment with foreign policy goals, inhibiting immigrants who needed it most from seeking safe harbor in America: The basis of this quota system was false and unworthy in 1924. It is even worse now. At the present time, this quota system keeps out the very people we want to bring in. It is incredible to me that, in this year of 1952, we should again be enacting into law such a slur on the patriotism, the capacity, and the decency of a large part of our citizenry. Today, we have entered into an alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty, with Italy, Greece, and Turkey against one of the most terrible threats mankind has ever faced. We are asking them to join with us in protecting the peace of the world. We are helping them to build their defenses, and train their men, in the common cause. But, through this bill we say to their people: You are less worthy to come to this country than Englishmen or Irishmen; you Italians, who need to find homes abroad in the hundreds of thousands \u2014 you shall have a quota of 5,645; you Greeks, struggling to assist the helpless victims of a communist civil war \u2014 you shall have a quota of 308; and you Turks, you are brave defenders of the Eastern flank, but you shall have a quota of only 225! Truman\u2019s words seemed exceptionally prescient when he spoke of citizens in countries that had in recent years fallen behind the Iron Curtain: Today, we are \u201cprotecting\u201d ourselves, as we were in 1924, against being flooded by immigrants from Eastern Europe. This is fantastic. The countries of Eastern Europe have fallen under the communist yoke \u2014 they are silenced, fenced off by barbed wire and minefields \u2014 no one passes their borders but at the risk of his life. We do not need to be protected against immigrants from these countries \u2014 on the contrary we want to stretch out a helping hand, to save those who have managed to flee into Western Europe, to succor those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism, to welcome and restore them against the day when their countries will, as we hope, be free again \u2026\u00a0some 30,000 Rumanians, who have managed to escape the labor camps and the mass deportations of their Soviet masters, have asked our help. These are only a few examples of the absurdity, the cruelty of carrying over into this year of 1952 the isolationist limitations of our 1924 law. In that letter, President Truman spoke specifically of immigration quotas arranged deliberately to exclude specific nationalities. A large portion of the letter directly addressed Truman\u2019s belief that the American way of life ought to be extended to those living under the same totalitarian regimes the U.S. hoped to vanquish. Truman lamented that in \u201cno other realm of our national life are we so hampered and stultified by the dead hand of the past, as we are in this field of immigration.\u201d The\u00a0\u201cISLAM WAS BANNED FROM THE USA IN 1952\u201d claim proved popular\u00a0following a period of increasing rhetoric similar to that which Truman decried as discriminatory and outdated\u00a0in 1952. The basic claim hinged on the tautological assertion that adherence to Islam alone constitutes participation in an \u201corganization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by \u2018force, violence, or other unconstitutional means.

Its text is available in full at the U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services (USCIS) web site, where a preface indicates\u00a0that the law has \u201cbeen amended many times over the years but is still the basic body of immigration law.\u201d The claim typically cited \u201cChapter 2 Section 212\u201d of the Act, which excludes as ineligible for admission the following persons: In general\u00a0any alien\u00a0who a consular officer or the Attorney General knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in\u00a0any activity a purpose of which is the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means. That law, originally aimed at Communists, could be used now to exclude persons (both Muslims and non-Muslims) who have demonstrated an affiliation or sympathy with violent extremist groups professing Islamist motivations and goals (e.g., ISIS, al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram) from entering the U.S., but asserting that it enables a de facto ban on all Muslims is inaccurate. Most major religions involve basic, agreed-upon sets of tenets by\u00a0which their faithful live, and no widely-accepted understanding of Islam encompasses a prohibition on\u00a0following the laws of any country or advocates the overthrow of government. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was not without critics, among them President Harry S. Truman, who vetoed the bill on\u00a025 June 1952. In a letter titled \u201cVeto of Bill to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality\u201d and addressed to the House of Representatives, President Truman described\u00a0the bill\u2019s provisions as both antithetical to American values and discriminatory: The greatest vice of the present quota system, however, is that it discriminates, deliberately and intentionally, against many of the peoples of the world \u2026\u00a0The desired effect [of selective admission of immigrants] was obtained\u00a0\u2026\u00a0People from such countries as Greece, or Spain, or Latvia were virtually deprived of any opportunity to come here at all, simply because Greeks or Spaniards or Latvians had not come here before 1920 in any substantial numbers. The idea behind this discriminatory policy was, to put it baldly, that Americans with English or Irish names were better people and better citizens than Americans with Italian or Greek or Polish names. It was thought that people of West European origin made better citizens than Rumanians or Yugoslavs or Ukrainians or Hungarians or Baits or Austrians. Such a concept is utterly unworthy of our traditions and our ideals. It violates the great political doctrine of the Declaration of Independence that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d It denies the humanitarian creed inscribed beneath the Statue of Liberty proclaiming to all nations, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d It repudiates our basic religious concepts, our belief in the brotherhood of man, and in the words of St. Paul that \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free \u2026. for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d In that letter President Truman\u00a0further maintained the act\u2019s provisions were out of alignment with foreign policy goals, inhibiting immigrants who needed it most from seeking safe harbor in America: The basis of this quota system was false and unworthy in 1924. It is even worse now. At the present time, this quota system keeps out the very people we want to bring in. It is incredible to me that, in this year of 1952, we should again be enacting into law such a slur on the patriotism, the capacity, and the decency of a large part of our citizenry. Today, we have entered into an alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty, with Italy, Greece, and Turkey against one of the most terrible threats mankind has ever faced. We are asking them to join with us in protecting the peace of the world. We are helping them to build their defenses, and train their men, in the common cause. But, through this bill we say to their people: You are less worthy to come to this country than Englishmen or Irishmen; you Italians, who need to find homes abroad in the hundreds of thousands \u2014 you shall have a quota of 5,645; you Greeks, struggling to assist the helpless victims of a communist civil war \u2014 you shall have a quota of 308; and you Turks, you are brave defenders of the Eastern flank, but you shall have a quota of only 225! Truman\u2019s words seemed exceptionally prescient when he spoke of citizens in countries that had in recent years fallen behind the Iron Curtain: Today, we are \u201cprotecting\u201d ourselves, as we were in 1924, against being flooded by immigrants from Eastern Europe. This is fantastic. The countries of Eastern Europe have fallen under the communist yoke \u2014 they are silenced, fenced off by barbed wire and minefields \u2014 no one passes their borders but at the risk of his life. We do not need to be protected against immigrants from these countries \u2014 on the contrary we want to stretch out a helping hand, to save those who have managed to flee into Western Europe, to succor those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism, to welcome and restore them against the day when their countries will, as we hope, be free again \u2026\u00a0some 30,000 Rumanians, who have managed to escape the labor camps and the mass deportations of their Soviet masters, have asked our help. These are only a few examples of the absurdity, the cruelty of carrying over into this year of 1952 the isolationist limitations of our 1924 law. In that letter, President Truman spoke specifically of immigration quotas arranged deliberately to exclude specific nationalities. A large portion of the letter directly addressed Truman\u2019s belief that the American way of life ought to be extended to those living under the same totalitarian regimes the U.S. hoped to vanquish. Truman lamented that in \u201cno other realm of our national life are we so hampered and stultified by the dead hand of the past, as we are in this field of immigration.\u201d The\u00a0\u201cISLAM WAS BANNED FROM THE USA IN 1952\u201d claim proved popular\u00a0following a period of increasing rhetoric similar to that which Truman decried as discriminatory and outdated\u00a0in 1952. The basic claim hinged on the tautological assertion that adherence to Islam alone constitutes participation in an \u201corganization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by \u2018force, violence, or other unconstitutional means. '\u201dn\nClaim: Muslims were banned from immigrating to the United States in 1952 under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim is false. While the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 did include provisions for barring aliens who sought to overthrow the U.S. government by force, violence, or unconstitutional means, this does not equate to a blanket ban on Muslims. The act was not specifically targeting Muslims, but rather individuals or groups who posed a threat to the government. The law can be used to exclude individuals based on their affiliations with extremist groups, not based solely on their religious beliefs. Therefore, the claim that Muslims were banned from immigrating to the U.S. in 1952 is false."}

{"claim_id":23310,"hypothesis":"Alan Grayson Says Daniel Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives.","date_published":"September 28, 2010","explanation_1":"Alan Grayson says opponent wants to make divorce illegal in stinging new ad","fact_checkers":"Aaron Sharockman","premise":"\"U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as \"\"die quickly\"\" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots -- is making another series of eye-catching claims. Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster.\"\" The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript:  Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) \"\"Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.\"\" Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) \"\"Wives submit yourself to your own husband.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us.\"\" Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL. Webster: \"\"You should submit to me. That's in the Bible.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers.\"\" Webster: \"\"Submit to me.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"He wants to force raped women to bear the child.\"\" Webster: \"\"Submit to me.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws.\"\" The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that \"\"Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands\"\" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: \"\"SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990).\"\" So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, \"\"creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.\"\" Florida law currently allows married couples to\u00a0divorce if a court finds that the marriage is \"\"irretrievably broken.\"\" It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary \"\"covenant marriage.\"\" Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:  \"\"I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.\"\" The covenant marriage agreement \"\"may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery,\"\" according to the bill Webster filed. \"\"A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted,\"\" HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that \"\"no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife,\"\" but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the \"\"original\"\" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was \"\"significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,\"\" Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad \"\"Taliban Dan Webster,\"\" Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce.

Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as \"\"die quickly\"\" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots -- is making another series of eye-catching claims. Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster.\"\" The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript:  Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) \"\"Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.\"\" Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) \"\"Wives submit yourself to your own husband.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us.\"\" Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL. Webster: \"\"You should submit to me. That's in the Bible.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers.\"\" Webster: \"\"Submit to me.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"He wants to force raped women to bear the child.\"\" Webster: \"\"Submit to me.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws.\"\" The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that \"\"Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands\"\" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: \"\"SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990).\"\" So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, \"\"creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.\"\" Florida law currently allows married couples to\u00a0divorce if a court finds that the marriage is \"\"irretrievably broken.\"\" It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary \"\"covenant marriage.\"\" Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:  \"\"I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.\"\" The covenant marriage agreement \"\"may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery,\"\" according to the bill Webster filed. \"\"A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted,\"\" HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that \"\"no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife,\"\" but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the \"\"original\"\" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was \"\"significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,\"\" Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages.

It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process \"\"disrupts ocean chemistry,\"\" he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, \"\"but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years.\"\" That's important, he said, because, \"\"This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now.\"\" On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently \"\"much more acidic\"\" than it has been for \"\"many millions of years?\"\" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse\u2019s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: \"\"Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years.\"\" That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back \"\"many millions of years\"\" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that \"\"the uncertainty in the data points is very large.\"\" She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. \"\"If you go back 4 million years, you're there,\"\" Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. \"\"The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now.\"\" Again, that's not \"\"many millions of years.\"\" Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, \"\"Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today,\"\" he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off.

One expert estimates campaigns could dole out nearly a half billion dollars to influence the fate of the dozen or more initiatives expected on the November ballot. Eight have already qualified. They include a measure to overturn the state\u2019s ban on single-use plastic bags; one to raise funds for school facilities; and another that would regulate the cost the state pays for prescription drugs. Campaigns for a dozen additional initiatives, including a proposed tobacco tax hike, are gathering signatures and could qualify their measures later this year. As money pours in for and against these initiatives, a claim by Californians for Lower Drug Prices caught our attention. The campaign is backing a measure on the November ballot that would impose price controls on state prescription drug purchases. Supporters call the initiative the California Drug Price Relief Act. And they say spending by the measure\u2019s opponent has dwarfed all other fundraising. \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the prescription drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined,\"\" Californians for Lower Drug Prices said in a March 21 press release. That campaign is funded by the Los Angeles-based nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers health services and is often at odds with the pharmaceutical industry. We wondered was its claim about Big Pharma true? Had a group of pharmaceutical companies really outspent all other ballot campaigns, combined? How much did all that spending add up to? We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It\u2019s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it\u2019s contributions came from 27 \"\"out-of-state pharmaceutical companies,\"\" as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer\u2019s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state\u2019s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America\u2019s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from\u00a01998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio \/ file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It\u2019s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it\u2019s not necessarily more that what\u2019s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It\u2019s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year\u2019s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what\u2019s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what\u2019s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle. What\u2019s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November\u2019s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. \"\"The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate,\"\" he said. \"\"When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings \u2026 you realize far more money has been raised.\"\" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year\u2019s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and \"\"missed\"\" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending \"\"is an early snapshot,\"\" noting it\u2019s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim \"\"ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October.\"\" Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot.

One expert estimates campaigns could dole out nearly a half billion dollars to influence the fate of the dozen or more initiatives expected on the November ballot. Eight have already qualified. They include a measure to overturn the state\u2019s ban on single-use plastic bags; one to raise funds for school facilities; and another that would regulate the cost the state pays for prescription drugs. Campaigns for a dozen additional initiatives, including a proposed tobacco tax hike, are gathering signatures and could qualify their measures later this year. As money pours in for and against these initiatives, a claim by Californians for Lower Drug Prices caught our attention. The campaign is backing a measure on the November ballot that would impose price controls on state prescription drug purchases. Supporters call the initiative the California Drug Price Relief Act. And they say spending by the measure\u2019s opponent has dwarfed all other fundraising. \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the prescription drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined,\"\" Californians for Lower Drug Prices said in a March 21 press release. That campaign is funded by the Los Angeles-based nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers health services and is often at odds with the pharmaceutical industry. We wondered was its claim about Big Pharma true? Had a group of pharmaceutical companies really outspent all other ballot campaigns, combined? How much did all that spending add up to? We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It\u2019s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it\u2019s contributions came from 27 \"\"out-of-state pharmaceutical companies,\"\" as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer\u2019s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state\u2019s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America\u2019s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from\u00a01998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio \/ file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It\u2019s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it\u2019s not necessarily more that what\u2019s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It\u2019s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year\u2019s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what\u2019s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what\u2019s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle. What\u2019s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November\u2019s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. \"\"The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate,\"\" he said. \"\"When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings \u2026 you realize far more money has been raised.\"\" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year\u2019s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and \"\"missed\"\" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending \"\"is an early snapshot,\"\" noting it\u2019s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim \"\"ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October.\"\" Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot. In late March, it claimed: \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined.\"\" From our research, it\u2019s clear that 27 of the 30 companies backing Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure are, indeed, from outside California.

So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks.\u201d","date_published":"April 29, 2020","explanation_1":"The FDA granted emergency authorization to new technology that can sterilize respirator masks up to 20 times. Experts uniformly agree that sterilized respirator masks aren\u2019t as protective as new ones \u2014 and that this is an emergency measure, not a solution for shortfalls of personal protective equipment. In many cases, normal wear and tear means N95 respirators cannot be sanitized and reused without putting health workers at risk.","fact_checkers":"Shefali Luthra","premise":"\"As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, front-line health care workers are decrying unsafe working conditions \u2014 in particular, describing inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or PPE. Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available. But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. \"\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"\"may be effective\"\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"\"when there are insufficient supplies.\"\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"\"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\" The reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"\"Decontamination is a complicated process,\"\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"\"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,\"\" she said. N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration. Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle\u2019s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit. \"\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\"\" Kenney said. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\"\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s.

Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available. But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. \"\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"\"may be effective\"\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"\"when there are insufficient supplies.\"\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"\"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\" The reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"\"Decontamination is a complicated process,\"\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"\"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,\"\" she said. N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration. Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle\u2019s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit. \"\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\"\" Kenney said. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\"\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. In describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators, Trump said the United States is using \"\"some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask.\"\" That, he argued, \"\"is like ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" It is true that technology exists to sterilize N95s up to 20 times.

{"claim_id":9245,"hypothesis":"Even partial steroid treatment can benefit extremely preterm infants, NIH study suggests","date_published":"October 18, 2016","explanation_1":"This news release by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) covers research findings on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment in pregnant women expecting preterm delivery, as published in JAMA Pediatrics. Although women likely to deliver before 34 weeks are routinely given steroid treatment to reduce the chance of complications, physicians weren\u2019t sure whether a partial course of treatment would provide the same \u2014 or any \u2014 benefits. In this new study, researchers concluded that ANS therapy was dose-dependent in providing protective effects against death or neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm infants. The release claims that even partial steroid treatment can\u00a0 benefit those born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. Details on funding sources and treatment\u2019s context are given high up in the news release. It also starts out well by providing some relevant figures, such as the number of subjects in the study, their gestational ages and follow-up times. However, other important quantitative data aren\u2019t disclosed at all, such as the extent of the treatment\u2019s benefits in the three groups, as well as the costs associated with steroid therapy. Instead, only sweeping, vague comparative language is used to illustrate complications and other outcomes, which leaves the reader wondering how beneficial steroid treatment really is. Another major point that was not mentioned was the study\u2019s limitations \u2014 namely that this was an observational cohort study that cannot establish cause and effect. Patients were not blinded to their treatments and were not randomized, which led to an unequal distribution of patients in the 3 groups in terms of socioeconomic status and other infant variables. In the end, the complete ANS treatment group already had distinct advantages from these factors in achieving better outcomes. Although studies on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment already exist in the body of literature, there hasn\u2019t been much research looking at dose-dependent effects of ANS on extremely premature infants, especially in regard to early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other studies have looked into partial ANS courses and rates of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease among infants. Steroids are routinely given to pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks and are considered to be standard treatment. However, there is no clear protocol on administering ANS treatment when premature delivery is approaching, since completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours. If the latest research shows that even partial ANS treatment provides benefits to preterm infants, this should be reported to empower patients and to guide clinical practice.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"The two antenatal steroids (ANS) used in this study included betamethasone and dexamethasone, but their costs were never mentioned.

According to drugs.com, 500 mL of dexamethasone costs $23.94. Our online search didn\u2019t uncover any price estimates for liquid Betamethasone. Drugs.com only lists topical Betamethasone prices.

According to these legal contracts, you still own your DNA, but so does Ancestry.com. The family history website Ancestry.com is selling a new DNA testing service called AncestryDNA. But the DNA and genetic data that Ancestry.com collects may be used against \u201cyou or a genetic relative.\u201d According to its privacy policies, Ancestry.com takes ownership of your DNA forever. Your ownership of your DNA, on the other hand, is limited in years. The article has caused widespread\u00a0concern\u00a0and prompted a public response from Ancestry.com\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer Eric Heath, who called Winston\u2019s post \u201cinflammatory and inaccurate\u201d. In response to our questions, Heath emphasized that Ancestry.com does not take ownership of your DNA; rather, you license it to them: \u2026The consumer maintains ownership of their data. This is actually why we need a license in order to conduct our analysis, display their results, and so on. Not only do they own their own data, but we allow them to download their raw data and they can ask us to destroy the data any time. Several documents control customers\u2019 agreements with Ancestry.com: the terms and conditions, an informed consent agreement, and the privacy policy. Before signing up for the DNA test, Heath says, you can also opt out of allowing your DNA data to be used for research, whether academic or commercial, when signing the informed consent agreement: Aside from the right to use their data to provide our services, we always ask for separate approval to use data in any other way. For example, when you activate a kit, there is a screen that pops up as part of our Informed Consent process that asks if you want to take part in anonymous third party research projects. You can say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and your choice has no impact on the basic services we provide. Heath added that you can revoke any license you give Ancestry.com to use and distribute your DNA by deleting the data or closing your Ancestry.com account: We also allow consumers to change their Informed Consent decisions at any time. So, you could agree to take part in third party research when you first sign up, but then later decide you don\u2019t want to and we\u2019ll respect your change of mind. Obviously, if research has been conducted that included your anonymized data, we can\u2019t delete it after the fact. However, Winston objects to this distinction: A license is a contractual form of ownership. At its most basic, a license is defined as \u201ca permit from an authority to own or use something.\u201d Ancestry.com does not have \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d because customers still retain ownership of their own DNA. Ancestry.com does not have \u201cabsolute ownership\u201d because customers can revoke the license. But, Ancestry.com irrefutably takes ownership of customers\u2019 genetic data by contractual license granted in the Terms and Conditions. Omri Ben-Shahar, a University of Chicago law professor and an expert in contracts and consumer protection pointed to the same opt-outs that Heath did, saying:  A lot of the things [Winston] says happen don\u2019t have to happen \u2014\u00a0you have a choice over them. Even if a customer left every opt-out unclicked, and gave Ancestry.com full permission to do anything they were legally entitled to do with your data, Ben-Shahar says that it still be licensed, not owned, and you can still legally\u00a0retract it at any time. In his blog post, Winston also pointed out that customers can revoke their consent at any time. However, he directed us towards a section of the AncestryDNA\u00a0informed consent\u00a0agreement that addresses the potential risks of signing up for the DNA test: There is a potential risk that data about you could become public as the result of a security breach\u2026There is a potential risk that third parties could identify you from research that is made publicly available, for example if published in a scientific journal\u2026When DNA samples are physically transferred from us to collaborators, there is a potential risk that the samples could be lost or taken while in transit or storage. We take precautions to reduce the likelihood that this will happen and DNA samples are not transferred with your name or contact information. As Ancestry.com explains in the informed consent agreement, the fact that they remove identifying information from your DNA data before they add it to their database does not remove\u00a0this risk: Although we remove common identifying information (such as your name and contact information) from any data before publication, genetic data is different from other data because it can be used as an identifier in combination with other information. It is not currently common to do this but it can be done, particularly if genetic data about you or genetic relatives is available from other public genetic databases. Jeff Sovern, a law professor at St John\u2019s University in New York City\u00a0and an expert in consumer law, told us the circumstances under\u00a0which Ancestry.com might share your DNA data with others could be wider than they first appear. One significant section of the Terms and Conditions read as follows (until it was changed in light of the May 2017 controversy):\u00a0 By submitting DNA to AncestryDNA, you grant AncestryDNA and the Ancestry Group Companies a perpetual, royalty-free, world-wide, transferable license to use your DNA, and any DNA you submit for any person from whom you obtained legal authorization as described in this Agreement, and to use, host, sublicense and distribute the resulting analysis to the extent and in the form or context we deem appropriate on or through any media or medium and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered. The company no longer describes the license as \u201cperpetual\u201d, and the phrase \u201cto the extent and in the form or context we deem appropriate\u201d has been removed: By submitting DNA to AncestryDNA, you grant AncestryDNA and the Ancestry Group Companies a royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable license to host, transfer, process, analyze, distribute, and communicate your Genetic Information for the purposes of providing you products and services, conducting Ancestry\u2019s research and product development, enhancing Ancestry\u2019s user experience, and making and offering personalized products and services. In other words: we use your Genetic Information to provide products and services to you and improve our products and services for all our users. In addition, you understand that by providing any DNA to us, you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products that may be developed by AncestryDNA using your Genetic Information. Jeff Sovern said that the privacy statement\u2019s use of examples, rather than an exhaustive\u00a0list of scenarios in which user\u2019s information can be shared, makes him \u201cnervous\u201d:  That means the list is not complete, and there could be circumstances in which Ancestry could disclose the data that are not included in the list. Here\u2019s an analogy: if someone says \u201cexamples of things I do when I go out are to see a movie or a show,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean the person doesn\u2019t also go out to get drunk. Signing up for Ancestry.com\u2019s DNA test does not mean that the company owns your DNA data, in the complete and permanent way in which that word is typically understood. Customers license it to the company. Customers can choose not to allow their genetic information to be used for certain purposes, and can also revoke the license and have the DNA data and sample destroyed\u00a0if they wish \u2014 something that would not be possible if Ancestry.com owned them outright. However, granting Ancestry.com that license can involve giving them relatively significant rights over DNA data, and the scope of these rights may go beyond what is immediately apparent. Furthermore, licensing your DNA data to Ancestry.com does come with risks to your privacy, as well as potentially resulting in problems obtaining life insurance or, in certain circumstances, even getting hired for a particular job.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Legal Affairs, ancestry.com, dna, dna testing","__index_level_0__":994,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn 17 May 2017, Joel Winston, a consumer protection attorney and former deputy attorney general of New Jersey, published a blog\u00a0post\u00a0with the claim that the genealogy website Ancestry.com was \u201ctaking DNA ownership rights\u201d from customers and their families:\u00a0 Don\u2019t use the AncestryDNA testing service without actually reading the Ancestry.com Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. According to these legal contracts, you still own your DNA, but so does Ancestry.com. The family history website Ancestry.com is selling a new DNA testing service called AncestryDNA. But the DNA and genetic data that Ancestry.com collects may be used against \u201cyou or a genetic relative.\u201d According to its privacy policies, Ancestry.com takes ownership of your DNA forever. Your ownership of your DNA, on the other hand, is limited in years. The article has caused widespread\u00a0concern\u00a0and prompted a public response from Ancestry.com\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer Eric Heath, who called Winston\u2019s post \u201cinflammatory and inaccurate\u201d. In response to our questions, Heath emphasized that Ancestry.com does not take ownership of your DNA; rather, you license it to them: \u2026The consumer maintains ownership of their data. This is actually why we need a license in order to conduct our analysis, display their results, and so on. Not only do they own their own data, but we allow them to download their raw data and they can ask us to destroy the data any time. Several documents control customers\u2019 agreements with Ancestry.com: the terms and conditions, an informed consent agreement, and the privacy policy. Before signing up for the DNA test, Heath says, you can also opt out of allowing your DNA data to be used for research, whether academic or commercial, when signing the informed consent agreement: Aside from the right to use their data to provide our services, we always ask for separate approval to use data in any other way. For example, when you activate a kit, there is a screen that pops up as part of our Informed Consent process that asks if you want to take part in anonymous third party research projects. You can say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and your choice has no impact on the basic services we provide. Heath added that you can revoke any license you give Ancestry.com to use and distribute your DNA by deleting the data or closing your Ancestry.com account: We also allow consumers to change their Informed Consent decisions at any time. So, you could agree to take part in third party research when you first sign up, but then later decide you don\u2019t want to and we\u2019ll respect your change of mind. Obviously, if research has been conducted that included your anonymized data, we can\u2019t delete it after the fact. However, Winston objects to this distinction: A license is a contractual form of ownership. At its most basic, a license is defined as \u201ca permit from an authority to own or use something.\u201d Ancestry.com does not have \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d because customers still retain ownership of their own DNA. Ancestry.com does not have \u201cabsolute ownership\u201d because customers can revoke the license. But, Ancestry.com irrefutably takes ownership of customers\u2019 genetic data by contractual license granted in the Terms and Conditions. Omri Ben-Shahar, a University of Chicago law professor and an expert in contracts and consumer protection pointed to the same opt-outs that Heath did, saying:  A lot of the things [Winston] says happen don\u2019t have to happen \u2014\u00a0you have a choice over them. Even if a customer left every opt-out unclicked, and gave Ancestry.com full permission to do anything they were legally entitled to do with your data, Ben-Shahar says that it still be licensed, not owned, and you can still legally\u00a0retract it at any time. In his blog post, Winston also pointed out that customers can revoke their consent at any time. However, he directed us towards a section of the AncestryDNA\u00a0informed consent\u00a0agreement that addresses the potential risks of signing up for the DNA test: There is a potential risk that data about you could become public as the result of a security breach\u2026There is a potential risk that third parties could identify you from research that is made publicly available, for example if published in a scientific journal\u2026When DNA samples are physically transferred from us to collaborators, there is a potential risk that the samples could be lost or taken while in transit or storage. We take precautions to reduce the likelihood that this will happen and DNA samples are not transferred with your name or contact information. As Ancestry.com explains in the informed consent agreement, the fact that they remove identifying information from your DNA data before they add it to their database does not remove\u00a0this risk: Although we remove common identifying information (such as your name and contact information) from any data before publication, genetic data is different from other data because it can be used as an identifier in combination with other information. It is not currently common to do this but it can be done, particularly if genetic data about you or genetic relatives is available from other public genetic databases. Jeff Sovern, a law professor at St John\u2019s University in New York City\u00a0and an expert in consumer law, told us the circumstances under\u00a0which Ancestry.com might share your DNA data with others could be wider than they first appear.

(#ENDtheDRUGWAR) Corrections Corporation of America, the largest for-profit prison company in America, spends nearly $1 million a year against cannabis legalization. This is their official reason why: \u201cchanges with respect to drugs and controlled substances \u2026 could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for the correctional facilities to house them. The clear message was that laws prohibiting the possession and use of marijuana (and other drugs) are less about curbing the dangers such drug use might pose to the public than they are about a privatized incarceration system that has a strong incentive to ensure prison populations remain high enough to maintain profit levels. Missing from the widely circulated graphic were any sources, citations, date, or context for the purported statement from the CCA about changes to drug laws. The image meme\u2019s overall viewpoint, however, was elucidated in an April 2015\u00a0Washington Post item critical of privatized prisons in general and CCA in particular: Several industries have become notorious for the millions\u00a0they spend on influencing legislation and getting friendly candidates into office \u2026 one has managed to quickly build\u00a0influence with comparatively little scrutiny: Private prisons. The two largest for-profit\u00a0prison companies\u00a0in the United States \u2014 GEO and\u00a0Corrections Corporation of America\u00a0\u2014 and their associates have funneled more than $10 million to candidates since 1989 and have spent nearly $25 million on lobbying efforts. Meanwhile, these private companies have seen their revenue and market share soar. They now rake in a combined $3.3 billion in annual revenue and the private federal prison population more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, according to a report by the Justice Policy Institute. Private companies house nearly half of the nation\u2019s immigrant detainees, compared to about 25 percent a decade ago, a Huffington Post report found. In total, there are now about 130 private prisons in the country with about 157,000 beds. A portion of that item included the source which was presumably the one paraphrased in the meme, attributed to a 2014 CCA annual report: The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them \u2026 Legislation has been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. A January 2013 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) piece provided both the quote and a link to its source CCA\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K filings, dated 25 February 2011. However, it\u2019s important to note the purpose of those mandatory 10-K filings, which include a \u201ccomprehensive overview of the company\u2019s business and financial condition.\u201d As SEC Chair Mary Jo White noted in 2013, a key aspect of those reports is disclosure of risk to shareholders and potential investors: Without proper disclosure, investors would be unable to make informed decisions. They would not know about the financial condition of the company they are investing in. Nor would they know about how the company operates, who its board members are or what business, operational or financial risks the company faces, let alone may face in the future. The core purpose of disclosure, of course, is to provide investors with the information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions. Such information makes it possible for investors to evaluate companies and have the confidence to invest and, as a result, allow our capital markets to flourish. In CCA\u2019s February 2011 Form 10-K filing, therefore, the company was not strategizing about how to prevent changes to existing laws that might adversely affect their profits, but rather listing a number of potential risks to profitability outside the company\u2019s control that shareholders and investors should be aware of: Our ability to secure new contracts to develop and manage correctional and detention facilities depends on many factors outside our control. Our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage new correctional and detention facilities. This possible growth depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions and acceptance of privatization. The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them. Legislation has been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. Also, sentencing alternatives under consideration could put some offenders on probation with electronic monitoring who would otherwise be incarcerated. Similarly, reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities. More recent SEC filings from CCA, such as a document for the year ending 31 December 2015, reflect similar stated risks to investors. That filing also included a statement from CCA that, as a matter of policy, the company does not \u201clobby for or against policies or legislation that would determine the basis for, or duration of, an individual\u2019s incarceration or detention\u201d: This possible growth depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions, governmental budgetary constraints, and governmental and public acceptance of privatization. The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them. Immigration reform laws are currently a focus for legislators and politicians at the federal, state, and local level. Legislation has also been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. Also, sentencing alternatives under consideration could put some offenders on probation with electronic monitoring who would otherwise be incarcerated. Similarly, reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities. Our company does not, under longstanding policy, lobby for or against policies or legislation that would determine the basis for, or duration of, an individual\u2019s incarceration or detention. Nonetheless, the image meme also alleges that the company spends approximately a million dollars per year fighting cannabis legalization. The Center for Responsive Politics\u2018 \u00a0Open Secrets site (a watchdog organization that tracks lobbying efforts) maintains a profile for CCA that places its total expenditures on all lobbying efforts in 2015 at exactly $1,000,000 (and $1,020,000 in 2014). However, the opacity surrounding lobbying makes it difficult to determine precisely how much (if anything) CCA might spend for the purpose of influencing marijuana laws. According to the ACLU 2013 piece referenced above, the company\u2019s lobbying efforts were spread across numerous political interests: Although CCA insists that it does not engage in \u201clobbying or advocacy efforts that would influence enforcement efforts, parole standards, criminal laws, and sentencing policies,\u201d the company spends heavily on both campaign contributions and lobbying. In 2011, CCA gave $710,300 in political contributions to candidates for federal or state office, political parties, and 527 groups (PACs and super-PACs). That same year, CCA spent $1.07 million lobbying federal officials and an undisclosed amount lobbying state officials. Additionally, as NPR reported two years ago, CCA was for many years involved in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), an organization of state legislators and corporations that drafted the basis for Arizona\u2019s anti-immigrant SB1070 and that has consistently advocated for harsh sentencing and detention laws. The breakdown of the $1,020,000 spent on lobbying by CCA in 2014 as presented on Open Secrets wasn\u2019t broken down in detail. CCA\u2019s top lobbying expenditures were listed as \u201cHomeland Security\u201d and \u201cGovernment Issues,\u201d with \u201cLaw Enforcement & Crime\u201d at number three. Apparently the meme cited the total amount of money CCA spends on lobbying and inaccurately framed all of those expenditures as targeting \u201ccannabis legalization.\u201d H.R.4903 (a bill appropriating funds for immigration security in 2013-2014) was listed on Open Secrets as a top interest for which CCA lobbied, which dovetails with CCA disclosures mentioning the jailing of undocumented immigrants. Open Secrets simply listed CCA among agencies possessing an interest in the continued criminalization of marijuana, without providing any details about monies those agencies might expend along those lines: Private prisons are in the business of filling beds, and they make millions by incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders along with violent offenders and white-collar criminals. One private prison company, the GEO Group, Inc., is particularly successful at this: In its 2014 annual report, GEO noted that it had, on average, a facility occupancy rate of 95.7 percent. One of the largest for-profit prison companies, Corrections Corporation of America, stated in a 2010 regulatory filing that laxer drug laws could shrink its bottom line: \u201c[A]ny changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.\u201d Since 2008, the Corrections Corporation of America has spent at least $970,000 a year on lobbying. However, in its federal lobbying reports, the corporation includes a disclaimer that it does not lobby for or against policies that would determine whether an individual is incarcerated. ProPublica found much the same in an\u00a0investigation pertaining partly to\u00a0CCA: while that entity reported CCA spent $17.4 million in a ten-year period on general lobbying, they included no marijuana-specific findings. In short, the quotation about marijuana laws attributed by the original meme to CCA is accurate, but its source and context was an SEC-required disclosure of risks to shareholders, not a company memo advocating opposition to the legalization of marijuana.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Politics Legal, cannabis, marijuana","__index_level_0__":882,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nAn image meme that spread via social media in March 2016 held that Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), a company that owns and manages private prisons and detention centers, spends $1 million a year in lobbying efforts to oppose the legalization of marijuana because fewer people being sent to jail on drug charges would negatively affect their bottom line: DID YOU KNOW?

Apparently the meme cited the total amount of money CCA spends on lobbying and inaccurately framed all of those expenditures as targeting \u201ccannabis legalization.\u201d H.R.4903 (a bill appropriating funds for immigration security in 2013-2014) was listed on Open Secrets as a top interest for which CCA lobbied, which dovetails with CCA disclosures mentioning the jailing of undocumented immigrants. Open Secrets simply listed CCA among agencies possessing an interest in the continued criminalization of marijuana, without providing any details about monies those agencies might expend along those lines: Private prisons are in the business of filling beds, and they make millions by incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders along with violent offenders and white-collar criminals. One private prison company, the GEO Group, Inc., is particularly successful at this: In its 2014 annual report, GEO noted that it had, on average, a facility occupancy rate of 95.7 percent. One of the largest for-profit prison companies, Corrections Corporation of America, stated in a 2010 regulatory filing that laxer drug laws could shrink its bottom line: \u201c[A]ny changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.\u201d Since 2008, the Corrections Corporation of America has spent at least $970,000 a year on lobbying. However, in its federal lobbying reports, the corporation includes a disclaimer that it does not lobby for or against policies that would determine whether an individual is incarcerated. ProPublica found much the same in an\u00a0investigation pertaining partly to\u00a0CCA: while that entity reported CCA spent $17.4 million in a ten-year period on general lobbying, they included no marijuana-specific findings. In short, the quotation about marijuana laws attributed by the original meme to CCA is accurate, but its source and context was an SEC-required disclosure of risks to shareholders, not a company memo advocating opposition to the legalization of marijuana.n\nClaim: The Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) said that cannabis legalization would harm their profits, and they spend $1 million per year fighting changes to marijuana laws.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Partially true and false. While it is true that the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) did mention in their SEC filings that changes to drug laws could potentially affect their profits, they did not specifically mention cannabis legalization. Additionally, while the CCA does spend money on lobbying efforts, it is unclear how much of that specifically targets cannabis legalization. The claim is partially true in the sense that the CCA does acknowledge the potential impact of drug law changes on their profits, but it is false in that there is no direct evidence linking their lobbying efforts to fighting changes to marijuana laws."}

The study followed 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease for 12 weeks after treating them with either apomorphine or placebo. The study measured the participants\u2019 \u201coff\u201d times, which refer to periods when a medication isn\u2019t working well, causing symptoms to worsen. Although the news release provides in-depth historical context and information on the availability of the drug, we wish it could have more critically evaluated the evidence, as well as provided more numbers to illustrate the benefit claims. A discussion on the limitations of evidence, namely how this study may have been through limited peer review, would have been useful. The news release does disclose the funding source \u2014 Britannia Pharmaceuticals, the maker of apomorphine \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t mention that the first author has received speaking and consulting fees from Britannia for at least 8 years. Parkinson\u2019s disease is a progressive disorder affecting the nervous system caused by the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. It affects more than 4 million people worldwide, according to the US National Library of Medicine. About 60,000 new cases are identified each year in the United States. Although there is no cure, many of its symptoms (including tremor, slowed movement, rigidity and problems with balance) can be managed with drug therapies, the main one being levodopa. After long-term use, however, the benefits of levodopa may wear off more quickly after each dose, prolonging \u201coff\u201d times in Parkinson\u2019s patients. If there is another medication that is safe and shortens \u201coff\u201d times, it may provide help to patients who develop resistance to a certain drug, especially with long-term use.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"According to GoodRx.com, 20 cartridges or 3 mL of apomorphine cost between $20,000 to $21,800 depending on the pharmacy. The exact dosage isn\u2019t disclosed, but we know that the infusion was administered via a small portable pump for 14 to 18 hours each day for 12 weeks. Since costs are not discussed in this news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release says that on average, volunteers assigned to apomorphine had 2.5 hours less \u201coff\u201d time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in \u201coff\u201d time during the first week of the trial. Participant-reported scores on how well they thought the treatment worked were also provided: \u201cParticipants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo.\u201d While improvement is given in percentages (and we like to see absolute numbers as well) this does illustrate an absolute rate of improvement. Apomorphine is associated with a slew of side effects \u2013 the more common ones being chest pain, chills, cold sweats, confusion, falling asleep during activity, dizziness, mood changes, swelling and twitching. Less common include fainting, low blood pressure, sweating and vomiting. Rare adverse events are irregular heartbeat and recurrent fainting. In the study, apomorphine was generally well tolerated, and no serious side effects were observed, the news release states. No other safety information is given. One 2009 study looked at the safety of apomorphine when treating \u201coff\u201d episodes in subjects with advanced Parkinson disease. Out of the 546 subjects in the study population, 187 participants discontinued treatment because of side effects, which included nausea and vomiting, dizziness, somnolence, hallucination, yawning, and injection site bruising. The authors concluded, \u201cLong-term use of intermittent apomorphine dosing for treatment of \u2018off\u2019 episodes was generally associated with mild-to-moderate adverse effects.\u201d Another recent 10-year observational study concluded, \u201cMany patients cannot be maintained on AI in the longer term\u201d due to adverse effects and inadequate motor benefit. We wish the news release talked more in depth about the drug\u2019s potential harms, which is why we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release does a good job outlining the study design. This was a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter phase III study, in which researchers followed 107 people with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease for 12 weeks.

Since this study was presented at a medical conference, it may only include preliminary findings and probably also went through a limited peer review process. Peer review is important in establishing the quality and integrity of the science before publication in a journal. Since limitations of the evidence are not discussed, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no disease mongering in this news release. It provides context about the history of the drug. A statement on the incidence of Parkinson\u2019s disease would also have been helpful in understanding the scope of the problem. The funding source of this study was Britannia Pharmaceuticals, a UK-based pharmaceutical company specializing in the neurology market, according to its website. However, the release doesn\u2019t mention that the first author of the study had received research grants from numerous pharmaceutical companies, including Britannia and that the principal investigator is also a consultant for Britannia and serves on its advisory board. We rate this for not disclosing a long-term financial relationship between the author and the drug sponsor. The release gets a Satisfactory for noting that the oral drug levodopa is the gold standard treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease. The release would have been better had it also addressed some comparison between levodopa and the drug discussed in this release. Also not mentioned are other treatment possibilities include dopamine agonists and deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure that sends electrical pulses to the brain and helps stabilize medication fluctuations. We think it would present a clearer picture had the release mentioned some of the other existing and newer emerging treatments for this condition.

Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready \u2013 even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,\"\" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week\u2019s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday \u2013 about 23,000 \u2013 was also well below last week\u2019s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it\u2019s time to reopen the economy in \"\"a gradual and safe way,\"\" Kelly said. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it\u2019s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide.

{"claim_id":9083,"hypothesis":"Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit","date_published":"October 6, 2017","explanation_1":"Editor\u2019s note: On the day this\u00a0 review was published, the news release it\u2019s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke. Figuring out ways to persuade them to stop has merit.","fact_checkers":"Sharon Dunwoody, PhD,Karen Carlson, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"It is not made clear what costs would accompany this kind of mobile health message strategy, and whether the costs would be absorbed by health plans and health care providers that use the service, or by individual patients.

We set out on a fact check. \u2018Apples To Oranges\u2019 Comparison? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development tracks homeless figures for each state based on point-in-time counts conducted every two years by local agencies. For 2005, HUD listed California\u2019s homeless population at 188,299, matching Newsom\u2019s figure. Last month, HUD released its 2019 report showing California had 151,278 homeless people, or about 37,000 fewer than in 2005. That also generally lines up with the governor\u2019s statement. But we found there\u2019s been a major change in how homeless people are counted since 2005. At that time, some communities, including Los Angeles County, would count the \"\"the hidden homeless,\"\" or those who were temporarily living in a motel or on someone\u2019s couch, in addition to those who lived on the streets, in cars, shelters or abandoned buildings. HUD stopped allowing the practice of counting the hidden homeless several years ago.

Advocates for homeless people have criticized HUD\u2019s methodology for not counting these less-visible individuals. They have said point-in-time counts, which are conducted on a single night at the end of January and largely by volunteers, tally only a fraction of the total homeless population. \"\"We know there\u2019s an epidemic, right?

For one, it\u2019s in more communities. \"\"It used to be more concentrated in specific areas. Now it is more dispersed,\"\" Rapport said. \"\"We see homelessness in every part of our state. \u2026 It\u2019s not just in our urban centers, it\u2019s in our suburban areas, it\u2019s in our rural areas.

In the past, the reports included a large number of \"hidden homeless\" individuals who were living temporarily in motels or with friends, but are no longer counted in current reports. This means that the comparison is not entirely accurate and leaves out crucial information."}
