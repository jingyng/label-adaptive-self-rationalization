The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate.","fact_checkers":"Jon Greenberg","premise":"\"Even before Donald Trump\u2019s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, \"\"Everything I say I\u2019m going to do folks, I do.\"\" It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We\u2019ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren\u2019t actually promises. We did not hear back. \u2018Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day\u2019 At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. \"\"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases,\"\" Trump said. \"\"My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\"\" The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, \"\"I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools.\"\" Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. \u2018Defund Planned Parenthood\u2019 Trump\u2019s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, \"\"Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,\"\" and then continued \"\"but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood.\"\" Trump\u2019s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. \u2018Repeal Obamacare\u2019 There doesn\u2019t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says \"\"On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\"\" \u2018Build a great great wall\u2019 Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn\u2019t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish \u2018a deportation force\u2019 There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said \"\"You\u2019re going to have a deportation force. And you\u2019re going to do it humanely.\"\" We couldn\u2019t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn\u2019t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, \"\"Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.\"\" Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, \"\"We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out.\"\" Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn\u2019t said if he would create a new deportation unit. While he might not be touting the same phrase, the result remains the same. \u2018Ban Muslims from entering the country\u2019 Immediately after the shootings by Muslim fundamentalists in San Bernardino in December 2015, the Trump campaign\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying, \"\"Donald Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\" Within a few days, Trump said\u00a0certain people would be exempted, including American citizens who are Muslim, foreign leaders, and athletes headed to competitions. However, according to the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0within his first 100 days \"\"the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place.\"\" That puts the ban firmly in the promise zone. \u2018Kill the spouses and children of our enemies\u2019 Trump said this during an interview on Fox and Friends, Dec. 2, 2015. \"\"The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,\"\" Trump said. In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump seemed to dial down this threat. O\u2019Reilly asked him if he would have killed members of the bin Laden family. Trump said \"\"I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer.\"\" Trump was pressed on this at the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. Asked how this policy would set the United States apart from ISIS, Trump said, \"\"We have to be much tougher.\"\" Trump finished his answer with, \"\"I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families\u2019 lives.\"\" While this could be a death threat, it isn\u2019t quite as clear as his original statement. Clearly, he wants to make family members suffer, but he doesn\u2019t say how much. Restore waterboarding and \u2018go further\u2019 In the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary, Trump said, \"\"I would bring back waterboarding and I\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\"\" Trump stood by his waterboarding policy on March 22, 2016, telling CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer he would \"\"go further.\"\" Trump has also said that \"\"torture works.\"\" The only caveat that Trump offered during his CNN interview is that he would listen to military officials\u2019 advice on the use of interrogation methods. Whether a Trump administration would ever use waterboarding, he has promised to keep it on the table. Our ruling A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five\u00a0of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques.

{"claim_id":"37567","hypothesis":"\"Players in the online \"\"World of Warcraft\"\" game were hit with an in-game virus, one that was later studied by researchers.\"","date_published":"March 9, 2020","explanation_1":"Was \u2018World of Warcraft\u2019 Once Hit by a Virus That Was Subsequently Studied by Researchers?","fact_checkers":"  Arturo Garcia  ","premise":"As the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus disease) continued to spread in March 2020, social media users flashed back to a \u201cpandemic\u201d that unfolded nearly 20 years earlier \u2014 but this one took place entirely in the virtual world.According to the Hong Kong-based tech news site AbacusNews.com, more people on the Chinese platform Weibo have begun researching the Corrupted Blood online virus and players\u2019 responses to the bug, which broke out inside the World of Warcraft game platform (known as WOW for short) in September 2005:A Weibo hashtag related to the World of Warcraft epidemic has become one of the most-searched terms, reaching nearly 60 million views. And one Weibo influencer spotted a similarity between their origins: The Wuhan coronavirus and Corrupted Blood both started in animals.\u201cOn the fundamental level, Corrupted Blood started with a hunter\u2019s pet, namely an animal, before it transmitted to a person,\u201d the Weibo user wrote.On Twitter, author Rin Chupeco garnered attention by highlighting the incident in a very popular thread and adding, \u201cEpidemiologists actually STUDIED this to see how ppl would react to an epidemic [in real life].\u201dThe Warcraft outbreak was an unintended side-effect of an update to the game involving the character Hakkar the Soulflayer, introduced for players in the online multi-player game to take down to complete a raid. One of Hakkar\u2019s attacks siphoned off players\u2019 characters\u2019 \u201cblood,\u201d weakening them to replenish his own strength. The game allowed for players to contaminate (or \u201ccorrupt\u201d) their characters\u2019 blood and thus poison Hakkar. But the tactic could also affect characters\u2019 in-game pet.Engineers for the game told PC Magazine in 2019 that the problem originated from a mistake by the design team; if a character\u2019s pet was in play at the time they poisoned Hakkar using that maneuver, the corrupted blood effect \u2014 and damage to not only the pet but any other character \u2014 would linger even after completing that part of the game.\u201cEvery time you\u2019d summon that pet you\u2019d reinfect yourself and all the players around you and it wouldn\u2019t check if you were in a raid so you\u2019d do it while you were in town and the entire town would get corrupted,\u201d said Shane Dabiri, chief of staff for the game\u2019s manufacturer Blizzard Entertainment. The effect was further spread by players who willfully \u201cinfected\u201d their characters, and then deliberately took them to other virtual sites on the WOW platform.\u201cEven once we figured out what was going on it made it really, really hard to fix it,\u201d Cash said:Our choices were either to go through every pet in every server in every country in the entire world and check if it had corrupted blood and get rid of it, or get really hacky code in where every time you summoned a pet it would check and see if it had corrupted blood on it and get rid of it.At the time, an estimated 6.5 million players used the game platform. As Reuters would report in 2009, the corrupted blood outbreak, which lasted around a month, affected 4 million of them. But the situation also prompted researchers to take note.In a March 2007 article for the journal Epidemiology,\u00a0physician Ran D. Balicer from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel called the purposeful spread of corrupted blood by WOW players \u201cthe first virtual act of bio-warfare\u201d and drew parallels between that outbreak online and the public spread of other diseases in the real world:The role of an asymptomatic-yet-infective animal reservoir, for instance, is evident in avian influenza. Asymptomatic ducks had an important role in allowing this otherwise relatively lethal avian disease to become endemic in East Asia and spread to other parts of the world. Furthermore, attempts by game administrators to quarantine infected areas proved futile due to the ability of characters to rapidly teleport to distant lands. This is similar to the role of air travel in the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (ie, SARS).That same year, in a paper for Lancet Infectious Diseases, Tufts University professor Nina Fefferman and co-author Eric Lofgren from the University of North Carolina argued that because WOW players can be so immersed in the game, that their reactions could be used as a gauge for how non-gamers could react in the event of a real-world outbreak:The modern world has two distinct types of pathogens, real and virtual. Real pathogens are, logically, those that infect real organisms, many of which subsequently cause disease and become subject to the attentions of the medical and public-health professions. The second type of pathogen, the virtual virus, infects computers through software. The outbreak we have described marks the first time that a virtual virus has infected a virtual human being in a manner even remotely resembling an actual epidemiological event. As technology and biology become more heavily integrated in daily life, this small step towards the interaction of virtual viruses and human beings could become highly significant.More than a decade later, those respective analyses continued to hold true; Eric Lofgren, who as of March 2020 was working as an infectious disease specialist at the Washington State University veterinary teaching hospital, told the Canadian Broadcast Company that implementing planned outbreaks within virtual settings could provide data for how to combat viral diseases outside of them.\u201cIn the real world, we can observe people\u2019s behaviour, but we don\u2019t know everything about the rest of the universe. We don\u2019t know perfectly if you\u2019re sick or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a game, we can, at least in theory, know all of those things. They\u2019re programmatic; you can record them.\u201d","sources":"https:\/\/wow.gamepedia.com\/Hakkar_the_Soulflayer, https:\/\/journals.lww.com\/epidem\/Fulltext\/2007\/03000\/Modeling_Infectious_Diseases_Dissemination_Through.15.aspx, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Was+%27World+of+Warcraft%27+Once+Hit+by+a+Virus+That+Was+Subsequently+Studied+by+Researchers%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fworld-of-warcraft-corrupted-blood-virus_coronaflu%2F&via=erumors, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/if-you-misspell-berniesanders-com-as-berniesander-com-do-you-get-redirected-to-a-donation-page-for-the-biden-campaign\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fworld-of-warcraft-corrupted-blood-virus_coronaflu%2F, https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/laninf\/article\/PIIS1473-3099(07)70212-8\/fulltext, https:\/\/globalhealth.wsu.edu\/team\/faculty\/eric-lofgren, https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/radio\/day6\/coronavirus-impeachment-then-and-now-picard-returns-fruits-of-the-goop-lab-cbc-logo-designer-and-more-1.5437706\/a-virtual-plague-that-decimated-world-of-warcraft-could-hold-lessons-for-real-world-outbreaks-researchers-say-1.5437746, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fworld-of-warcraft-corrupted-blood-virus_coronaflu%2F, https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/how-blizzard-coped-with-world-of-warcrafts-blood-plague-and-other-early-disasters\/, https:\/\/www.abacusnews.com\/games\/wuhan-coronavirus-prompts-netizens-study-world-warcraft-epidemic\/article\/3047158, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fworld-of-warcraft-corrupted-blood-virus_coronaflu%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/art\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/rinchupeco\/status\/1236440629258801152?s=21, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-a-washington-dc-priest-expose-hundreds-of-churchgoers-to-coronavirus\/, https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/us-flu-virtual\/online-blood-plague-offers-lessons-for-pandemics-idUKTRE53Q4HI20090427, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fworld-of-warcraft-corrupted-blood-virus_coronaflu%2F","label":0,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":880}

Companies will provide expertise including 3D printing, parts manufacturing, assembly and business planning. An announcement is due on Wednesday, the sources said. Britain, like many other nations, is trying to boost the number of ventilators available to its publicly funded health service by using some from private hospitals and manufacturing more domestically if possible. Vacuum cleaner company Dyson said on Monday it was testing a ventilator and scaling up for volume production. It had been working around the clock with medical technology and development company, TTP \u2013 The Technology Partnership. Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked businesses to help make the devices over a week ago when he spoke to more than 60 manufacturing firms and organizations, including aerospace and automotive companies. A spokesman for Johnson said the government had been in discussions with more than 3,000 businesses and was focused on supporting established British manufacturers to increase production of already approved machines. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the necessary specifications available online, and have also been evaluating concepts and designs from businesses to understand other viable options for alternative models that we can progress,\u201d the spokesman told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re testing proof of concept from a number of suppliers with the support of a team of expert clinicians.\u201d  The pandemic has forced doctors in some countries to either ration or plan limiting access to critical care beds and ventilators, with many nations scrambling to make or buy more. Ventilators, which cost tens of thousands of dollars, are mechanical breathing devices that can blow air and oxygen into the lungs. They are crucial for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe COVID-19, the disease coronavirus causes.

{"claim_id":"8578","hypothesis":"China snake village scales down as coronavirus prompts wildlife trade ban.","date_published":"April 8, 2020","explanation_1":"Since China began frantic efforts to curb a coronavirus epidemic in late January, residents in the tiny snake breeding village of Zisiqiao have had to come to terms with a ban on wildlife trading, its lifeline for decades.","fact_checkers":"David Stanway","premise":"Zisiqiao employed hundreds of people to breed three million snakes a year. Now, the rows of wooden slats that housed the captive reptiles stand empty, and abandoned. The Chinese character for \u201csnake\u201d has even been removed from the sign on the front wall of a specialty snake meat restaurant on the village\u2019s edge. \u201cIn the village now, there\u2019s definitely no one breeding snakes,\u201d  said Yang Heyong, a 71-year old former breeder. \u201cIt must be because of the epidemic. Zhong Nanshan (China\u2019s top medical adviser) has already said it is related to bats and snakes!\u201d  Zisiqiao has been an unlikely centre of China\u2019s snake industry for nearly four decades. It is dotted with small factory farms and its \u201csnake culture\u201d museum is a tourist attraction. Snakes also form part of the village\u2019s informal economy, with families keeping them in backyard holds to sell to restaurants or traditional medicine traders. The global coronavirus pandemic is believed to have originated in exotic animals on sale in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. The broad consensus suggests SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats, and early research suggested it reached humans via snakes, but many say pangolin - also on sale in the Wuhan market - are a more likely culprit. China issued a temporary ban on the trade and consumption of wildlife on Jan. 23 and vowed to amend animal protection and epidemic prevention legislation to make that ban permanent. Thirteen provinces have implemented their own local regulations to ban wildlife consumption. In Zisiqiao, built along the edge of a canal about 200 kilometres (120 miles) from Shanghai, snake breeding permits were cancelled in January. Winter is the off-season and breeding normally begins in April or May, so the economic impact hasn\u2019t yet hit home. While some residents said they expected restrictions to be relaxed once the crisis ends, government officials insisted they were permanent, and even if new licenses are issued later this year, the criteria will be far stricter. \u201cAt the end of the epidemic, it still won\u2019t be permitted,\u201d said Lu Jinliang, vice-chief of the local village Communist Party. \u201cThey will have to switch professions, raise other species.\u201d  Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the snake trade was under scrutiny. A study by Wuhan University published last December looked at snakes collected from the city\u2019s seafood markets, including the one blamed for the coronavirus pandemic. China trades 7,000-9,000 tonnes of snake a year, and intensive farming may have enhanced the transmission of parasites and other infectious diseases, the study said. However, Yu Xuejie, professor of the School of Health Sciences at Wuhan University and one of the study\u2019s authors, told Reuters that he did not believe snakes were the origin of the coronavirus. Another paper published last month said that while the virus originated in bats, genetic evidence suggests snakes may have been the intermediary species.

{"claim_id":"18323","hypothesis":"\"The Obama administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"","date_published":"May 31, 2013","explanation_1":"U.S. Sen. Rob Portman says the Obama administration has put out more major rules than other recent administrations","fact_checkers":"Stephen Koff","premise":"\"Because we deal with lots of loose rhetoric at PolitiFact Ohio, we\u2019re attracted like a magnet to any claim that tries to actually quantify a political or ideological point. Ohio U.S. Sen. Rob Portman delivered such a tidbit during a conference call with Ohio reporters on May 23. Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\" We won\u2019t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, \u00a0healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these \"\"major\"\" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. If all regulations were counted, Obama\u2019s record would be nowhere near Portman\u2019s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. But Portman said \"\"major\"\" rules.\"\" \"\"Major\"\" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them \"\"economically significant\"\" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to \"\"major\"\" that there is no need to split hairs here. We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. One was provided by Portman\u2019s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. Portman\u2019s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama\u2019s tenure with the first three of Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president\u2019s term. Portman\u2019s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. A similar analysis by George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman\u2019s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama\u2019s first term. This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman\u2019s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"\"major\"\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term. This doesn\u2019t change the facts or statistics as stated by Portman: The Obama administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\"\"","sources":"http:\/\/www.foreffectivegov.org\/files\/regs\/reg_tsunami_that_wasnt.pdf, http:\/\/www.fas.org\/sgp\/crs\/misc\/R43056.pdf, http:\/\/research.columbian.gwu.edu\/regulatorystudies\/sites\/default\/files\/u43\/West-%20Pace%20of%20E.S.%20Rule%20Increased-2.pdf, https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2012\/oct\/18\/mitt-romney\/federal-regulations-quadrupled-under-obama\/","label":0,"subjects":"Ohio, Regulation, Rob Portman, ","__index_level_0__":1055}

The two companies told Reuters they had spent millions of pounds, which they cannot recoup, stockpiling millions of packets of insulin - used to treat diabetes - inside Britain and building new shipping and air freight routes. Their plans, formulated over three years, show the lengths companies across the continent are having to go to overhaul long-standing supply chains that may not survive Britain\u2019s biggest trade upheaval in half a century. \u201cThere is nothing comparable to this,\u201d Novo Nordisk\u2019s UK General Manager Sahota told Reuters of the Danish company\u2019s preparation. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented from a logistics point of view. We\u2019re preparing for the worst-case scenario, the most extreme.\u201d  With two Brexit deadlines already been and gone, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal by Oct. 31 - increasing the chance of a sudden departure that brings trade tariffs and customs checks with the continent for the first time in decades. The government\u2019s own planning shows that, in a worst-case scenario, lorries seeking to enter Europe at the French port of Calais could face delays of two-and-a-half days, creating supply disruptions that could last for months. That poses a real risk for the pharmaceutical industry which imports 37 million packs of drugs from Europe a month. According to the government, three-quarters come via that route. While Britain\u2019s GSK and AstraZeneca are world leaders in respiratory and cardiovascular treatments, Britain\u2019s insulin is imported. \u201cIn the case of pharmaceuticals, you can\u2019t just throw things onto a boat or a lorry, you have to test and validate these routes into the country,\u201d Fry told Reuters in his office to the west of London, adding they had backups to their backup plans. Both Sanofi and Novo Nordisk have reserved space on ferries going the longer route to eastern English ports to avoid the main Calais-Dover crossing if needed, and also air freight if required. \u201cWe anticipate that route is going to become congested so what we\u2019ve done is open up other routes,\u201d said Sahota. \u201cSo two other routes that we\u2019ve opened up are Denmark to Immingham (in north-east England) and Netherlands to Immingham.\u201d  SKY-HIGH STOCKPILES  Novo Nordisk, Britain\u2019s biggest insulin supplier, has tripled its warehouse capacity to hold 18 weeks\u2019 worth of stock - 3.8 million packs that piled high would stand 12 times the height of the London Shard skyscraper. Eli Lilly of the United States and France\u2019s Sanofi, the country\u2019s second and third-biggest suppliers, have similar stockpiles. Frustration is growing that while they dedicate huge resources to such preparation, they are spending less time on their normal jobs. \u201cWhen we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re not doing other stuff,\u201d Fry said. \u201cWe\u2019re not working on projects that will bring our most innovative products to the market. \u201cAlthough we are happy to do it, it is starting to weigh on our balance sheet, on our logistics, keeping all this additional stock in the country. It\u2019s not an ideal situation.\u201d       The companies are confident they will be able to guarantee the British supply of insulin to the around 1 million diabetes patients who need it. But some patients like Georgina from London, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes more than 30 years ago, have become increasingly alarmed as the chances have grown of Britain leaving the EU without a deal to govern their trading relationship. \u201cFor me, I can\u2019t tell you how worried I am about that. It\u2019s life-threatening for me,\u201d she said, declining to give her last name. She added that she also worried about older patients she encountered at clinics. The British government is organising a regular freight service reserved just for drugs as part of its preparations alongside industry for Brexit on Oct. 31. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to help ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted, including insulin,\u201d said the department of health and social care. The two drug companies did not say how much their Brexit preparations had cost, beyond many millions of pounds. With fixed contracts with Britain\u2019s health service, they cannot raise prices. Both Fry and Sahota have had to delve into arcane areas of transport. As part of their planning, for example, they have had to factor in how many drivers are needed to avoid breaking legally mandated rest laws, how long refrigerated lorries can operate in one stretch, and what happens in the event of fuel shortages. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d said Fry. \u201cI know more about ferry crossings now than I ever thought I would.\u201d","sources":"\/article\/us-britain-eu-insulin-factbox\/factbox-britains-insulin-providers-prepare-for-brexit-fallout-idUKKBN1W20MV","label":0,"subjects":"Health News","__index_level_0__":2544}
{"claim_id":"11437","hypothesis":"Resveratrol impacts Alzheimer's disease biomarker","date_published":"September 16, 2015","explanation_1":"Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.This news release from Georgetown University Medical Center does a thorough job laying out the main points of a resveratrol phase II clinical trial. It reasonably talks about the study\u2019s findings and design, while cautioning readers on how researchers must pursue further studies before recommending the drug. Given this cautious overall framing, we view the release\u2019s omissions as relatively minor. One concern is that the release could have put the potential benefits and the harms into better perspective. For example, readers aren\u2019t told how much levels of the biomarker (Abeta40) would normally decrease in Alzheimer\u2019s patients and how this compares to what was found in the study. Readers also don\u2019t know how many patients suffered from side effects from the concentrated supplement. It would also be interesting to know what existing Alzheimer\u2019s drugs already on the market can do and how resveratrol might compare. But for the most part, this news release \u2013 including its use of language \u2013 was appropriately tempered and very informative, hitting home the message that these research findings are preliminary. Note: We also looked at how this study was covered by Time magazine and CNN, and compared the framing of the results in this news release vs. the subsequent stories. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. It is a condition associated with aging, since most symptoms appear when people hit their mid-60s. Estimates vary, but experts suggest that more than 5 million Americans may have Alzheimer\u2019s, according to the National Institute on Aging. Many of these treatments concentrate not on reversing the disease, but on helping people maintain mental function, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow or delay disease progression. In addition, drugs on the market help only some patients and may be effective for only a limited amount of time. Consequently, any research highlighting a new drug candidate that prevents Alzheimer\u2019s or delays its onset would be newsworthy for both patients and clinicians. Since Alzheimer\u2019s is also a complex disease, having a variety of treatment options would also prove to be beneficial.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Ishani Ganguli, MD, MPH,Kevin Lomangino","premise":"Although resveratrol is found in some foods, it was tested here as an investigational new drug. This means that it is not available commercially in 1-gram pills. The news release points out this fact. The news release does a good job explaining how Abeta40 levels were stabilized in patients taking resveratrol in its purified form, pointing out that those \u201ctreated with increasing doses of resveratrol over 12 months showed little or no change\u201d in the biomarker. But we wish the news release could have quantified, or at least provided some indication as to the importance of, the decrease in Abeta40 seen in patients with worsening dementia. How big is the decline in levels? And is there a significant difference between that level and the baseline point? It would also have been great to see the caveat noted later in the piece (\u201cA decrease in Abeta40 is seen as dementia worsens and Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses; still, we can\u2019t conclude from this study that the effects of resveratrol treatment are beneficial,\u201d Turner explains.) mentioned sooner in the release. By talking about this biomarker in the lead sentence, the clear implication is that the finding suggests a benefit \u2014 only several paragraphs later do we learn that this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. The news release mentions resveratrol\u2019s most common side effects, which include nausea, diarrhea and weight loss. It would have been helpful to know how commonly these effects occurred. It also lists loss of brain volume as an effect, but states it could interpreted as either a benefit (since it could have reduced inflammation) or harm. The news release does a thorough job describing the context, significance and design of the study. It mentions the resveratrol clinical trial was a \u201crandomized, phase II, placebo-controlled, double blind study in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d It talks about why the researchers chose to study resveratrol (because it activates compounds known as sirtuins) and why the study is significant (the trial was the largest, longest and highest dose trial of resveratrol in humans to date). But as noted above, we can almost always find suggestions for improvement. The study\u2019s primary objective was to determine whether resveratrol was safe and tolerated at the 1-gram oral dose \u2013 not to see whether it was effective in the treatment of dementia in people with Alzheimer\u2019s. The release might have briefly explained the purpose of a phase II trial, as we felt this was not clear enough in the news release. In addition, the fact that resveratrol levels stabilize in these patients does not necessarily translate into better health, like prolonged life and better cognitive function. The use of the patient anecdote and of the word \u201ccure\u201d in one of the comments could give readers the wrong impression. The news release could have been a bit clearer when cautioning readers on extrapolating surrogate markers to primary outcomes, even though Turner is quoted as saying, \u201c\u2026still, we can\u2019t conclude from this study that the effects of resvertrol treatment are beneficial.\u201d But again, we applaud the release\u2019s overall careful characterization of the study, including that the findings \u201ccannot be used to recommend resveratrol.\u201d In a couple of instances, the release calls for further research. There is no disease mongering in the news release. And the news\u00a0release did a nice job bringing in a patient\/family story, though it might have been helpful to describe the symptoms associated with mild Alzheimer\u2019s to place this story in context. The news release discloses the funding source, which was the National Institute on Aging. The study\u2019s principal investigator R. Scott Turner, according to the disclosure statement attached to the original journal article, states he has received research support from Ceregene, Eli Lilly, Merck, Biogen Idec, Toyama, Elan\/Transition Therapeutics and Pfizer, as well as the NIH and the DOD. The news release doesn\u2019t list these disclosures, and says only that that Dr. Turner \u201creports no personal financial interests related to the study.\u201d We\u2019d argue that it would have been better to list those disclosures in the news release, since they were deemed important enough to include the journal manuscript. But since we couldn\u2019t easily find any indication that these companies are developing resveratrol-based drugs \u2014 which would be a clear conflict of interest \u2014 we\u2019ll give the benefit of the doubt and rule this Satisfactory. It would have been helpful to know what standard treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s are and how resveratrol could compare with these drugs in the future. According to the National Institute on Aging, several other drugs on the market \u2013 like Donepezil (Aricept\u00ae), rivastigmine (Exelon\u00ae), and galantamine (Razadyne\u00ae) \u2013 may help slow down cognitive decline, but do not change the underlying disease process. The release could have discussed the lack of great treatments, further supporting the importance of this work. The news release states resveratrol is not available commercially in the 1-gram oral form. The news release sends a clear message in the first paragraph on what this clinical trial brings to the existing body of knowledge. \u201cThe study Turner led\u2026 is the largest, longest and highest dose trial of resveratrol in humans to date,\u201d it states. The release also does a nice job of mentioning other research applications of resveratrol. The news release uses appropriate, neutral language and steers clear (for the most part) of sensational wording. The only potential deviation comes from the patient family quote, where the quoted individual talks about wanting to find a \u201ccure.\u201d The release in no way suggests that resveratrol might be such a cure, however we\u2019re not sure that the quotation adds much in the way of value to the release.","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/iStock_000020578673_Small.jpg,https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/review\/resveratrol-may-slow-alzheimers-not-in-this-study\/,https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/review\/over-the-top-headline-aside-cnn-frames-resveratrolalzheimers-study-in-cautious-accurate-language\/,https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/2015\/09\/where-does-the-hype-come-from-a-news-releasenews-story-comparison\/,https:\/\/www.nia.nih.gov\/alzheimers\/publication\/alzheimers-disease-fact-sheet","label":0,"subjects":"Academic medical center news release,Alzheimer's disease","__index_level_0__":6584}
{"claim_id":"9801","hypothesis":"Patient\u2019s own stem cells help heal heart, early research shows","date_published":"February 14, 2012","explanation_1":"The story did a better job than a competing WebMD story in covering most of the necessary ground to give readers a realistic assessment of this stem cell study. It described the actual study with an appropriate level of detail. However, it missed two important points that were noted in the WebMD piece: the lead researcher\u2019s conflict of interest and the fact that there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups. The use of autologous stem cells to repair damaged heart muscle has been studied previously with mixed results. This phase 1 study (designed to determine the safety of the stem cell infusions) was conducted in a small group of patients who had previously suffered a heart attack and now had evidence of heart failure. Although the survival of heart attack has improved, the residual effects (heart failure) remains an elusive target. This study demonstrated small but important changes in the area of the heart attack in the treated patients. One of the best aspects of this story is how it repeatedly shows what the researchers still don\u2019t know. Instead of presenting this as a breakthrough with a clear path to clinical application, the story uses phrases such as, \u201cwhy this is happening is still unclear.\u201d Somewhat puzzling however was the lack of improvement in the degree of heart failure in the treated patients as compared to controls. This important fact seems to have been missed in the story. Additional studies are necessary to see if in fact this approach actually improve heart function.","fact_checkers":"William Heisel,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Gary Schwitzer","premise":"It\u2019s too early to have a meaningful discussion of costs. The story does not provide a lot of hard data on benefits, and we would have liked to have seen more. For example, it says that \u201cabout half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months.\u201d But we appreciated some of the specific details it does provide, including: \u201cMarb\u00e1n says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] \u201c22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,\u201d which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).\u201d Having said that however, the story misses an important point. The patients treated with the stem cells did not have an improvement in their overall heart function. So while there appeared to be a considerable amount of regenerated heart muscle, it did not make any difference in the performance of the heart so that patients did not likely see any benefit to the procedure. The story at least mentioned harms. Another story on the study, by WebMD, did not. This one says, \u201cAfter 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.\u201d Competing coverage discussed a broader group of patients who had bad outcomes, although it is not clear that all of those outcomes were a result of the treatment. Pinpointing the cause of a side effect can be tricky, and given the lead researcher\u2019s financial interest in this stem cell therapy, we think stories should err on the side of providing more information about potential harms. The story did a better job than some of the other coverage of the study in explaining exactly what this study entailed and the study\u2019s limitations. The story says, for example, \u201cShe cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive.\u201d The story does not engage in disease mongering. It makes it clear that this was a study in a particular group of patients, not just any patient with heart disease. \u201cTo qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and \u201chad to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren\u2019t squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have, says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\u201d  The story could have sought a little wider circle of independent experts. But we thought the reporter elicited good comments from Sonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH\u2019s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, which funded the study. We have to give an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d here, though, because the story failed to mention the financial interest that the lead researcher has in the stem cell therapy. The press release for the study mentions this, as does a competing WebMD story. There is no discussion of alternatives in this story. One might think that the only option for heart attack patients is to wait around until stem cell treatments become available. Even an additional line about alternatives would have been appreciated. The story makes it clear not only that the treatment is experimental but that it has to clear many more hurdles before becoming a clinical option. The story improves on a competing WebMD story by explaining the novelty of this study. \u201cThis is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,\u201d says Dr. Eduardo Marb\u00e1n, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute. He says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues \u2013 like a salamander\u2019s new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged \u2013 doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet. Marb\u00e1n and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November. The story goes beyond the Cedars-Sinai press release.","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/review\/scarred-hearts-healed-after-heart-attack\/","label":0,"subjects":"heart attack,stem cells","__index_level_0__":5021}

Stoll","premise":"Groundskeepers cut the grass on the first fairway following the final practice round for the 2008 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, April 9, 2008. REUTERS\/Gary Hershorn From log splitters to snow blowers, the $15 billion outdoor power equipment industry sells tens of millions of oil-powered machines a year to U.S. landscapers, loggers, homeowners and a litany of other buyers. While lawn mowers get faster, snow blowers cover more ground and handheld products get lighter, their propulsion has barely changed beyond getting more mileage out of gasoline. This week, at the annual Green Industry and Equipment Expo in Louisville, Kentucky, manufacturers will once again unveil new equipment with some promise of a cleaner, greener future. \u201cWe do anticipate the trend moving in the direction of alternative energy,\u201d said Jeff Salamon, director of marketing at MTD Products Inc. \u201cSome customers do like the experience of being unencumbered by exhaust and gasoline.\u201d   However, the answers offered will likely be more of the same. \u201cGas engines, by and large, are the most efficient way to go,\u201d Briggs & Stratton Corp Chief Executive Todd Teske told Reuters in an interview shortly after a press conference to unveil the company\u2019s latest engine. Briggs & Stratton sells electric mowers, but only in Australia. For decades, garden and snow machines were a poster child for harmful emissions. In fact, when auto executives were confronted by regulators for their contributions to pollution, they pointed to the lawn industry as a more offensive culprit. In the mid-1990s, that began to change as the Environmental Protection Agency began pressuring engine makers with tougher standards. \u201cThese aren\u2019t your father\u2019s lawn machines,\u201d Kris Keiser, president of the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, said. At Briggs & Stratton, for example, Teske said emissions have been cut by 75 percent since the mid-1990s thanks to manufacturing upgrades and design improvements. Another 35 percent reduction will come in 2012. The auto and other industries are under constant pressure to raise fuel economy or tap new technologies because their customers often burn through dozens or more gallons of gasoline each month. As gas prices rise, so does the strain on pocketbooks. But outdoor equipment users don\u2019t face these pressures. \u201cPeople who use our products typically use no more than five gallons of gasoline per year,\u201d Keiser said. This lessens the likelihood that customers will demand huge advances in fuel economy or solutions that lessen their operating expenses. Even commercial landscapers here in Louisville do not seem to be budging, despite high weekly fuel costs. Wang Xiaoguang, general manager of Wenling Leo Garden Machinery Co \u2014 which claims to be the largest exporter of Chinese garden machines \u2014 is learning this lesson first hand. Standing at his exhibition booth, he talks about Leo\u2019s successful business of exporting electric mowers to Europe. \u201cThis customer is different,\u201d Wang said of the U.S. market which Leo has yet to crack. \u201cThey have different standards.\u201d   But some companies, including a handful of start-ups, aren\u2019t waiting for customers to change their minds. Lincoln Jore, a 28-year-old entrepreneur from Ronan, Montana, launched a new \u201cGasLess\u201d outdoor equipment company called Core Outdoor Power on Thursday aimed at commercial landscapers and higher-end homeowners. His first product, a $249 weed whacker weighing 11 pounds, is powered by an unconventional motor and lithium-ion battery that slips in and out of the machine so it can be charged on a separate dock. It will begin appearing at independent U.S. dealers early next year. The \u201cmarket has missed the mark on developing alternative energy products that meet performance expectations,\u201d he said. By 2013, Jore plans to have a broader range of products, including a lawn mower and leaf blower that don\u2019t use gas. But even the most established global players are finding it hard to turn the tide. Honda Motor Co sells thousands of hybrid snow blowers in Japan annually and is bringing a hybrid model to the United States. This model promises to be the Cadillac of its class, capable of clearing 83 tons of snow in an hour and sweep a city sidewalk in one pass. But, at $8,000, this machine is twice as expensive as the company\u2019s previous top-of-the-line model, and hybrid technology is driving up the cost. Honda\u2019s expectations for sales of the Japan-built hybrid are extremely modest, but it wants to test the market before committing to other alternative-energy models. If Wisconsin-based Ariens Co\u2019s experience during last year\u2019s tough winter is any indication, there may be hope for Honda. Ariens put on sale an electric snow blower priced 60 percent higher than a conventional model. The company sold out of its limited quantity of electric snow blowers amid heavy snowfall and tight industry capacity. Stihl Inc, which says it is the No. 1 seller of handheld outdoor power devices, is also branching out. It has a new lineup of chainsaws, leaf blowers, weed whackers and hedge trimmers that are powered by lithium-ion batteries. The products cost 30 percent more than conventional gas-powered versions and, while initial demand has outstripped expectations, the company said it is too early to break out specific sales results. Cub Cadet, a brand owned by MTD, has a lithium-ion-powered product line on display similar to those sold by Stihl, but demand so far is only from a \u201cfaction\u201d of customers, Salamon said. Still, Cub Cadet is poised for a shift at some point, even if it is slow going, he noted.","sources":" ","label":0,"subjects":"Environment","__index_level_0__":5085}

Initially declared by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on March 18, the national lockdown restricted the movement of people and led thousands of businesses to suspend activities, especially in the restaurant and hotel sector. Costa said remote working should continue in the next month to contain the spread of the disease but said public services should be \u201cre-established\u201d and that he hoped childcare centres could reopen. Costa also said the government had approved plans to ensure masks and hand gel were available en masse in the coming fortnight. \u201cIt is fundamental to give the Portuguese the confidence to leave their homes and for this we must make means of protection abundant,\u201d he said. The municipality of Portimao in southern Portugal and the Madeira Islands said they would distribute 250,000 masks to their populations from next week, after health authorities reported on Monday they were considering making the use of masks obligatory in closed public spaces.

Around 80% of Portuguese companies either still operating or temporarily shuttered by the outbreak have reported a sharp drop in revenues, at times exceeding 75%. The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday it expected Portugal\u2019s economy to contract by 8% this year, way above the central bank\u2019s prediction last month of a drop between 3.7% and 5.7%. \u201cIn 2020 we will lose a significant part of our gross domestic product, something that cost us so much in recent years,\u201d Portugal\u2019s Finance Minister Mario Centeno said at a parliamentary hearing on Thursday afternoon. Centeno, also Eurogroup chief, said Portugal continues to back eurobond joint debt issuance to tackle the economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic. Though the finance ministers of eurozone countries agreed an immediate rescue package worth half a trillion euros, member states are divided on how to finance subsequent economic recovery. \u201cEurope\u2019s position depends on the positions of member states and that\u2019s more complex because it depends on commitments between countries, with different paths, priorities, approaches and political situations,\u201d Centeno said.

{"claim_id":"11422","hypothesis":"New HPV vaccine offers greater protection against cervical cancer than current vaccine","date_published":"May 8, 2015","explanation_1":"This news release has several strengths. It carefully describes an important study comparing two forms of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and provides the reader with information on the potential impact of HPV infections. However, it doesn\u2019t deliver fully on several of our other criteria including costs, quantification of benefits, and harms. We also think that it is important from a public health perspective to discuss use of the vaccine in the context of screening programs for cervical cancer (e.g. Pap tests). While the release does mention screening, it does so only in passing. The vaccine can \u00a0greatly reduce the risk that immunized girls will develop cervical cancer in the future, but it cannot totally eliminate that risk, even when all three doses are administered. In addition, the rates of complete vaccination among eligible girls is not ideal, and a few words about the importance of completion would have added to the release. HPV infection occurs in just about every sexually active adult. In the vast majority of cases, its presence produces no lasting effects. Depending of the strain of virus and other factors, however, the virus can cause a number of genital conditions including genital cancers. A vaccine that lowers risk when administered prior to sexual activity in girls is a significant step toward reducing the burden of the disease. This release highlights the results of a study that compared two forms of the vaccine that target different HPV subtypes.","fact_checkers":"Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kevin Lomangino","premise":"The release is from the UK and likely written for a UK audience, which would expect the cost of the vaccine to be covered under the NHS vaccination program. (The release mentions that the current vaccine is covered by NHS.) However, the release does not provide any detail on what the vaccine costs per person or what the vaccination program costs NHS \u2014 which is something we think even readers in the UK would be interested in and deserve to know. For our U.S. readers, we\u2019d note that\u00a0the vaccine requires three doses and therefore three different office visits. The costs of the visits and the vaccines ($130-140 per dose) bring the total immunization cost to approximately $500. Insurance usually covers a portion of the costs, but patients may have copayments. The release headline says the new version of the vaccine is \u201cbetter\u201d than the existing version, and the study backs this up. As the release notes, \u201c\u0085Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\u201d But while \u201c97 percent effective\u201d sounds very impressive, what exactly does that mean? \u201c97 percent effective\u201d compared with what? The study published in the NEJM has the statistics that can put this into perspective. The paper notes the exact rate of disease that was observed in both the old and new vaccine groups: \u201cThe rate of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to [various HPV subtypes] \u2026 was 0.1 per 1000 person-years in the 9vHPV [new vaccine] group and 1.6 per 1000 person-years in the qHPV [existing vaccine] group.\u201d \u00a0For a more reader-friendly description, the release could have said the rates were 0.1 vs. 1.6 cases per thousand people in the study annually. In addition, the accompanying editorial in the NEJM rightly points to the less than spectacular successes to date in actually immunizing young and adolescent girls with three doses over 6 months. \u201cAt 57%, coverage for the first dose of HPV vaccination among girls 13 to 17 years of age lags behind coverage for other vaccines recommended for children 11 to 12 years of age by approximately 20 to 25 percentage points.\u201d Greater emphasis on the need to follow through with all three doses would have been welcome. The only mention of potential harms from the new vaccine come from a study author who says, \u201cThis is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers.\u201d \u00a0Indeed, the vaccine appears to be safe, but we think that a complete disclosure of the adverse events observed in the study would have been helpful. The conclusion in the research notes, \u201cAdverse events related to injection site were more common in the 9vHPV group than in the qHPV group.\u201d So yes, the vaccine is safe, but appears to have more issues at the injection site than the existing vaccines. This is important because not all girls carry through with all three vaccinations; the lack of follow-through may be related to pain on injection. The release notes that the vaccine has been approved by the US FDA on the basis of the study being reported on. It also provides some information about the study itself, noting that it was a \u201cclinical trial [comparing] the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. \u201d Ideally we should have been told it was a randomized double blind study and the study duration was 6 months. Some detail about the demographics of the women in the study would also have been helpful. However, we think the release provides enough information for readers to be assured of the study\u2019s overall quality. The release doesn\u2019t exaggerate the burden of HPV infection or cervical cancer. In fact, we think the release could have done more to create urgency around the need to vaccinate. The release points out that the study was funded by the manufacturer of the vaccine and that Dr. Cuzick was a coauthor of the study. The release does point out that there are two older vaccines that are available. It notes that\u00a0the quadrivalent vaccine protects against 4 strains of HPV, offering about 70 percent protection against cervical cancer, whereas the 9-valent vaccine protects against 9 strains and can prevent up to 90 percent of all cervical cancers. The release also mentions in passing that the vaccine can be discussed as part of a screening program in women ages 25 to 45. We feel that the release could have emphasized this more. The release makes it clear that the new vaccine is available in the US but not yet in the UK. The release makes it clear that the study is the first of its kind comparing two types of HPV vaccine. Quotes from Dr. Cuzik are enthusiastic but could not be described as unjustified. He says, \u201cThis is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019d add that while his statement may be accurate, the promise of the vaccine will only be achieved with higher vaccination rates","sources":"http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMoa1405044","label":0,"subjects":"Academic medical center news release,Cancer","__index_level_0__":8988}

I think that\u2019s great. I think that helps society. I think Orlando, Florida, is a little safer tonight. The tragedy is that more of them didn\u2019t die. The tragedy is I\u2019m kind of upset he didn\u2019t finish the job \u2014 because these people are predators. They are abusers. I wish the government would round them all up, put them up against a firing wall, put the firing squad in front of them and blow their brains out.\u201d  Jimenez later doubled down on his remarks, asserting again that Orlando had been made safer through the deaths of dozens of innocent nightclub patrons:  \u201cAs far as the Bible is concerned, they crossed a line. The sin they performed is worthy of death,\u201d he said. \u201cI realize our society doesn\u2019t take that, but that\u2019s what the bible says. If someone does something that\u2019s worthy of death and they end up dying, I\u2019m not gonna mourn them.\u201d \u201cI think [Orlando is] safer now because of these deaths, and the reason I think that is because I believe all of these homosexuals are pedophiles, and the Bible \u2014 see our culture and our society puts them in these categories \u2014 gay, lesbian, whatever, but that\u2019s not found in scripture. And I understand the world does not want to accept that, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m saying as a Christian, the Bible puts people in two categories: normal\/natural, unnatural.\u201d  As the Sacramento Bee noted, however, the Baptist church with which Jimenez is associated is an independent one (not \u201cSouthern Baptist\u201d) unaffiliated with any mainstream order of the Baptist faith:  Who is this preacher? Longtime leaders in Sacramento\u2019s faith community say they have never heard of him. On its website, Verity is described as an \u201cindependent, fundamental, soul winning, separated, King James Bible believing Baptist church.\u201d Verity does not appear to be affiliated with any order of the Baptist faith. That means Jimenez can say whatever he wishes without any accountability to a larger religious community. \u201cIt\u2019s like opening up a store and calling it whatever,\u201d said Jerlen Young-Nelson, media director for the National Baptist Convention, America\u2019s oldest and largest African American religious convention, which boasts an estimated membership of 7.5 million people. \u201cHe is a pastor because he calls himself a pastor,\u201d said the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. \u201cA pastor who is not accountable is a pastor who can actually facilitate an atmosphere of spiritual corruption. A lack of oversight serves as fodder for theologically erroneous teaching. Why do we legitimize every Tom, Dick or Harry like this? \u2026 I condemn his entire presentation.\u201d  Additionally, no scientific research supports a commonly claimed linkage between homosexuality and child molestation:  The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children. This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children, but there is no scientific basis for asserting that they are more likely than heterosexual men to do so. And many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.","sources":" ","label":0,"subjects":"Politics, orlando nightclub massacre","__index_level_0__":9754}
{"claim_id":"9931","hypothesis":"Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats","date_published":"May 11, 2011","explanation_1":"This story about Celebrex\u2019s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied\u00a0most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were\u00a0looking at a surrogate outcome,\u00a0and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more\u00a0precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short,\u00a0the story did end up providing enough information to advance the\u00a0reader\u2019s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch\u00a0polyps before they have a chance to progress to\u00a0cancer. Drugs that can\u00a0reduce the number of polyps that\u00a0develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established\u00a0risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn\u2019t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"The story manages to work costs into the discussion: \u201cAt a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, [Celebrex]\u00a0is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.\u201d The story reports the benefits in appropriate statistical terms, noting that \u201cnew polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.\u201d The story could also have given us the number of advanced polyps that were prevented in each group. And, as noted above under the \u201cEvidence\u201d criterion, the story should have explained that these differences in polyp incidence\u00a0might not translate directly to the number of actual cancers prevented. Since we\u2019ve already docked the points for this omission, however, we\u2019ll award a satisfactory here to recognize the appropriate use of absolute risk numbers. If we were tough on the \u201cevidence\u201d criterion grade, we go a little easy on this one. The story notes that Celebrex users were more likely than the placebo group to develop polyps once they stopped taking the drug, and it quantifies this risk appropriately in absolute terms. However,cardiovascular risk \u2014 which is the main concern with this drug \u2014\u00a0is described only in\u00a0relative terms. The story states\u00a0that those treated with the drug had a 66% higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. Although we acknowledge that this is a picky point,\u00a0the story should have\u00a0reported the absolute rate of these problems in both groups and the associated difference in risk. This would have helped\u00a0readers understand how common cardiovascular events were in the study overall and how concerned they should be about the increased risk in the Celebrex group. Nonetheless, because of the overall handling of harms and repeated mention of safety concerns, we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt. We appreciated this story\u2019s generally restrained take on the results, which included mention of \u201ccaveats\u201d right in the headline and some discussion of the study\u2019s\u00a0limitations. There\u2019s also a solid explanation of how one might balance benefits and harms of treatment, and the story ends with appropriate emphasis on the doctor-patient\u00a0relationship and the importance of shared decision-making regarding treatment. An important shortcoming, however,\u00a0is the failure to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint. The story should have been clearer about the fact that these were precancerous lesions\u00a0that were being assessed, and that\u00a0most\u00a0such polyps do not progress to cancer. The number of actual cancers prevented would likely\u00a0be lower than what\u00a0is suggested by the\u00a0study results. Although the story\u00a0does explain that polyps are not in themselves cancerous, but\u00a0\u201ccould lead to colorectal cancer,\u201d there should have been\u00a0more discussion of how this affects our interpretation of the results. A tough call, but we think we our observation is important. The story states that colorectal cancer strikes 1.2 million people each year. It probably should have specified that\u00a0this figure represents a global tally\u00a0and not the incidence in the United States. Since the story quotes an American researcher and the study appears in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, readers might assume that the statistics are also U.S. \u2013 centric. With that being said, neither this nor anything else\u00a0in the story rises to the level of disease-mongering. The story notes that the study was funded by Pfizer, maker of Celebrex, and includes commentary from an independent expert who didn\u2019t participate in the study. The story notes that most people should rely on colonoscopies to find colorectal cancer in its early stages rather than take a risky drug to prevent it. It also mentions the fact that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention\u00a0effects. The story states that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor remaining on the market in the U.S., so readers should know it\u2019s available. The story could have been more clear that the drug is available only by prescription and can\u2019t be purchased over the counter. There is appropriate acknowledgment of previous research on the potential for COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer. There was enough original reporting for us to be certain that this was not based on a press release.","sources":" ","label":0,"subjects":"Cancer,Reuters Health","__index_level_0__":7667}

On Dec. 14, a 44-year-old northern white rhino named Angalifu died at the same Safari Park, where he was being treated for age-related conditions. Angalifu\u2019s death brought the worldwide total of known remaining northern white rhinos down to five from six, with Nola in San Diego and four counterparts elsewhere, one at a zoo in Europe and three in preserves in Africa, Davis said. \u201cNola had a thick drainage coming out of her nose,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe vets swabbed the mucus, and cytology tests showed bacteria, so they began treating her with antibiotics.\u201d  The Safari Park vets also took blood for tests from the creature\u2019s tail, Davis said. \u201cShe\u2019s such a gentle animal, she lets the keepers work on her,\u201d she added. Northern white rhinos were driven to near extinction by poaching in Africa, where the animals\u2019 horns are prized for their supposed medicinal value. None of those remaining in captivity has reproduced. Semen and testicular tissue from the male northern white rhino have been stored in the hope that new reproductive technologies will allow recovery of the subspecies in the future, the zoo said. White rhinos rank as the world\u2019s heaviest land mammals after African and Indian elephants. There are only about 30,000 rhinos of all types left in the world, and a rhinoceros is believed to be killed by poachers somewhere in the wild every eight hours, the zoo said earlier this month.

The researchers\u2019 hypothesized mechanism (based on previous research on the chemical) was that capsaicin modulated a specific chemical pathway, called a transient receptor potential (TRP), known to induce cell apoptosis (in other words, death). Per the study: Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, which are membranous ion channels that conduct calcium and sodium ions, have been shown to influence cancer cell growth. [\u2026] While there are a number of TRP channels known to exist in breast cancer cells, the researchers sought to identify \u2014\u00a0by analyzing RNA sequences in numerous breast cancer tissue samples \u2014 the one that was most common to breast cancer cells, but that also was uncommon in other cells: There were only two TRP channels expressed in every tissue sample, namely TRPM7 and TRPV1. Because TRPM7 is known to be expressed in a large number of different other cell types, it could not be considered a suitable, specific target for cancer therapy. In comparison, TRPV1 is not expressed in such a broad range; furthermore, it is associated with breast tumor growth inhibition. The researchers then tested the ability of capsaicin either to kill or inhibit the growth of a specific cell line representative of the most aggressive form of breast cancer: We showed the induction of apoptosis and necrosis upon capsaicin stimulation. [\u2026] This induction led to the suggestion that activation of TRPV1 by specific ligands could significantly enhance breast cancer cell death, even in the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, triple-negative breast cancer. The mechanisms involved leading to apoptosis remain elusive. It is important to note, however, that the significance of this study\u2019s finding wasn\u2019t that capsaicin (and by extension spicy peppers) specifically fights breast cancer cells. It was that they identified and described a biological pathway for potential anti-cancer agents to exploit in breast cancer \u2014 chemicals that activate the TRPM1 channel: The current study revealed the expression profiles of human TRP channels in 60 different breast cancer tissues and cell lines and furthermore validated the antitumor activity of TRPV1 against SUM149PT breast cancer cells, indicating that activation of TRPV1 could be used as a therapeutic target. The use of capsaicin would come with a number of challenges. First, would be the problem of how you get it to the actual location of cancerous cells. The authors stated in a press release that \u201can intake via food or inhalation [would be] insufficient for this purpose.\u201d So anyone trying to sell capsaicin pills or a whole batch of spicy peppers for anti-cancer purposes would be trying to pull a fast one. Related to that issue is the problem that capsaicin, at least when ingested, is removed from the body really quickly. In the breast cancer study, the cell lines were exposed to capsaicin for 48 hours. When ingested orally by humans, however, capsaicin likely remains in your bloodstream for less than 90 minutes, as reported in a 2012 study published in Pharmacological Reviews: A recent study investigated thoroughly the human pharmacokinetic profile of 5 g of orally ingested C. frutescens, equipotent to 26.6 mg of pure capsaicin (this is the equivalent of eating 15 habanero peppers!). The group documented that capsaicin could be detected in plasma after 10 min [\u2026]. After 90 min, capsaicin could not be detected. [\u2026] Oral capsaicin has more relevance to molecular gastronomy than to any therapeutic options. According to the authors of the above review, intravenous injection of capsaicin is essentially too problematic to consider, as well: There are, to the best of our knowledge, no reports of capsaicin administered intravenously in humans; given the likely widespread adverse effects, this is just as well. Another issue is that capsaicin (in the very high concentrations that would be necessary for it to be efficacious, at least) might also produce carcinogens that play a role in other forms of cancer, including colon cancer, gastric cancer, and skin cancer. As reported in a review of the therapeutic uses of capsaicin, these effects may come from byproducts formed from the metabolism of capsaicin: Studies [\u2026] have shown that capsaicin is metabolized [\u2026] to aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylated products [and other reactive metabolites]. These by-products of capsaicin metabolism may be responsible for its carcinogenic properties.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Medical, cancer cure, food","__index_level_0__":400}
{"claim_id":"34334","hypothesis":"\"The Amish own 20 percent of the nation's \"\"puppy mills.\"","date_published":"November 28, 2017","explanation_1":"Because there are millions of unwanted pets in animal shelters, animal advocates generally encourage prospective pet owners to adopt from shelters and rescues instead of purchasing from breeders (but in cases where a breeder is preferred, HSUS also provides a checklist on how to find a responsible one). According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\u00a03.3 million dogs enter shelters every year, and of those, 670,000 are euthanized. These numbers have been in decline since 2011, owing to an increase in the number of pets adopted and lost animals successfully reunited with owners.","fact_checkers":"Bethania Palma","premise":"In late November 2017, a meme circulated on Facebook with the claim that the Amish community, a relatively small and isolated group of Christians who live throughout the American Northeast and Midwest and abide by the lifestyle and technology of a bygone era, own 20 percent of the nation\u2019s \u201cpuppy mills,\u201d a term used by animal advocates to refer to commercial dog breeding kennels:  It cannot be said with certainty what percentage of the nation\u2019s dog breeding for profit is done by members of the Amish community, because while some breeders are licensed and tracked by both their respective states and the federal government, many operate unregulated or illegally. According to the Humane Society of the United States, there are an estimated 10,000 licensed and unlicensed \u201cpuppy mills\u201d in the nation. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have the highest Amish populations, the vast majority of known commercial breeding kennels are in Lancaster and Holmes counties respectively; both counties have the nation\u2019s oldest and largest Amish population concentrations. According to Pennsylvania state records, there are 119 known commercial breeding kennels in Lancaster \u2014 although many are listed as closing, or have already closed. In Ohio, 134 of the state\u2019s total 268 breeding facilities are in Holmes County. The states do not track the religious views of the breeders. Amish people make up a small percentage of Americans, with an estimated population of roughly 300,000. But, according to animal welfare groups, the Amish are prolific dog breeders, and in many of those operations, dogs are kept in poor conditions. In May 2017, the Pennsylvania Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals rescued 27 dogs from an illegal breeder in Lancaster County, SPCA spokeswoman Gillian Kocher told us. At least two, a yellow Labrador retriever and a bulldog, were in desperate need of immediate veterinary care. All the dogs were rehabilitated and adopted into permanent homes, she said, and the SPCA has pressed charges against the breeder. According to the Humane Society, unlicensed breeders can mean terrible conditions for dogs, including neglect, untreated health problems, and dogs forced to produce litter after litter of puppies. HSUS\u2019s\u00a0yearly list of 100 \u201chorrible\u201d breeders includes accounts of everything from shivering, wounded dogs to a breeder still in operation even though she shot a dog in the head in 2008. According to HSUS, these breeders continue to operate despite receiving multiple warnings and citations from law enforcement.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Viral Phenomena, amish, animal abuse, animal memes","__index_level_0__":1126}

All products in question were tested before being placed on our shelves, and we initiated over 200 additional tests in the past month to further confirm the safety of the shoes. All tests once again have shown these shoes are safe and meet applicable standards.","fact_checkers":"Dan Evon","premise":"A series of Facebook posts claiming that jelly sandals (or jellies) sold at Walmart stores contain a dangerous amount of lead circulated in June 2017, such as the following post: BEWARE PARENTS! I took Adelynn to her well checkup the other day and her routine lead screen came back positive. They took a capillary sample from her toe and the first test resulted in a 14.3 and on repeat it was 8.6 (a normal result is less 3.3) of course I was shocked and began racking my brain for what could be the cause. After a google search I saw some people talking about their kids having a positive lead screen from wearing Walmart jellies. Adelynn was wearing these Walmart jellies the day of her screen. I bought a lead test from Lowes and sure enough the jellies tested positive for lead. We had a venous sample drawn to see if she was absorbing it systemically but the results aren\u2019t back yet. UPDATE! The health dept called me today and said that her serum lead levels were thankfully normal! So it was obviously something her skin came into contact with. Am I 100% sure it was these shoes\u2026no\u2026but these $5 shoes are not worth the stress. Sadly, Walmart and jellies aren\u2019t the only culprits here and I encourage all parents to just be aware of things they put on their kids that aren\u2019t made\u00a0in the US. Similar claims\u00a0were made by other Facebook users. One, for instance, reported that her daughter, who \u201cbasically only wears\u201d Jellies, also demonstrated elevated lead levels:   None of the\u00a0postings holding that Walmart\u2019s jellies contained lead came from or cited an official source, such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Protection Agency, or Walmart, nor did they rely upon confirmed laboratory testing. Rather, one posting was based on a home test kit and the other on speculation. While some social media users asserted that they tested jellies and found that they contained unsafe levels of lead, others performed the same testing and found that the products were apparently safe:  Tamara Rubin,\u00a0a lead-poisoning prevention advocate, also tested the jelly shoes and found that they were lead free. It should also be noted that this rumor is based on\u00a0the testing of individual\u00a0products, and not all jelly sandals.

{"claim_id":"34879","hypothesis":"Actor Jimmy Stewart suffered what would in 2019 be diagnosed as PTSD due to his experience as a World War II bomber pilot.","date_published":"December 6, 2019","explanation_1":"Matzen\u2019s depiction of Stewart\u2019s state of mind as \u201cflak happy\u201d towards the end of World War II (a depiction reflected in Forney\u2019s viral Facebook post) was relatively thinly sourced, and involved only one direct quotation from a person who met the actor at that time.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In late 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of a viral Facebook post that presented an account of the actor Jimmy Stewart\u2019s military service during World War II. The post claimed a profound link between the trauma Stewart suffered from flying 20 combat missions over Germany and his ability to immerse himself in the role of George Bailey, the melancholic protagonist of the classic American film (and holiday favorite) \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d On Dec. 22, 2018, Ned Forney \u2014 a writer who devotes his Facebook page to personal histories and tributes to many U.S. military service members \u2014 posted one such account of Stewart\u2019s patriotism and dedication, and the emotional scars he bore from his sacrifice: For all the fans of \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life\u201d and Jimmy Stewart \u2026 Just months after winning his 1941 Academy Award for best actor in \u201cThe Philadelphia Story,\u201d Jimmy Stewart, one of the best-known actors of the day, left Hollywood and joined the US Army. He was the first big-name movie star to enlist in World War II. An accomplished private pilot, the 33-year-old Hollywood icon became a US Army Air Force aviator, earning his 2nd Lieutenant commission in early 1942. With his celebrity status and huge popularity with the American public, he was assigned to starring in recruiting films, attending rallies, and training younger pilots. Stewart, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. He wanted to fly combat missions in Europe, not spend time in a stateside training command. By 1944, frustrated and feeling the war was passing him by, he asked his commanding officer to transfer him to a unit deploying to Europe. His request was reluctantly granted. Stewart, now a Captain, was sent to England, where he spent the next 18 months flying B-24 Liberator bombers over Germany. Throughout his time overseas, the US Army Air Corps\u2019 top brass had tried to keep the popular movie star from flying over enemy territory. But Stewart would hear nothing of it. Determined to lead by example, he bucked the system, assigning himself to every combat mission he could. By the end of the war he was one of the most respected and decorated pilots in his unit. But his wartime service came at a high personal price. In the final months of WWII he was grounded for being \u201cflak happy,\u201d today called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). When he returned to the US in August 1945, Stewart was a changed man. He had lost so much weight that he looked sickly. He rarely slept, and when he did he had nightmares of planes exploding and men falling through the air screaming (in one mission alone his unit had lost 13 planes and 130 men, most of whom he knew personally). He was depressed, couldn\u2019t focus, and refused to talk to anyone about his war experiences. His acting career was all but over. As one of Stewart\u2019s biographers put it, \u201cEvery decision he made [during the war] was going to preserve life or cost lives. He took back to Hollywood all the stress that he had built up.\u201d In 1946 he got his break. He took the role of George Bailey, the suicidal father in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d The rest is history. Actors and crew of the set realized that in many of the disturbing scenes of George Bailey unraveling in front of his family, Stewart wasn\u2019t acting. His PTSD was being captured on filmed for potentially millions to see. But despite Stewart\u2019s inner turmoil, making the movie was therapeutic for the combat veteran. He would go on to become one of the most accomplished and loved actors in American history. When asked in 1941 why he wanted to leave his acting career to fly combat missions over Nazi Germany, he said, \u201cThis country\u2019s conscience is bigger than all the studios in Hollywood put together, and the time will come when we\u2019ll have to fight.\u201d This weekend, as many of us watch the classic Christmas film, \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life,\u201d it\u2019s also a fitting time to remember the sacrifices of Jimmy Stewart and all the men who gave up so much to serve their country during wartime. We will always remember you! Postscript: While fighting in Europe, Stewart\u2019s Oscar statue was proudly displayed in his father\u2019s Pennsylvania hardware store. Throughout his life, the beloved actor always said his father, a World War I veteran, was the person who had made the biggest impact on him. Jimmy Stewart was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and died in 1997 at the age of 89. It\u2019s a stirring account, and one firmly rooted in an accurate presentation of the basic sequence of events of Stewart\u2019s involvement in World War II. However, elements of the story \u2014 the claim that Stewart was removed from flying missions over Germany because he suffered from PTSD, and descriptions of him suffering nightmares of \u201cmen falling through the air screaming\u201d \u2014 appear to be rather thinly sourced and not corroborated in other accounts of the actor\u2019s military service. The version of events presented in the meme appears to have borrowed heavily from a 2016 book by the nonfiction writer Robert Matzen, called \u201cMission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe.\u201d The book charted Stewart\u2019s early career as an actor, his friendships and relationships, his family\u2019s history of military service, his famously close and affectionate bond with his father, and his entry into military service during World War II. However, the book attracted attention in the media for the revelatory claim that Stewart had suffered from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD, as a result of the horrors of flying 20 bombing missions over Germany, to such an extent that Stewart had to withdraw from combat missions, and that his trauma was visible to those on the set of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d Here\u2019s what Matzen wrote in the book itself about Stewart\u2019s state of mind after returning to Hollywood from the war: Jim Stewart was a man at sea, untethered by his old employer, yet also away from the regimentation of the service, the adrenalin rush, the striving toward great accomplishments, and the defying of odds with an extraordinary collection of brothers in arms who had become like sons to him. Combat fatigue and shell shock were the terms of the day for what eventually became known as post-traumatic stress disorder, but whatever the name, Stewart suffered along with millions of other combat veterans who had returned to homes the world over, to friends and family who just couldn\u2019t understand what they had experienced. On several occasions throughout the book, Matzen described Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d a World War II-era phrase for symptoms of anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares, and so on, which would now likely be diagnosed as PTSD. In one instance, he cited an interview he conducted with Lt. Barry Shillito, a fellow pilot and contemporary of Stewart\u2019s, as follows: \u201c\u2026 Shillito was shocked at the change in his old squadron commander. Stewart was gray of face, with bags under his eyes and a furrowed brow. His full head of hair had begun to recede and was half silver. Jim had grown so thin that the skin hung from his neck. It was almost as if Jim Stewart had been imprisoned like the others. \u2018He went flak happy there for a while,\u2019 said Shillito. \u2018He wasn\u2019t flying anymore and he was quieter than I remembered. '\u201d The specific claim that Stewart had suffered nightmares about \u201cplanes exploding and men falling through the air screaming\u201d appears to be of dubious origins. It comes from the prologue of Matzen\u2019s book, which is in several places written in an impressionistic style, mixing third-person narration with first-person, stream-of-consciousness prose, the latter a style that does not lend itself well to source-checking. The book reads: \u201cIn every newspaper, in every magazine were stories about families who didn\u2019t recognize the boys who had come home. This isn\u2019t my son. This isn\u2019t my husband; this isn\u2019t my brother. He\u2019s so cold, so distant, and the rages, the nightmares! \u201cOh yes, the nightmares came every night. There he was on oxygen at 20,000 feet with 190s zipping past, spraying lead and firing rockets, flak bursting about the cockpit. B-24s hit, burning, spinning out of formation. Bail out! Do you see any chutes? How many chutes? Whose ship was it? Oh no, not him! Not them! Bodies, pieces of bodies smacking off the windshield \u2026\u201d In the chapter notes, Matzen wrote the following about the sourcing for the prologue: \u201cThe prologue was written last and drew upon all the research that came before. I interviewed dozens of Armed Services personnel about the experience of coming home from wartime and their feelings of unreality and disconnectedness from friends, family and co-workers who couldn\u2019t possibly understand what had happened overseas.\u201d It\u2019s perfectly plausible that Stewart, who led and took part in multiple bombing missions, might have experienced nightmares or had traumatic memories of those difficult experiences. However, the \u201cexploding planes\u201d claim serves as a useful warning about describing what might be a general impression of the collective experience of World War II aviators as a specific experience that Stewart himself personally had. The Facebook post\u2019s claim that Stewart was \u201cgrounded for being \u2018flak happy'\u201d is also factually dubious. The broader assertion that Stewart had to fight to be allowed to fly combat missions, and play a more active part in the war, is fully corroborated in two other sources that we consulted: \u201cJimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind the Legend,\u201d a book by the film historian Michael Munn; and \u201cJimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot,\u201d a book by Starr Smith, an author and journalist who worked alongside Stewart as an Eighth Air Force intelligence officer during World War II. According to all three sources, the \u201chigher-ups\u201d within the U.S. military preferred to deploy Stewart\u2019s fame and widespread respect among the American population by using him for propaganda purposes, morale-raising exercises, and to encourage other young men to enlist. However, Stewart was persistent in requesting combat missions, and was eventually stationed in England where he led or took part in 20 bombing missions over Germany. Neither Munn nor Smith\u2019s accounts describe Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d \u201cshell-shocked,\u201d or suffering from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD. Neither account describes any nightmares or obvious trauma on Stewart\u2019s part, in detail, and neither book ascribes his supposed condition as the reason he was withdrawn from combat missions towards the end of the war. Rather, according to Smith, Stewart was promoted and moved in the spring of 1944, as part of what Smith describes in his book as a natural progression in his military career, given his frequently commended performance as a bomber pilot and squadron leader:\u00a0 \u201c\u2026 Toward the end of March [1944], the news came: Major Stewart had been promoted. After flying twelve missions with the 445th Group and commanding the 703rd Squadron, he was leaving to become the operations officer of the 453rd Group, at Attleborough, or Old Buc \u2026 When the appointment was announced, nothing was said about \u201cflying too many missions.\u201d The official word was that the 453rd needed an operations officer, and Major Stewart had been promoted to the job. I was then a combat intelligence officer with the 453rd, and met Stewart for the first time upon his arrival at Old Buc \u2026 Since then, I have been asked many times about it. I must say that I think it highly unlikely that Stewart\u2019s mission schedule and high command\u2019s efforts to \u201cprotect\u201d him had any bearing on his transfer and promotion.\u201d Smith speculates, in the book, that Col. Bob Terrill, with whom Stewart had a close affinity, might have lobbied for the transfer, but otherwise describes it as \u201ca routine air force change of assignment,\u201d adding: \u201cStewart was a mature, knowledgeable and experienced air force officer with an operational and administrative background. And a stellar combat record. He knew the territory. In short, he was ready for promotion. And deserved it.\u201d","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"History","__index_level_0__":1818}

Rittenhouse was arrested and charged after allegedly shooting three protesters, killing two of them:Kyle Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old from Illinois, was captured on video seconds after the first of two fatal shootings [on August 25 2020] during the third straight night of unrest in Kenosha over the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake. Still, questions remain surrounding Rittenhouse\u2019s presence at the protests and the moments leading up the gunfire.In a video on social media, Rittenhouse, seen carrying a semi-automatic rifle, appears to say he \u201cjust killed somebody\u201d while jogging away from a man who had just been fatally shot in the head.Rittenhouse, of Antioch, faces charges of first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide, among others, following the shooting, which took place amid turmoil after a Kenosha police officer shot Blake seven times in the back [August 23 2020], potentially paralyzing him. Rittenhouse was taken into custody in Lake County, Illinois, [on August 26 2020] and is scheduled for an extradition hearing on [August 28 2020]. He was officially charged [on August 27 2020].Video of an individual believed to be Rittenhouse, captured in the course of the chaotic incident, circulated on Twitter:(Warning, Graphic\/Violent) A crowd chases a suspected shooter down in Kenosha. He trips and falls, then turns with the gun and fires several times. Shots can be heard fired elsewhere as well, corroborating reports of multiple shooters tonight #Kenosha #KenoshaRiots pic.twitter.com\/qqsYWmngFW\u2014 Brendan Gutenschwager (@BGOnTheScene) August 26, 2020Rittenhouse\u2019s mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, has been mentioned in much of the extensive reporting on the shooting and her son\u2019s arrest. The Washington Post reported on August 27 2020 that Wendy and Kyle Rittenhouse lived in Antioch, Illinois at the time of the incident:Before the deadly shooting, Rittenhouse lived with his mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, a single mom and nurse\u2019s assistant, in a quiet apartment complex beside a park in Antioch, a bedroom community that sits just south of the Wisconsin border.According to court records reviewed by the Chicago Tribune, Wendy Rittenhouse sought an order of protection from police in January 2017, claiming that a classmate of her son\u2019s had been threatening him and calling him \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cstupid.\u201d The Washington Post was unable to reach her for comment.Mention of her attempt to obtain a protection order appeared in multiple articles, but little else was known about Rittenhouse\u2019s family. His father was not mentioned in any reporting we located.Kyle and Wendy Rittenhouse did not live in Kenosha at the time of the shooting; they were residents of nearby Antioch.Call the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Dept. and Ask for Deputy RittenhouseWe called the Kenosha County Sheriff\u2019s Department on August 28 2020 to ask about the rumor. However, no one was available for comment; we sent an email as well, but we have not yet received a response.On the Kenosha County website, a \u201cSheriff\u201d section provided information about the Department. A page on that site, \u201cAdministration (Home > Departments > Sheriff > Administration),\u201d included information about\u00a0Sheriff David G. Beth, as well as\u00a0Chief Deputy Marc Levin.Levin\u2019s portion showed that he was elevated to the position of Chief Deputy in 2017:Chief Deputy Marc Levin was hired as by the Department in July of 1990. In 2001 he was promoted to Sergeant after working for 11 years as a patrol deputy on all three shifts. As a Sergeant, Levin supervised first and third shift patrol until 2011 when he was promoted to Lieutenant and was in command of the Conveyance Bureau and a member of the Courthouse Security Advisory Committee.Levin was then promoted to the rank of Captain in 2015. Captain Levin commanded the Detentions Division overseeing the Kenosha County Detention Center and the Kenosha County Jail Pre-trial Facility. There he was responsible for over 200 full and part-time staff members.Chief Deputy Levin holds a bachelor Degree from the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee majoring in Criminal Justice.On January 4, 2017 Levin was promoted for the fourth time to the rank of Chief Deputy where he serves as second in command of the entire Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Department and is charged with administrating daily operations.No mention of a \u201cDeputy Rittenhouse\u201d appeared on the \u201cAdministration\u201d page of the Kenosha County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Neither was the page hastily changed in the wake of Rittenhouse\u2019s identification and arrest \u2014 it was most recently archived in March 2020, and the content was identical when we accessed it on August 28 2020.A search for \u201cRittenhouse\u201d across the entire site yielded no results on August 28 2020. Finally, a \u201cStaff\u201d page (Home >Staff Directory) did not mention anyone named Rittenhouse in the Kenosha Country Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s employ. Again, that page was most recently archived in March 2020, and no one with the surname \u201cRittenhouse\u201d was scrubbed from the page in August 2020.We replicated our searches on the City of Kenosha\u2019s website, yielding no results for \u201cRittenhouse.\u201d August 28 2020 reporting on Kenosha\u2019s Sheriff typically referenced Kenosha County, not the City of Kenosha. The only result for a \u201cDeputy\u201d on the City of Kenosha\u2019s website referred to a Deputy of Human Resources.VerdictA number of social media posts advised social media users to \u201ccall the Kenosha Sheriff\u2019s Department and ask for Deputy Rittenhouse,\u201d a directive we attempted to follow to verify the claim. Although we were unable to make contact by phone, we did send an email. Moreover, both the \u201cAdministration\u201d and \u201cStaff\u201d pages for Kenosha County and City yielded no results for the name \u201cRittenhouse.\u201d None of the posts provided evidence; due to the lack of any supporting evidence and extensive evidence showing otherwise but given the difficulty of proving negatives,\u00a0we currently rate this claim as Unknown.Comments","sources":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200304234116\/https:\/\/www.kenoshacounty.org\/Directory.aspx?DID=5, https:\/\/twitter.com\/Kathy5751\/status\/1299128872894697472, https:\/\/twitter.com\/BarinNelyse\/status\/1299225043545792512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.kenoshacounty.org\/Directory.aspx?DID=5, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-an-rnc-speaker-say-her-biracial-son-might-grow-up-to-be-a-large-intimidating-brown-man-and-her-biological-kids-to-be-white-and-nerdy\/, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdeputy-rittenhouse-and-the-kenosha-sheriffs-department%2F, https:\/\/archive.vn\/c98Ok, https:\/\/www.nbcchicago.com\/news\/local\/who-is-kyle-rittenhouse-what-we-know-about-the-17-year-old-arrested-in-kenosha-shooting\/2329610\/, https:\/\/www.kenosha.org\/departments\/human-resources\/131-hr-staff, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2020\/08\/28\/kenosha-sheriff-aclu-protests-rittenhouse\/, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2020\/08\/27\/kyle-rittenhouse-kenosha-shooting-protests\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27Deputy+Rittenhouse%27+and+the+Kenosha+Sheriff%27s+Department&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdeputy-rittenhouse-and-the-kenosha-sheriffs-department%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/BarinNelyse\/status\/1299225043545792512, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdeputy-rittenhouse-and-the-kenosha-sheriffs-department%2F, https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/*\/https:\/\/www.kenoshacounty.org\/549\/Administration, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdeputy-rittenhouse-and-the-kenosha-sheriffs-department%2F, https:\/\/www.kenoshacounty.org\/548\/Sheriff, https:\/\/twitter.com\/BGOnTheScene\/status\/1298502384654651392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdeputy-rittenhouse-and-the-kenosha-sheriffs-department%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sheree.williams.777\/posts\/3787822557903122, https:\/\/twitter.com\/Kathy5751\/status\/1299128872894697472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/t.co\/qqsYWmngFW, https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Kenosha?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.kenosha.org\/search?query=rittenhouse, https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/KenoshaRiots?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/the-august-27-tiktok-meme-explained\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/BGOnTheScene\/status\/1298502384654651392, https:\/\/www.kenoshacounty.org\/549\/Administration","label":1,"subjects":"Disinformation, Fact Checks","__index_level_0__":7465}

The former New York City mayor was referring to the FBI investigation into whether Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information when she was secretary of state.After a yearlong investigation, then-FBI Director James Comey\u00a0said\u00a0Clinton and her staff had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in handling \u201chighly classified information,\u201d but the FBI\u00a0\u201ccannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges\u201d against Clinton or any of her aides.\u201cAll the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here,\u201d Comey\u00a0said\u00a0at a July 5, 2016, press conference.Two days later, Comey testified before the House oversight committee, and Rep. William Lacy Clay of Missouri asked him, \u201cDid Secretary Clinton or any member of her staff attempt to obstruct your investigation?\u201d The FBI director replied, \u201cWe did not develop evidence of that.\u201dRegardless, in an attempt to favorably compare his client to Clinton, Giuliani claimed there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that Clinton committed obstruction of justice.Giuliani, April 21:\u00a0There was no obstruction. Nothing was denied [Mueller evidence]. Nobody crushed cell phones like Hillary did. Nobody deleted 33,000 emails like Hillary\u2019s people did, and nobody bleached a server like Hillary did.The FBI investigation found no proof that Clinton or her aides intentionally deleted \u201c33,000 emails\u201d by bleaching a server, crushing cell phones or any other method \u2014 contrary to Giuliani\u2019s claims.Let\u2019s go through the history of the case (which is also summarized in our story \u201cA Guide to Clinton\u2019s Emails\u201d).During a Republican-controlled House investigation into the deaths of four Americans\u00a0in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, the State Department learned that it had very few emails from Clinton, who was the secretary of state at the time. As it turned out, Clinton did not use a government email account and kept her work emails on a private server at her home in New York. In the summer of 2014, after Clinton had already left office, the State Department contacted her office in an attempt to recover emails on her server. Her lawyers went through the emails and identified\u00a030,490 work-related emails and 31,830 personal emails. In December 2014, about 21 months after she left office, Clinton gave the State Department the\u00a030,490 work-related emails\u00a0totaling roughly 55,000 pages. She indicated that she deleted the others. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any reason to keep them,\u201d she said at a\u00a0March 10, 2015, press conference.A Clinton lawyer told an employee of Platte River Networks \u2013 which was maintaining Clinton\u2019s private server \u2013 \u201cto modify the e-mail retention policy,\u201d so that emails 60 days or older would be deleted. That would have erased the personal emails that Clinton\u2019s lawyers did not turn over to the State Department at that time.However, the FBI\u00a0determined\u00a0during its investigation that emails identified by Clinton\u2019s lawyers as \u201cpersonal\u201d were deleted \u201csometime between March 25-31, 2015\u2033 \u2014\u00a0about three weeks\u00a0after\u00a0the House Select Committee on Benghazi served Clinton with a subpoena on March 4, 2015, to produce any emails related to its Benghazi investigation.Platte River Networks\u00a0used a free software program called BleachBit to delete the emails \u2014 which is what Giuliani means when he says the server was \u201cbleached.\u201d\u00a0Clinton and her lawyer told the FBI they were unaware when PRN deleted the personal emails. During its investigation, which\u00a0began July 10, 2015, the FBI tried to recover some of the deleted emails identified by Clinton\u2019s lawyers as personal.Some of the emails were recovered in \u201cthe mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server,\u201d but some could not be recovered because \u201cthe lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery,\u201d\u00a0Comey said at his July 5, 2016, press conference.Comey said that investigators \u201cfound no evidence\u201d that \u201cwork-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d\u201cWe have conducted interviews and done technical examination to attempt to understand how that sorting was done by her attorneys. Although we do not have complete visibility because we are not able to fully reconstruct the electronic record of that sorting, we believe our investigation has been sufficient to give us reasonable confidence there was no intentional misconduct in connection with that sorting effort,\u201d Comey said.The FBI director expanded on this point during his appearance before the House oversight committee two days later\u00a0in an exchange\u00a0with GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin.Grothman,\u00a0July 7, 2016:\u00a0Is it possible because of what her lawyers did that they were erasing things that were incriminating, maybe involving items that yourself were not particularly investigating but these have now been destroyed forever?Comey:\u00a0I guess it\u2019s possible \u2014 as I said in my statement on Tuesday, we did not find evidence to indicate that they did the erasure to conceal things of any sort. But it\u2019s possible, as I said on Tuesday, that there are work-related emails that were in the batch that were deleted.Grothman:\u00a0I\u2019m sorry, when you go to this length to make sure you can never recover the emails who are erased, wouldn\u2019t you think the intent is to make sure nobody looks at them again? Why \u2014 why \u2014 otherwise, couldn\u2019t you just (inaudible). \u2026Comey:\u00a0I guess it\u2019s a bit circular. You delete because you want to delete. But that \u2014 that \u2014 what I mean is we didn\u2019t find any evidence of evil intent and intent to obstruct justice.As for the \u201ccrushed cell phones,\u201d\u00a0the FBI said in its\u00a0notes on the investigation\u00a0(on\u00a0page 8) that Clinton used eight mobile devices while she was secretary of state. It quotes\u00a0Clinton aide Justin Cooper (on\u00a0page 9) as saying that he could recall on two occasions that he got rid of old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer.As we have written, security experts interviewed by the technology website Wired\u00a0said\u00a0destroying old devices is a good way to erase data \u2014 if done properly.Giuliani, as\u00a0Trump has done\u00a0before, suggests that Clinton or her aides intentionally destroyed the cell phones as part of a cover up. But, as Comey said, the FBI came to no such conclusion.In Trump\u2019s case, Giuliani said, \u201cThere was no obstruction.\u201d But the report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller didn\u2019t reach that conclusion. It said: \u201c[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.\u201dMueller also did not recommend, one way or the other, on prosecution, saying there were \u201cdifficult [legal] issues that would need to be resolved,\u201d to reach a conclusion about Trump\u2019s actions. But the report describes in detail 11 \u201ckey events\u201d in which Trump may have obstructed justice. It\u00a0\u201cfound multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.\u201d\u00a0In fact, the report establishes that Trump did try to influence the investigation but was unsuccessful mainly because his underlings refused to go along with his requests.Mueller report: The President\u2019s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. [Former FBI Director James] Comey did not end the investigation of [Retired Lt. Gen. Michael] Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn\u2019s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. [White House counsel Don] McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President\u2019s order. [Former campaign manager Corey] Lewandowski and [Trump campaign official Rick] Dearborn did not deliver the President\u2019s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President\u2019s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President\u2019s multiple demands that he do so. However, Attorney General William P. Barr, along with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, concluded that the investigation didn\u2019t show that the president had committed a criminal obstruction of justice offense. Among the 11 \u201ckey events\u201d in the Mueller report:Trump\u2019s behavior regarding the FBI\u2019s investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey,\u00a0\u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\u201d according to Comey\u2019s testimony. The Mueller report said, \u201cEvidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI\u2019s broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told [New Jersey Gov. Chris] Christie, that terminating Flynn would end \u2018the whole Russia thing.\u2019\u201dTrump\u2019s efforts to remove the special counsel. After\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported in June 2017 that the special counsel was investigating whether Trump had attempted to obstruct justice by firing Comey, Trump called White House counsel Don McGhan twice and ordered him to call Rosenstein and have Mueller removed as special counsel based on conflicts that Trump believed existed.Efforts to curtail the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Two days after Trump tried to have Mueller removed, the president asked his former campaign manager\u00a0Corey Lewandowski to deliver a message to Sessions to\u00a0limit the scope of the investigation to only foreign interference on\u00a0future\u00a0elections. Lewandowski ultimately asked Rick Dearborn, a senior White House official who had a relationship with Sessions, to deliver the message, but Dearborn didn\u2019t do so.Efforts to get the attorney general to take over the investigation. Trump repeatedly tried to get Sessions to reverse his recusal and take over the Russia investigation, and he wanted Sessions to investigate Hillary Clinton. In assessing the president\u2019s intent, the Mueller report said there\u2019s evidence Trump wanted Sessions to take control of the Russia investigation and \u201csupervise it in a way that would restrict its scope.\u201dTrump\u2019s conduct toward\u00a0Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman. In press interviews and on Twitter, Trump repeatedly said Manafort, who had been indicted on multiple felony counts, was being treated unfairly, and Giuliani floated the possibility of a pardon. \u201c[T]here is evidence that the President\u2019s actions had the potential to influence Manafort\u2019s decision whether to cooperate with the government,\u201d the Mueller report said, and Trump\u2019s public statements during the trial \u201chad the potential to influence the trial jury.\u201d As for intent, the evidence \u201cindicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government.\u201dFor more on these and other events detailed in the Mueller report, see our April 18 story \u201cWhat the Mueller Report Says About Obstruction.\u201dAs for Giuliani\u2019s claim that \u201cnothing was denied\u201d to the special counsel from the Trump administration, as \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace responded, \u201cthat\u2019s not true.\u201d\u00a0Trump refused to do an in-person interview with investigators, and the Mueller report said his written responses to questions, which included more than 30 \u201cdoes not \u2018recall\u2019 or \u2018remember\u2019\u201d instances,\u00a0were inadequate. Investigators considered a subpoena but didn\u2019t want to delay an investigation that had \u201cmade significant progress\u201d at that point. Giuliani said, \u201cWell, they are not entitled to testimony, no prosecutor is.\u201d Wallace responded: \u201cThat isn\u2019t what you said. You said they got everything they wanted.\u201dGiuliani disputed the Mueller report\u2019s conclusion that Trump directed White House counsel McGahn to remove the special counsel, claiming that McGahn \u201cgave three different versions of that conversation.\u201dAs the report lays out, though, despite pressure from Trump to recant his allegation, McGahn was consistent in maintaining that Trump told him to get rid of Mueller for alleged conflicts of interest.In the days after Mueller was\u00a0appointed\u00a0special counsel on May 17, 2017, Trump complained to advisers that Mueller had conflicts of interest that prevented him from conducting an impartial investigation. Several of Trump\u2019s advisers warned the president the claims of conflicts were baseless and \u201cridiculous.\u201d (We wrote about two of those in our April 19 story, \u201cDebunking Mueller\u2019s \u2018Conflicts.\u2019\u201c. )Nonetheless, the Mueller report states, Trump persisted, and directed McGahn to ask the Justice Department to dismiss Mueller over the purported conflicts. McGahn recalled that Trump directed him to \u201cCall [Deputy Attorney General] Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can\u2019t be the Special Counsel.\u201d McGahn said Trump told him, \u201cMueller has to go\u201d and \u201cCall me back when you do it.\u201d According to the report, \u201cMcGahn understood the President to be saying that the Special Counsel had to be removed by Rosenstein.\u201d Trump later told staffers he only wanted Rosenstein to review the conflicts. The conflicting accounts are a central piece of the report\u2019s consideration of whether the president sought to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about McGahn\u2019s revelations in the Mueller report, Giuliani dismissed them as \u201ca product of not telling the full story. That\u2019s not McGahn\u2019s fault. McGahn gave \u2014 when you read that, McGahn gave three different versions of that conversation.\u201dAccording to Giuliani, \u201cThe first version of that conversation is the president used the word \u2018fire\u2019 and he told the president, \u2018I\u2019m going to resign directly.\u2019 He then recants that and says no fire, no statement that I was going to resign and then he comes up with that version and then a third version which is even softer which says something like he should be fired. Or he has conflicts, he can\u2019t be special prosecutor. \u2026 It\u2019s a very complex set of facts.\u201dThe president disputes McGahn\u2019s account, Giuliani said. \u201cThe president says, \u2018I didn\u2019t say to fire him. I didn\u2019t want him to go, I want all the conflicts to be taken into consideration.\u2019 That\u2019s the president\u2019s version. You got to pick one version or the other.\u201dThere are, in fact, two versions: McGahn\u2019s and the president\u2019s. The report does not show McGahn \u201cgave three different versions\u201d of his conversation with Trump, as Giuliani claimed.On Jan. 25, 2018, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0that in June 2017 Trump \u201cordered the firing\u201d of Mueller, and that Trump backed down only after McGahn \u201cthreatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.\u201d The Mueller report notes that the following day the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0repeated\u00a0the essential claims in the\u00a0Times\u00a0story, but \u201cclarified\u201d that McGahn had not told Trump directly about his intent to resign rather than carry out Trump\u2019s directive. Although the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story did not say that McGahn directly spoke to the president about his threat to resign, the Mueller report notes that the\u00a0Times\u00a0story \u201ccould be read to suggest that McGahn had told the President of his intention to quit, causing the President to back down from the order to have the Special Counsel fired.\u201dBut contrary to Giuliani\u2019s assertion, even if McGahn was a source for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story (the story relies on several anonymous sources) this is not a different \u201cversion\u201d of events from McGahn. There is no evidence that McGahn ever told the\u00a0Times\u00a0that he told the president he would resign rather than carry out the president\u2019s directive.Nor does the report suggest that McGahn offered a \u201csofter\u201d version of Trump\u2019s directive, as Giuliani claims.The Mueller report details several attempts by Trump to get McGahn to walk back the\u00a0Times\u00a0report, with McGahn refusing each time.The first attempt came when Trump\u2019s personal counsel called McGahn\u2019s attorney on Jan. 26, 2018, \u201cand said that the President wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying that he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel and that he had threatened to quit in protest.\u201d McGahn\u2019s attorney responded that \u201cthe\u00a0Times\u00a0story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed,\u201d and that McGahn would not comply with Trump\u2019s request to dispute the story.Hope Hicks, a White House communications official, recalled that the same day, Trump directed White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders to contact McGahn about the story, but that McGahn again relayed that there was \u201cno need to respond\u201d to the\u00a0Times\u00a0article.Staff Secretary Rob Porter told investigators that on Feb. 5, 2018, Trump directed him to tell McGahn to \u201ccreate a record to make clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel.\u201d Porter said he recalled Trump saying, \u201csomething to the effect of, \u2018If he doesn\u2019t write a letter, then maybe I\u2019ll have to get rid of him.\u2019\u201dAccording to Porter, \u201cMcGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true.\u201d Porter said McGahn told him that \u201cthe President had been insistent on firing the Special Counsel and that McGahn had planned to resign rather than carry out the order, although he had not personally told the President he intended to quit.\u201d McGahn refused to write the requested letter.In an Oval Office meeting the following day, Trump told McGahn that the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story \u201cdid not \u2018look good\u2019 and that McGahn needed to correct it,\u201d the report states. According to McGahn, Trump told him, \u201cI never said to fire Mueller. I never said \u2018fire.\u2019\u201dThe Mueller report says the meeting then unfolded this way:Mueller report:\u00a0In response, McGahn acknowledged that he had not told the President directly that he planned to resign, but said that the story was otherwise accurate. The President asked McGahn, \u201cDid I say the word \u2018 fire\u2019?\u201d McGahn responded, \u201cWhat you said is, \u2018Call Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can\u2019t be the Special Counsel.\u2018\u201d The President responded, \u201cI never said that.\u201d The President said he merely wanted McGahn to raise the conflicts issue with Rosenstein and leave it to him to decide what to do. McGahn told the President he did not understand the conversation that way and instead had heard, \u201cCall Rod. There are conflicts. Mueller has to go.\u201d The President asked McGahn whether he would \u201cdo a correction,\u201d and McGahn said no. McGahn thought the President was testing his mettle to see how committed McGahn was to what happened. [White House Chief of Staff John] Kelly described the meeting as \u201ca little tense.\u201dGiuliani cites this account to claim McGahn gave different versions of his conversation with Trump, first claiming that Trump directed him to fire Mueller, and then offering another version \u201cwhich is even softer which says something like he should be fired. Or he has conflicts, he can\u2019t be special prosecutor.\u201d But this \u201cthird version\u201d is arguably the same, just with different words, with McGahn saying Trump told him, \u201cCall Rod. There are conflicts. Mueller has to go.\u201dIn his report, Mueller notes that Trump\u2019s rebuttals of McGahn\u2019s recollection were \u201ccarefully worded\u201d and that Trump focused on whether he had used the word \u201cfire.\u201d Mueller wrote that \u201csubstantial evidence supports McGahn\u2019s account that the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed\u201d and that Trump\u2019s \u201cassertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed \u2026 runs counter to the evidence.\u201dThe report states that McGahn has a \u201cclear recollection\u201d of Trump\u2019s directive: \u201cMueller has to go.\u201d And the report states, \u201cMcGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.\u201d The report notes that McGahn relayed to several White House staffers that in response to Trump\u2019s request, he had decided to quit, that he packed up his office and prepared to submit a resignation letter. \u201cThose acts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of Justice,\u201d the Mueller report states.The report also notes that Trump, through his counsel, already had brought his complaints about Mueller\u2019s purported conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice, so \u201cthe President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues that already had been raised.\u201dThe report concludes that \u201cthe President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel.\u201d","sources":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/transcript\/rudy-giuliani-rep-adam-schiff-on-whether-the-mueller-report-completely-exonerates-president-trump, https:\/\/vault.fbi.gov\/hillary-r.-clinton\/Hillary%20R.%20Clinton%20Part%2001%20of%2031\/view, https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/storage\/report.pdf, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/01\/25\/us\/politics\/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html, https:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/widgets\/share\/tool?canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2019%2F04%2Fgiulianis-obstruction-distortions%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtumblr%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug, https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/pr\/appointment-special-counsel, https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?c4793677\/comey-clintons-emails, https:\/\/www.factcheck.org\/2019\/04\/debunking-muellers-conflicts\/, https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjX-tS4xeThAhUIJt8KHaGqAH8QFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-moved-to-fire-mueller-in-june-bringing-white-house-counsel-to-the-brink-of-leaving%2F2018%2F01%2F25%2F9184a49e-0238-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html&usg=AOvVaw2ioEj0hODaVUz7aEQGKbCK, https:\/\/cdn.factcheck.org\/UploadedFiles\/Barr-letter.pdf, http:\/\/cdn.factcheck.org\/UploadedFiles\/2015\/03\/HRC-staff-QA-pdf.pdf, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2019%2F04%2Fgiulianis-obstruction-distortions%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug&t=Giuliani%27s%20Obstruction%20Distortions, https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/news\/pressrel\/press-releases\/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system, https:\/\/www.factcheck.org\/2016\/07\/a-guide-to-clintons-emails\/, http:\/\/time.com\/3739541\/transcript-hillary-clinton-email-press-conference\/, https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/news\/pressrel\/press-releases\/fbi-releases-documents-in-hillary-clinton-e-mail-investigation, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Giuliani%27s%20Obstruction%20Distortions&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2019%2F04%2Fgiulianis-obstruction-distortions%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug&via=factcheckdotorg, https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/09\/actually-clinton-destroyed-phones-better\/, https:\/\/www.factcheck.org\/2019\/04\/what-the-mueller-report-says-about-obstruction\/, https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?412315-1\/fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-hillary-clinton-email-probe&start=3853, https:\/\/www.factcheck.org\/2016\/10\/spinning-the-fbi-letter\/","label":1,"subjects":" Mueller report, Obstruction of Justice, ","__index_level_0__":7871}

Chasman has distributed a grinning photograph of the actor to the news media (absent glaring sunlight) that he said better represents Li\u2019s physical condition.","fact_checkers":"Bethania Palma","premise":"On 19 May 2018, a photograph of renowned action movie star Jet Li went viral online purporting to show the martial arts expert in \u201cfrail\u201d physical condition: So, apparently, Jet Li is suffering from \u201chyperthyroidism and spinal problems\u201d and this is him now \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude13: pic.twitter.com\/Ss0W2EL96D \u2014 sim\u00f3n (@StxNaty) May 19, 2018  The photograph caused an outpouring of concern for Li, who has a large international fan base, but the Beijing-born actor\u2019s manager said Li is in good health and the image was taken in particularly unflattering light. Li is also 55 years old, and the natural graying of hair associated with age coupled with glaring sunlight could have created an optical illusion making him appear to have aged rapidly. Although we have no medical doctors on staff who can diagnose a person by viewing a single photograph, we found no evidence that Li\u2019s health is in a downward spiral other than the fact he is abiding by the same rules regarding the passage of time as everyone else. Li\u2019s Los Angeles-based manager, Steve Chasman, attempted to dispel concern, telling the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0that the actor (whose real name is Li Lianjie) has a chronic condition, but he is otherwise well: He has hyperthyroidism that he\u2019s been dealing with for almost 10 years. It\u2019s nothing life-threatening and he\u2019s dealing with it. Speaking to USA Today, Chasman said LI is in \u201cgreat shape\u201d and the photograph, which was taken in Tibet, is being blown out of proportion: It\u2019s one picture and people are making these interpretations from it. If you took a picture me at the wrong angle and wrong time of the day, I could look frail as well. Perhaps adding to the illusion that Li has aged more rapidly than expected is the fact he now wears his hair shaved as opposed to the thick shock of hair seen in many of his movies. He also has taken to wearing round-rimmed glasses. According images and videos posted to his social media accounts, Li started sporting a bald head in 2017: Introducing #GSD to the world is my happiest moment in 2017, it was my pleasure to teach some basic #wushu steps to ambassadors from various countries. #jetli @jetli_com pic.twitter.com\/kC8AKC4jkG \u2014 Jet Li \u674e\u8fde\u6770 (@jetli_official) January 24, 2018  Although some news reports fretted that Li hasn\u2019t been seen on the big screen in recent years, he has simply has not been in the English-language arena. Instead, Li has been busy making Chinese-language films and television shows. He starred in and produced the action short film Gong Shou Dao in November 2017, playing the part of an old monk:  Hot take: Jet Li is focused on his charity work and is no longer working in front of the camera, so he\u2019s not dyeing\/augmenting his hair, or stuffing himself with HGH like other action stars his age.

{"claim_id":"34700","hypothesis":"\"Disputed parentage of a child born aboard a ship was resolved by listing the newborn as a \"\"son of the gun.\"","date_published":"September 7, 2002","explanation_1":"A more believable postulation for the origin of the term shifts the focus onto the occupation of the father and away from the location of the whelping (which fanciful lore would have us believe was on a deck between two guns, rather than in a cot in an officer\u2019s cabin or in a screened-off corner of the sick bay). In that explanation, \u201cgun\u201d refers to \u201csoldier\u201d (equating arms with the man, as it were), making any soldier\u2019s or sailor\u2019s male child \u2014 conceived in wedlock or not \u2014 a \u201cson of a gun.\u201d Alliteration (repetition of sounds) and well-cadenced rhymes were just as well-loved centuries ago as they are now, thus our forefathers would have delighted in \u201cson of a gun\u2019s\u201d inherent ear appeal in the same way we were slyly pleased by \u201cthe Thrilla in Manila\u201d and \u201cin like Flynn.\u201d","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"The faintly derogative epithet \u201cson of a gun\u201d has been documented as part of the lexicon of the English language since 1708, but no one can really lay claim to knowing how it began or what the phrase originally signified. Numerous interesting backstories have emerged in the centuries since, and it\u2019s possible one might even be the right one, but we no longer have any way of knowing. We can, however, dismiss some of the more fanciful \u201cexplanations\u201d that have come along: We can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above. First, wives and girlfriends (i.e., prostitutes) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time. Can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships, and how many extra rations they\u2019d have had to carry, if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along? And where did these women stay? There was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew (even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once), and women couldn\u2019t be out on deck where they\u2019d interfere with the operation of the ship. Were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time? Yes, some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives, but this happened infrequently at best, making the presence of non-passenger females (pregnant or otherwise) aboard sailing ships unusual. The vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard, thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women\u2019s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed. (Larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck. This is where the crew on such ships would sleep, not amidst the guns on the gun deck.) Second, we should look askance at the claim that when in port, and with the crew restricted to the ship, women typically gave birth aboard ship. Crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports, which we can fairly assume their home berths were not. And even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew (either to desertion or drunkenness) if they were let off the ship, the wives were under no such restrictions. Not being necessary to the running of the ship, nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth. Their husbands not only wouldn\u2019t accompany this hypothetical exodus, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to even if they could. In the era of sailing ships, the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now \u2014 dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on, but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere, and the farther away the better. Bringing babies into the world was considered wholly the province of women (doctors were summoned only if matters had taken a decidedly bad turn, and even then only rarely), and men were present at such events only when it could not otherwise be avoided. Men certainly did not voluntarily insert themselves into the proceedings, nor would their presence have been welcomed by the women straining to bring children into the world, the midwives attending them, and the array of female relatives that inevitably gathered by the bedside. Third, although a certain convoluted train of logic might tie the firing of large guns to hastening a difficult birth (e.g., inspiration by example, a cornerstone of sympathetic magic), there\u2019s no reason to believe anyone living in those times even tried this, let alone that the practice was so widespread that the firing of guns to ease childbirth begat a distinct phrase. Histories of life in the 1700s and 1800s are thunderous in their silence about this practice, and it can safely be assumed that quiet reflects a stunning truth about the matter \u2014 that whatever tales we\u2019re now telling ourselves, cannonfire wasn\u2019t being used to hasten babies into the world. Granted, gunfire had been employed in distant times to fend off disease (it never worked), so there is some historical basis for a tie between the discharge of firearms and medical emergencies. During the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia, many took to firing muskets both in the street and indoors under the mistaken assumption that introducing the acrid fumes of burnt gunpowder into the air would kill off the mysterious illness daily making away with hundreds of citizens. Such practice was even recommended by the city\u2019s government, so this wasn\u2019t even a case of a few badly-educated members of the populace seizing upon a fanciful notion; at the time it appeared to have the backing of the scientific community. However, it was the fumes of the spent gunpowder, not the report of the guns, that was supposed to effect the cure. In the realm of superstition, sudden noise is espoused as a way to drive away evil (we toll wedding bells for this purpose, and the New Year\u2019s Eve hullabaloo springs from that same wellspring of belief), but there is only one reported tie in that area of study between abrupt racket and the induction of labor, and it involves the ringing of church bells. Rather, the canon of superstition advises the loosening and opening of items to assist during a difficult childbirth: windows are to be flung open, doors unlocked, and shoelaces undone to help the impending mother in her travails. Nothing in superstition, however, advises frightening women into giving birth, much less introducing roaring cannons into the procedure. Another explanation for \u201cson of a gun\u201d ties the phrase to the reason for shotgun weddings \u2014 the child of such unions was deemed a \u201cson of the gun.\u201d That might seem a more reasonable origin, but that meaning did not appear in connection to the term until 1922.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Language, folk etymology, Phrase Craze, son of a gun","__index_level_0__":1596}
{"claim_id":"34678","hypothesis":"The red dye commonly used in nectar for backyard feeders is harmful to hummingbirds.","date_published":"September 12, 2003","explanation_1":"Some bird lovers fear the presence of their nectar dispensers will tempt the little birds to delay migration, causing coddled hummers to become trapped by the sudden onset of cold weather. Yet they need not so fearful, because the hummingbird\u2019s instinct to migrate is too strong to be sidetracked. When it\u2019s time to go, they know.","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"In the 1970s DDT, a highly effective pesticide then widely in use in the U.S., was believed to be threatening the continuation of a number of bird species. Reports claimed that bald eagles, ospreys, and peregrine falcons exposed to the chemical laid eggs with abnormally thin shells which broke during incubation and resulted in markedly fewer successful hatchings, so new generations were not surviving to replace earlier ones as older birds died off. Because of this looming extinction threat, DDT was subjected to a domestic ban in 1972. Once the pesticide was removed from the environment, the population levels of the endangered birds returned to near their previous levels. (Later studies indicated that factors other than DDT use were likely responsible for most of the decline.) Half-remembered fragments of the many news stories about the effects of DDT on those threatened raptors may have contributed to a related widespread conviction regarding hummingbirds \u2014 that the red dye commonly added to the nectar used in hummingbird feeders works to thin the shells of their eggs, placing them in similar jeopardy: Examples: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] This morning I got a stern lecture from the checkout lady at the grocery store because I was buying red food coloring to use in a hummingbird feeder. \u201cDon\u2019t you know red food coloring weakens their egg shells?\u201d she demanded. [Collected via e-mail, 2001] I have heard that the use of red dye in Humming Bird feeders will wipe out the family of the birds using the feeder in three generations. The dye is surposed to weaken the eggs. Or the suspicion could have been fueled by a more general wariness attached to red dyes, especially in the wake of the longstanding controversy over Red Dye #3, a colorant the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned for a number of uses of in 1990 after it was linked to the development of thyroid tumors in male rats. (Red Dye #2 has been banned by the FDA since 1976.) For whatever reason, many folks have come to suspect the color additive in hummingbird nectar poses a danger to the little creatures, with the \u201cIt thins the shells of their eggs\u201d belief heard most often as the specific harm wrought by the coloring. Others reasons claimed for avoiding red dye include a fear the substance will build up in hummingbirds\u2019 kidneys or livers, or that new hatchlings whose mothers partook of the sweet will be born blind or deformed. The red dye traditionally added to attract hummers to nectar dispensers may never have been necessary anyway. While it is true hummingbirds are drawn to red, there is more than one way to entice a bird. According to an entry found in the Audubon Society\u2019s FAQ: Current thinking is that the red dye may not be good for them, nor is it necessary to attract hummingbirds. The color on your feeder is enough to attract them. You can mix your own nectar using 1\/4 cup sugar to every 1 cup of water. The Audubon Society\u2019s page does not detail the harm it fears dye could potentially cause. We\u2019re unaware of any definitive study either linking the colorant to a particular illness in hummingbirds or demonstrating it to be harmless. Anecdotal evidence postulates a causal connection with beak and liver tumors. Rather than take a chance with the little birds\u2019 health, many bird fanciers have chosen to omit red dye from the liquid feed they offer their airborne visitors. A mixture of 1 cup of sugar to 4 cups of water makes a perfectly serviceable nectar. (Do not use honey in place of sugar, because it can promote the growth of a fungus that kills hummers.) Dye is unnecessary in the mix because the birds are already attracted to the red coloring of the feeders themselves. But do keep those feeders clean, because the sugar\/water mix can ferment fairly quickly in the summer sun, making it bad for the very wildlife it\u2019s meant to energize. The feeding of hummingbirds has attracted a second rumor, one of a more sinister nature: [Collected via e-mail, 2000] I heard that a man was recently arrested for cruelty to animals after starving a number of humming birds by putting out feeders with nutra-sweet in them. We haven\u2019t found a news account or other report of any such incident. Moreover, hummingbirds generally draw their sustenance from spiders, flies, gnats, and other insects they eat, not from the sweet nectar they sip. The sugary liquid provides extra energy to the birds, but it\u2019s not their primary source of nutrition.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Critter Country, hummingbirds, red dye, Wild Inaccuracies","__index_level_0__":2699}
{"claim_id":"34676","hypothesis":"Asparagus has miraculous cancer-fighting properties.","date_published":"March 18, 2009","explanation_1":"No evidence supports the popular rumor that asparagus has miraculous cancer-fighting properties.","fact_checkers":"Snopes Staff","premise":"An item about the supposedly miraculous cancer-fighting properties of asparagus has been bruited about the Internet since October 2006:  Asparagus\/Cancer Several years ago, I had a man seeking asparagus for a friend who had cancer. He gave me a photocopied copy of an article, entitled, \u2018Asparagus for cancer\u2019 printed in Cancer News Journal, December 1979. I will share it here, just as it was shared with me: \u2018I am a biochemist, and have specialized in the relation of diet to health for over 50 years. Several years ago, I learned of the discovery of Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S. that asparagus might cure cancer. Since then, I have worked with him on his project. We have accumulated a number of favourable case histories. Here are a few examples: Case No. 1, A man with an almost hopeless case of Hodgkin\u2019s disease (cancer of the lymph glands) who was completely incapacitated. Within 1 year of starting the asparagus therapy, his doctors were unable to detect any signs of cancer, and he was back on a schedule of strenuous exercise. Case No. 2, A successful businessman 68 years old who suffered from cancer of the bladder for 16 years. After years of medical treatments, including radiation without improvement, he went on asparagus. Within 3 months, examinations revealed that his bladder tumor had disappeared and that his kidneys were normal. Case No. 3, a man who had lung cancer. On March 5th 1971, he was put on the operating table where they found lung cancer so widely spread that it was inoperable. The surgeon sewed him up and declared his case hopeless. On April 5th he heard about the asparagus therapy and immediately started taking it. By August, x-ray pictures revealed that all signs of the cancer had disappeared. He is back at his regular business routine. Case No. 4, A woman who was troubled for a number of years with skin cancer. She finally developed different skin cancers which were diagnosed by asking specialist as advanced. Within 3 months after starting on asparagus, her skin specialist said that her skin looked fine and no more skin lesions. This woman reported that the asparagus therapy also cured her kidney disease, which started in 1949. She had over 10 operations for kidney stones, and was receiving government disability payments for an inoperable, terminal, kidney condition. She attributes the cure of this kidney trouble entirely to the asparagus. I was not surprised at this result, as \u2018The elements of Materia Medica\u2019, edited in 1854 by a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, stated that asparagus was used as a popular remedy for kidney stones. He even referred to experiments, in 1739, on the power of asparagus in dissolving stones. We would have other case histories but the medical establishment has interfered with our obtaining some of the records. I am therefore appealing to readers to spread this good news and help us to gather a large number of case histories that will overwhelm the medical skeptics about this unbelievably simple and natural remedy. For the treatment, asparagus should be cooked before using, and therefore canned asparagus is just as good as fresh. I have corresponded with the two leading canners of asparagus, Green Giant and Stokely, and I am satisfied that these brands contain no pesticides or preservatives. PROCEDURE: 1) Place the cooked asparagus in a blender and liquefy to make a puree, and store in the refrigerator. 2) Give the patient 4 full tablespoons twice daily, morning and evening. Patients usually show some improvement in from 2-4 weeks. It can be diluted with water and used as a cold or hot drink. This suggested dosage is based on present experience, but certainly larger amounts can do no harm and may be needed in some cases. As a biochemist I am convinced of the old saying that \u2018what cures can prevent\u2019. Based on this theory, my wife and I have been using asparagus puree as a beverage with our meals. We take 2 tablespoons diluted in water to suit our taste with breakfast and with dinner. I take mine hot and my wife prefers hers cold. For years we have made it a practice to have blood surveys taken as part of our regular checkups. The last blood survey, taken by a medical doctor who specializes in the nutritional approach to health, showed substantial improvements in all categories over the last one, and we can attribute these improvements to nothing but the asparagus drink\u2026 As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer. Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory,asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance. The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good.. It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body\u2019s most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants. While this piece claims to draw its information from a piece titled \u201cAsparagus for Cancer\u201d printed in Cancer News Journal in December 1979, we\u2019ve as yet been unable to locate a copy of that article or find information about either the e-mail\u2019s unnamed biochemist narrator or the article\u2019s purported authority, Richard R. Vensal, D.D.S. (It isn\u2019t clear what the \u201cD.D.S.\u201d stands for \u2014 that abbreviation is typically the short form for Doctor of Dental Surgery or Doctor of Dental Science, degrees one would not think would position their holders to perform groundbreaking work in the field of oncology.) It should go without saying that until far more is known about the 1979 \u201cAsparagus for Cancer\u201d article, that its purported miraculous tales of serious bouts of cancer overcome by asparagus therapy cannot be confirmed and thus should not be regarded as anything other than lore. However, that article\u2019s provenance aside, asparagus might indeed have certain anti-cancer properties. In addition to this vegetable\u2019s many other nutritional benefits (only 25 calories per serving, high in folic acid, plus a good source of vitamins A, B6 and C, calcium, iron, thiamin, potassium and fiber), it is high in the micronutrient glutathione, an antioxidant. Glutathione is said to defend the body against viruses, certain types of cancer, and boosts immune cells. Antioxidants have long been touted as one of the keys to preventing cancer. However, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) says of that conviction:  Considerable laboratory evidence from chemical, cell culture, and animal studies indicates that antioxidants may slow or possibly prevent the development of cancer. However, information from recent clinical trials is less clear. In recent years, large-scale, randomized clinical trials reached inconsistent conclusions. In other words, antioxidants may or may not be the potent cancer-fighters they\u2019re widely believed to be \u2014 the medical jury is still out on that subject. In fact, a 2018 study suggested that not eating asparagus might reduce the spread of cancer:  A study of lab mice found lowering levels of asparagine \u201cdramatically\u201d reduced the spread of triple-negative breast cancer. The researchers, who published their work in the journal Nature, used a number of methods to reduce asparagine levels in the mice, including changes to their diets. Cancer spread more when the mice were given asparagine-rich foods, which include dairy, beef, poultry, eggs, nuts, seeds and whole grains, among others. Fruits and vegetables contain low levels of asparagine. As for the notion that asparagus (or any other food) can actually help cure cancer, however, the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center noted:  According to our experts, a poor diet and obesity associated with a poor diet is a risk factor for the development of cancer. However, there is no evidence that certain foods alter the environment of an existing cancer, at the cellular level, and cause it to either die or grow.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Medical, asparagus, cancer","__index_level_0__":6406}

It may be present in trace amounts of some vaccines. It is potentially carcinogenic, but only in much larger amounts than would be in a vaccine. The antibiotics gentamicin sulfate and polymyxin b are in vaccines and can cause allergic reactions ranging from mild to life-threatening. Traces of these antibiotics can end up in certain vaccines, but would only cause a reaction in someone severely allergic. Genetically modified yeast, animal, bacterial and viral DNA in vaccines can be incorporated into the recipient\u2019s DNA causing unknown genetic mutations. Modified DNA can be used in the production of some vaccines, but is very unlikely to end up in the final product. Even if it did, there\u2019s no evidence it can cause mutations. Glutaraldehyde is in vaccines and is poisonous if ingested and causes birth defects in animals. There are trace amounts in some vaccines from manufacturing, and not enough to cause harm. Formaldehyde is in vaccines and causes cancer in humans among other issues and is banned from vaccines in most European countries. It\u2019s not banned in Europe. There are only trace amounts in certain vaccines and not enough to be carcinogenic. Latex rubber is in vaccines and causes life-threatening allergic reactions. Latex is used in the packaging of some vaccines, which could potentially cause harm if someone\u2019s strongly allergic to it. Human and animal cells from sources like aborted foetuses are in vaccines and are linked to childhood leukaemia and diabetes. They may be used in certain vaccines\u2019 production, but are unlikely to make it to the final product. Mercury (aka thimerosal or thiomersal) is in vaccines and can damage brain, gut, liver, bone marrow, nervous system and kidneys, is linked to autoimmune disorder, autism. Thiomersal isn\u2019t in any UK vaccines any more. This is down to concern around a slightly different mercury-based chemical. MSG is in vaccines and is linked to birth defects, developmental delays, infertility and is banned in Europe. It\u2019s not banned in Europe. It\u2019s used in some vaccines to stabilise them. There\u2019s no strong evidence it causes these problems in humans. Neomycin sulphate, an antibiotic, is in vaccines and can lead to epilepsy, brain damage and allergic reactions. Trace amounts of this antibiotic may end up in certain vaccines. If you are allergic to it could cause an allergic reaction. Phenol \/ phenoxyethanol is in vaccines and is used as antifreeze.

{"claim_id":"38992","hypothesis":"\u00a0 A Germanwings airbus crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people was an act of terror because Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam before the crash. ","date_published":"March 30, 2015","explanation_1":"Germanwings Pilot Had Converted to Islam-Investigation Pending!","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"There has been a lot of speculation about why Germanwings co-pilot Andrea Lubitz intentionally flew an airplane into a mountain, but there\u2019s no clear answer yet. The Germanwings airbus crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015. Two days later, Germanwings  said in a statement that the crash \u201cappeared\u201d to be a deliberate act by co-pilot Andrea Lubitz: \u201cWe are horrified to discover today that the aircraft that crashed in the south of France appears to\u00a0have been crashed deliberately \u2013 probably by the co-pilot of flight 4U9525. Based on audio taken\u00a0from the voice recorder, the French authorities have come to the conclusion that after the aircraft\u00a0had reached cruising altitude, the captain left the cockpit for a short time and was then unable to re-enter. It appears that the co-pilot, who had stayed in the cockpit, prevented the captain from re-entering by fully locking the cockpit door in order to then initiate the fatal descent. All Germanwings\u00a0and Lufthansa employees are deeply shocked. We could never have imagined that a tragedy like\u00a0this could occur within our company.\u201d It\u2019s not yet known why Andreas Lubitz would deliberately fly the plane into the side of a mountain. Early reports indicated that Lubitz had been treated for mental illness in the past and had previously attempted suicide. French authorities found a torn up sick note from a doctor that would have excused Andreas Lubitz from work on the day of the crash, but the reason for the note hasn\u2019t been revealed. Germanwings  said that Lubitz didn\u2019t submit the sick note to them. German officials said that Andreas Lubitz had hid \u201can unspecified medical condition\u201d from his employers, the Telegraph  reports: \u201cThe fact there are sick notes saying he was unable to work, among other things, that were found\u00a0torn up, which were recent and even from the day of the crime, support the assumption based on\u00a0the preliminary examination that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and his professional\u00a0colleagues. \u201cThe prosecutors said in a statement that the documents were found in searches of Lubitz\u2019s homes\u00a0in Duesseldorf and in the town of Montabaur in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. \u201cThe Uniklinik hospital in Dusseldorf confirmed that it had treated Lubitz in recent weeks but said it\u00a0was not for depression. \u201cMeanwhile Bild, the German newspaper, reported that \u2018Lubitz had a serious relationship crisis with\u00a0his girlfriend before the disaster and the resulting heartbreak is thought to have led to this.\u2019\u201d Just before the crash, Andreas Lubitz\u2019s pregnant girlfriend broke up with him. Her friends said Lubitz was a \u201ctormented and erratic man\u201d who suffered from unpredictable behavior and mood swings. He had also been having an affair with a Germanwings flight attendant in the months leading up to the crash, the Daily Mail  reports. Early indicators suggest that Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental illness and that led him to deliberately crash the airplane. Sill, other theories claim that it was an act of terrorism and that Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam. One of those  claims comes from the German blog site Pi-News: \u201cAll evidence\u00a0indicates that the copilot of Airbus\u00a0machine in his six-months break during his\u00a0training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and\u00a0subsequently either\u00a0by the order of \u2018radical,\u2019 ie. devout Muslim , or received the order\u00a0from the book of terror, the\u00a0Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this\u00a0mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of\u00a0the\u00a0investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that\u00a0he \u2014 as Mohammed Atta, in the\u00a0attack against New York \u2014 received his\u00a0instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque.\u201d That report has been repeated by a number of blog sites across the web. However, Pi-News isn\u2019t a trustworthy news source. The website  describes itself as against \u201cthe mainstream, America, Israel, basic and human laws and the fight against the Islamisation of Europe.\u201d Officials in France and Germany have not said that the crash could have been an act of terrorism, but the investigation is ongoing.

Discourse in the ensuing thread made no reference to cameras being switched off or malfunctioning that night or morning.In Google News, one of the top automatic queries was \u201cEpstein camera off\u201d as of August 12 2019. But that search only returned results repeating the rumor. On August 11 2019, the\u00a0New York Post tabloid reported:There\u2019s no surveillance video of the incident in which Jeffrey Epstein apparently hanged himself in a federal lockup in Lower Manhattan, law enforcement officials told The Post on [August 11 2019].Although there are cameras in the 9 South wing where the convicted pedophile was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, they are trained on the areas outside the cells and not inside, according to sources familiar with the setup there.The\u00a0Post relied on anonymous sources, and was clearly influenced by the rumors that spread the day before the article appeared. As is often the case with unsourced rumors or claims that originate on social media sites, a game of telephone style series of linkings occurred with no real delving into the substance of the rumors themselves.An undated\u00a0New York Magazine Intelligencer liveblog repeated the claim, citing the\u00a0Post as a source:There is apparently no video footage of what happenedThe New York Post reported on [August 11 2019] that no surveillance video exists of Epstein\u2019s death. According to the Post\u2019s sources, there are indeed video cameras in the section of the MCC where Epstein was housed on Friday night, but none target the inside or outside of the cells there.No other sources were cited. TMZ also referenced unnamed people about the cameras; those anonymous sources claimed there were no cameras in that area of the facility. However, TMZ\u2019s \u201csources\u201d were \u201cfamiliar with the facility,\u201d but weren\u2019t described as having information on Epstein\u2019s death itself:Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death may never be conclusively determined, because we\u2019re told standard practice in the area where he was detained is that cameras do not point inside cells.Sources familiar with the correctional facility in question tell TMZ, there are cameras in the Special Housing Unit \u2014 the SHU \u2014 but SOP is that cameras do not point into the cells. We\u2019re told cameras capture, among other things, the doors to each cell to determine if anyone walks in or out, but they don\u2019t point inside.One source familiar with the facility says the drill is for guards to pass by each cell in intervals ranging from 15 to 30 minutes depending on the circumstances.Epstein\u2019s death has presumably already been \u201cconclusively determined,\u201d given that his death was widely reported as having taken place. Other news articles indicated cameras were \u201cprevalent in the facility,\u201d but might not point inside cells. (By all accounts, Epstein was in an atypical housing unit. )On August 10 2019, before the rumor was as widespread, NBC News spoke to prison industry experts. At the time, they discussed the likelihood that a prisoner like Epstein would be under video surveillance:Bob Hood, a former federal Bureau of Prisons chief of internal affairs and former warden at the ADX Florence \u201csupermax\u201d prison in Colorado, said he also was perplexed by the decision to remove the suicide safeguards.\u201cUnder the circumstances, I would have a staff member sitting there or have a camera on him 24\/7 while he was in my custody, purely to cover my butt,\u201d Hood said. \u201cI know that sounds tacky, but this is not your average inmate.\u201dIn an August 10 2019 post about the rumor, Heavy.com noted that \u201cCoudrey did not provide proof to his tweet or any sources to verify why he wrote about the camera malfunction on Twitter,\u201d adding:He posted later on Facebook that reporters should be demanding the release of the camera footage. He wrote: \u201cReporters should be demanding the release of the camera footage. How this individual committed \u2018suicide\u2019 while on suicide watch and being monitored in prison is outrageous. Extremely convienent for the rich and powerful he was connected with though.\u201d [sic]A separate section of that article described Coudrey\u2019s background:Coudrey is listed on Twitter as being an entrepreneur, CEO of YukoSocial, and the co-founder of NewRightUS. YukoSocial is a company that helps people optimize their social media presence, according to the website. The site says: \u201cYuko Social is a team of millennial social media experts here to help with all your social media needs. Our team of specialists work to drive traffic, increase engagement and develop your brands online presence.\u201d [sic] Coudrey\u2019s Facebook page explains YukoSocial a little more, explaining that it\u2019s a political social media firm that specializes in \u201cinformation warfare\u201d and has a client list that includes U.S. Representatives, political figures, and candidate hopefuls. They are based in LA.Claims that cameras \u201cmalfunctioned\u201d at MCC on the night of Epstein\u2019s death appeared to originate solely with one individual on Twitter making baseless claims, with no stated source. When the rumor got legs, tabloids referencing each other or nameless sources with questionable links to Epstein\u2019s death reported the rumor \u2014 however, in true disinformation form, each of those claims took on different characterizations. In some, cameras malfunctioned or cameras were off. In others, the area was purportedly unmonitored. In any case, we found no credible reporting verifying that cameras had either malfunctioned or simply did not record the on the night that Epstein died.\"","sources":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Did+Cameras+Malfunction+in+Prison+the+Night+Jeffrey+Epstein+Died%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-cameras-malfunction-in-prison-the-night-jeffrey-epstein-died%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.tmz.com\/2019\/08\/11\/jeffrey-epstein-death-hanging-no-camera-special-housing-unit\/, https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2017\/jun\/02\/alt-right-celebrities-rally-portland-train-stabbing, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-netflix-really-cancel-the-oa\/, https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/prison-experts-are-stunned-angry-jeffrey-epstein-was-taken-suicide-n1041121, https:\/\/nypost.com\/2019\/08\/11\/theres-no-video-of-jeffrey-epsteins-apparent-suicide-sources\/, https:\/\/patch.com\/california\/beverlyhills\/marketing-ceo-michael-coudrey-threatens-author-over-defamation, https:\/\/heavy.com\/news\/2019\/08\/jeffrey-epstein-camera-malfunction\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-doc-from-fraggle-rock-also-doc-from-boondock-saints\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-cameras-malfunction-in-prison-the-night-jeffrey-epstein-died%2F, https:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2019\/08\/jeffrey-epstein-dies-by-suicide-report.html, https:\/\/vancouversun.com\/news\/world\/officers-worked-overtime-to-monitor-epstein-but-didnt-check-on-him-for-several-hours-before-death\/wcm\/3143b566-589f-46df-9418-120dff9d3481, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/disinformation\/, https:\/\/threadreaderapp.com\/user\/MikeTokes, https:\/\/twitter.com\/MichaelCoudrey\/status\/1046121628331966464, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-cameras-malfunction-in-prison-the-night-jeffrey-epstein-died%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/MichaelCoudrey\/status\/1160199691373621250, https:\/\/twitter.com\/MichaelCoudrey\/status\/1160199691373621250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/07\/06\/us\/jeffrey-epstein-arrest-sex-trafficking-indictment\/index.html, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-cameras-malfunction-in-prison-the-night-jeffrey-epstein-died%2F, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-cameras-malfunction-in-prison-the-night-jeffrey-epstein-died%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/donnie.ray.14606\/posts\/2387829798157040, https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/EpsteinFiles?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw","label":1,"subjects":"Disinformation, Fact Checks","__index_level_0__":6412}
{"claim_id":"8962","hypothesis":"New blood test detects early stage pancreatic cancer","date_published":"September 19, 2018","explanation_1":"The headline of this news release \u2014 \u2018New blood test detects early stage pancreatic cancer\u2019 \u2014 is misleading since the study results are quite preliminary, and the blood test was given to those already known to have cancer. For many readers the headline might suggest there\u2019s a new screening test currently available that can detect this very lethal cancer in anyone, when that\u2019s clearly not the case. The strength of this news release is that it firmly establishes the need for early diagnosis in this difficult to diagnose condition. Where it falls short is explaining what the main finding of detecting cancers with \u201c96 accuracy\u201d means, the significant limitations that place this impressive finding in a more appropriate context, and the potential influence of significant conflicts of interest among the authors. A very small minority of cases of pancreatic cancer are caught early. By the time it\u2019s usually diagnosed it\u2019s frequently quite advanced and much more lethal. Any test \u2014 blood-based or otherwise \u2014 that could catch this cancer early has the potential to improve survival \u2026 and be lucrative for developers. This news release teaches several lessons worth highlighting that we often find when blood tests are hyped as\u00a0 \u201ccatching cancer early.\u201d First, by design, these tests are first applied (retrospectively) to people already known to have cancer. Just how useful they would be in screening the general public requires larger (prospective) studies. And this brings up a second lesson: The most important information for doctors and patients alike is how good is the test at detecting a cancer that\u2019s there (specificity) and ruling out a cancer that\u2019s not there (sensitivity). Thorough coverage of such blood tests needs to scrutinize the specificity\/sensitivity, when possible. [For further explanation on\u00a0sensitivity\u00a0and specificity\u00a0see our toolkit article on the topic] Finally, as is the case with this study, the financial stakes involved are significant. Much of the research in early cancer detection is industry-funded. Reporters covering such industry-backed tests should make this clear to the public, as well as seek independent sources to comment on the study design and results.","fact_checkers":"Michael Joyce, MD,Andrae Vandross, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"Cost is not mentioned. Although the blood test is experimental, researchers would likely be able to provide a rough estimate of what such a 29-biomarker assay might cost. From the lead author: \u201cOur test can detect pancreatic cancer with 96% accuracy at stage I and II while there is still the possibility of successful surgical intervention\u201d Using \u201caccuracy\u201d without context is misleading for two reasons. First, it\u2019s not until the end of the news release that we learn that these impressive results are in people with already documented pancreatic cancer. Second, the 96% is somehow\u00a0correlated with specificity (number of true cancers picked up by the test) and sensitivity (number of true cancers missed). That means 4% of those with cancer will be missed by the test (but the paper reports 6% false-positives; again, confusing). Harms are not discussed and two types of harms are relevant here. The study \u2014 but not the news release \u2014 mentions a false-positive rate of 6%; that\u2019s the fraction of people erroneously diagnosed with a cancer they don\u2019t have. (Who might then go on to endure the costs and risks involved with subsequent evaluation.) The flip side would be: what\u2019s the false-negative rate? That\u2019s the number of people who are told they\u2019re cancer-free but really aren\u2019t. The potential emotional harm in this case is quite clear. This is important as well because pancreatic cancer is a rare condition. We know that a good screening test works best when the disease has high prevalence in a population, so when dealing with something rare, the 6% leading to harms may mean something very different. It should have been made more clear to readers that the blood test was given to people already known to have pancreatic cancer. The findings are much too preliminary to suggest that such a test could be used as a clinical screening tool\u00a0until it\u2019s validated by larger scale prospective studies. This makes the news release headline potentially misleading. This news release does not disease monger. It does quite well in establishing that an early detection method for pancreatic cancer is sorely needed since early clinical diagnosis is notoriously difficult with this very lethal cancer. It should have been shared with readers that nearly half the study authors have financial ties to Immunovia AB, the biotech company developing this IMMray\u2122 blood test for detecting pancreatic cancer. The lead author quoted in the news release is a co-founder of the company and the chairman of its board of directors. The release doesn\u2019t mention how pancreatic cancer is currently diagnosed \u2014 CT scan, biopsy, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9\u00a0blood test that measures the CA 19-9 level in the blood \u2014 and how this test might compare. At the very end of the news release we read: \u201cIn the future, the screening method could be used to screen people who are at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer, such as those with a hereditary risk, newly onset diabetes patients, and patients with chronic inflammation of the pancreas. The next step has already been initiated, which is a large US prospective study for high risk individuals.\u201d This is an important inclusion but it would have helped to put this higher up in the news release because it provides an opportunity to emphasize that the blood test is unproven as a screening tool. More importantly, it\u2019s currently not commercially available and the news release should have made this clear. The release doesn\u2019t specifically claim novelty, nor should it based on this very preliminary research. There are currently two other blood tests that are marginally useful (when taken in the context of other tests) in helping to diagnose pancreatic cancer or monitor treatment: CA 19-9 and CEA. There are no other existing blood tests that are routinely used by oncologists to diagnose pancreatic cancer. The preliminary nature of these findings render the headline phrasing premature and unjustifiable.","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/GettyImages-904252864.jpg,http:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/10.1200\/JCO.2017.77.6658,https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/toolkit\/tips-for-understanding-studies\/understanding-medical-tests-sensitivity-specificity-and-positive-predictive-value\/","label":2,"subjects":"blood test,Lund University,pancreatic cancer","__index_level_0__":7666}

Remember Our Gang? What ever happened to those people? Well, here it is\u2026\u2026\u2026..sad\u2026\u2026\u2026.. THE OUR GANG CURSE\u2026 Alfalfa \u2014 Carl Switzer was shot to death at age 31. Chubby \u2014 300-pound Norman Chaney died at age 22 following an operation. Buckwheat \u2014 William Thomas died at age 49 of a heart attack. Darla Hood \u2014 The Our Gang leading lady contracted hepatitis and died at age 47. Brisbane \u2014 Kendall McCormas, known as Breezy Brisbane, committed suicide at age 64. Froggy \u2014 William Robert Laughline was killed in a motor scooter accident at age 16. Mickey Daniels \u2014 He died of liver disease at 55. Stymie \u2014 Mathew Bear led a life of crime and drugs.

Pete the Pup \u2014 He was poisoned by an unknown assailant. and Spanky\u2026\u2026.Robert Blake is accused of murdering his wife (recently acquitted) In general, most \u201ccurse\u201d lists which supposedly document remarkably high levels of premature deaths and other tragedies of life within a group of people connected by some common bond should be taken as nothing more than frivolous entertainment because they are constructed through a number of misleading means: To amplify on that last point, we\u2019d explain it this way: If one were to choose any group of thirty or so people born in the U.S. in the 1920s and 1930s and follow them through the course of their lives, it wouldn\u2019t be the least bit unusual to find that several of those people died well short of the average life expectancies of their times due to disease, accident, homicide, or suicide. People get sick, die in accidents, and kill each other (or themselves) all the time \u2014 these are the facts of life, sad as they are. Such deaths may be tragedies, but they\u2019re hardly outside the pale of ordinary human experience. Before we launch into specifics, let\u2019s briefly run down the lives of the 29 child actors who were regulars (i.e., appeared in fifteen or more installments) of the 221 Our Gang comedies (also known as The Little Rascals) produced between 1922 and 1944. This information was compiled from Leonard Maltin\u2019s book (The Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang), the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), and various news accounts:  Frankly, the first thing that seems evident from this list is that the Our Gang bunch has been, on average, remarkably long-lived (especially considering that many of the men served in the military during World War II). Prior to a detailed analysis of their longevity, however, we should first dispose of a couple of names that don\u2019t belong on this list: So, what do we find? Analyzing the information about the 28 Our Gang child stars described above, we calculate the following: On the \u201ctragic\u201d side, we find that:","sources":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=","label":2,"subjects":"Entertainment, curse, Movies, our gang","__index_level_0__":1898}

Guttmacher, in 2011, said that the \"\"actual level of coverage is probably somewhere between\"\" its estimate and that of Kaiser. So NARAL is citing as gospel an old figure that even its authors undercut.\"","fact_checkers":"Sean Gorman","premise":"\"The General Assembly on April 3 narrowly approved an amendment by Gov. Bob McDonnell that will ban insurers participating in an upcoming federal health care exchange in Virginia from offering policies that cover most abortions. The action was disappointing to NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia. The group said, among other things, that McDonnell\u2019s proposal would force the exchange to offer more restrictive coverage than most private insurance plans. \"\"McDonnell\u2019s amendment prohibits Virginians participating in the new health exchange from purchasing any insurance plan that includes coverage for abortion -- coverage that currently exists as a standard benefit in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S.,\"\" NARAL said in a March 26 news release. Two Democrats running for lieutenant governor -- state Sen. Ralph Northam of Norfolk and Aneesh Chopra, former U.S. chief technology officer of the United States -- quickly sent out similar statements. We decided to check NARAL\u2019s claim that abortion coverage is standard in almost 90 percent of the private plans now being sold. We should note McDonnell\u2019s amendment has an exception that allows insurance companies on the exchange to cover abortions in instances of rape, incest or when a mother\u2019s life would be endangered by continuing a pregnancy. NARAL said it got the figure from a 2004 report by the Guttmacher Institute, an organization based in New York City that specializes in research on reproductive health issues. Although Guttmacher supports access to abortion and birth control, its research has been cited by both sides of the abortion debate. NARAL cited a Guttmacher synopsis that says the study examined abortion coverage through private insurance in 2002. It found that 87 percent of typical employer-based policies back then covered \"\"medically necessary or appropriate abortions.\"\" Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, said the definition of \"\"medically necessary or appropriate abortions\"\" is whatever a physician deems is required to protect the \"\"health or mental health of the patient.\"\" Guttmacher said its figure on private insurance coverage for abortion did not consider plans that offered benefits only in limited circumstances such as cases of rape, incest or to protect \u00a0the life of a mother. But the Guttmacher memo also noted another survey examining the issue came up with different results. That study, by Kaiser Family Foundation, found in 2003 that 46 percent of workers with employer-based insurance had coverage for abortion. The Guttmacher and Kaiser studies conducted early last decade offer the only detailed looks available on abortion coverage. Experts have not reconciled the difference in results. We spoke to Jon Gabel, a researcher who helped compile the 2003 Kaiser survey and now is a senior fellow at NORC, a social science research foundation at the University of Chicago. He said the 46 percent Kaiser cited refers to workers who were covered \u00a0for \"\"elective abortions\"\" that did not involve a medical emergency. Gabel said he interpreted Guttmacher\u2019s study as an examination of abortion coverage for medical necessity. Guttmacher, in a 2011 memo, essentially said the two studies asked different sets of questions that may have led to the different results. Guttmacher did not defend its original finding as definitive. \"\"The actual level of coverage is probably somewhere between the estimates made by Guttmacher and Kaiser, meaning that most Americans with employer-based insurance currently have coverage for abortion,\"\" the memo said. Our ruling NARAL said McDonnell\u2019s amendment banning an upcoming health care exchange from offering insurance plans that include abortion denies Virginians \"\"coverage that currently exists as a standard benefit in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S.\"\" NARAL bases its claim on a 9-year-old study by the Guttmacher Institute that found 87 percent of typical of typical employer-based insurance policies covered \"\"medically necessary or appropriate abortions.\"\" Contrary to NARAL\u2019s contention, the findings do not reflect coverage \"\"that currently exists.\"\" The research focused on policies that were offered in 2002.

The theory holds that together they were trying to suppress the supposedly highly effective drug Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 in favor of Remdesivir:  The disconnected statements offered in support of the conspiracy theory added up to nothing, but some of them individually had varying amounts of truth to them, which we briefly survey below. Some very preliminary research has suggested that Remdesivir, a drug originally developed to target Ebola, may show some promise as a treatment (not a \u201ccure\u201d) for COVID-19. The patent for Remdesivir is held by Gilead Sciences, a California-based biopharmaceutical company. In January 2020, the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the China Academy of Sciences applied to patent the use of Remdesivir in China. Even if that application were granted, it would have very limited scope and would not mean that China would \u201cown\u201d the patent to Remdesivir: \u201cEven if the Wuhan Institute\u2019s application gets authorized, the role is very limited because Gilead still owns the fundamental patent of the drug,\u201d said Zhao Youbin, a Shanghai-based intellectual property counsel at Purplevine IP Service Co. \u201cAny exploitation of the patent must seek approval from Gilead.\u201d Unitaid is an international organization that invests in innovations to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV\/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria more quickly, affordably and effectively.

In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, \"\"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\"\" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, \"\"Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.\"\" Reid continued, \"\"He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,\"\" said Reid. \"\"But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? \u2026 You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.\"\" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, \"\"As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years.

Romney added, \"\"Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign.\"\" Other Republicans leaped to Romney\u2019s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that \"\"I think he\u2019s lying\"\") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a \"\"dirty liar\"\" on ABC\u2019s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times\u2019 Frank Bruni called Reid\u2019s charges part of an \"\"unbecoming, corrosive game.\"\" \"\"Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,\"\" Bruni wrote. \"\"Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That\u2019s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.\"\" Many readers asked us to put Reid\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney\u2019s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he\u2019s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it\u2019s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney\u2019s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it\u2019s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, \"\"probably not.\"\" The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it\u2019s \"\"highly unlikely\"\" that he paid nothing. \"\"It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn\u2019t taxed until sold and may never be sold,\"\" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, \"\"But Romney\u2019s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It\u2019s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.\"\" Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it\u2019s theoretically possible, it\u2019s also \"\"preposterous.\"\" \"\"Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,\"\" the article said. \"\"But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.\"\" We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. \"\"I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,\"\" White said. Our ruling Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that \"\"the word is out\"\" when in fact it was only Reid who put that \"\"word\"\" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. !\"","sources":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_162-57486998-503544\/gop-chairman-harry-reid-is-a-dirty-liar-on-romney-tax-return-issue\/, https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_162-57486520-503544\/romney-to-harry-reid-i-pay-a-lot-of-taxes\/?tag=contentMain;contentBody, http:\/\/www.mittromney.com\/learn\/mitt\/tax-return\/2011\/wmr-adr-return, http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-congress\/2012\/08\/reid-extremely-credible-source-said-romney-didnt-pay-130987.html, http:\/\/www.mittromney.com\/learn\/mitt\/tax-return\/2010\/wmr-adr-return, http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2012\/08\/01\/did_romney_pay_zero_taxes\/, https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/CREC-2012-08-02\/pdf\/CREC-2012-08-02-pt1-PgS5901-5.pdf#page=1, http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/07\/31\/harry-reid-romney-taxes_n_1724027.html, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/08\/05\/opinion\/sunday\/bruni-truculence-before-truth.html?_r=1&ref=frankbruni, http:\/\/content.usatoday.com\/communities\/onpolitics\/post\/2012\/08\/harry-reid-mitt-romney-taxes-dirty-liar-\/1, https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-soi\/12insprbulhignincome.pdf, https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-soi\/08intop400.pdf, http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2010\/02\/17\/a-look-at-the-tax-returns-of-the-top-400-taxpayers\/","label":2,"subjects":"National, Candidate Biography, Taxes, Harry Reid, ","__index_level_0__":7440}
{"claim_id":"33835","hypothesis":"\"Buddy Holly's group named themselves \"\"The Crickets\"\" because the sound of a chirping cricket accidentally appeared on one of their recordings.\"","date_published":"May 9, 2000","explanation_1":"Although the account presented in The Buddy Holly Story about the origins of the name \u201cCrickets\u201d is complete fiction, it does have one small element of truth to it. When Buddy and the Crickets recorded the song \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Love You Too,\u201d a real cricket that had made its way into the recording studio did let loose with a chirp that was captured in the song\u2019s fade-out, and since the sound fit the rhythm of the tune quite nicely, it was left on the tape. This occurred in July 1957, however, several months after the group had already decided on the name \u201cCrickets\u201d for themselves.","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"The film The Buddy Holly Story depicts the name \u201cThe Crickets\u201d being bestowed upon Buddy\u2019s group by zealous Buffalo disk jockey \u2018Madman\u2019 Mancuso, who \u2014 after having locked himself in the studio while he plays \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d over and over \u2014 tracks down Buddy for a phone interview. Upon learning from Buddy that one of the songs the as-yet-unnamed group had recorded in Buddy\u2019s garage \u201chas a cricket on it,\u201d the DJ anoints them \u201cBuddy Holly and the Crickets\u201d:  Like much of the cinematic versions of The Buddy Holly Story, this scene is wonderful visual entertainment but bears little correspondence to the life of the actual Buddy Holly. The real story took place in January 1957, when Buddy Holly, having failed to achieve success as a recording artist for Decca Records (his first two singles had flopped, and the company had dropped his contract at the end of 1956), decided to give an independent New Mexico record producer named Norman Petty a shot at producing some recordings and promoting them to record companies. When Buddy and his group returned to Petty\u2019s studio for their second recording session on 24 February 1957, Buddy had decided that, in additional to taping a new composition of his entitled \u201cI\u2019m Looking for Someone to Love,\u201d he would have another try at performing a tune he had initially recorded for Decca the previous year, a song called \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day.\u201d  After the session, Petty chose the tape of this newer, speeded-up version of \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d as the song he would pitch to his recording industry contacts as a potential single. A very large obstacle loomed in the path of their plans, however: Buddy\u2019s contract with Decca prohibited him from rerecording any of the material from his Decca sessions for a period of five years, and this prohibition included the song \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d (even though Decca had declined to issue it on a record). It was Norman Petty who reportedly came up with the idea that if \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d were issued under the name of a group rather than under Buddy\u2019s name alone, Decca might not realize that the vocalist was a solo artist the label had once signed and dumped. Buddy and his bandmates (Jerry Allison and Niki Sullivan) were left to come up with a suitable group name, and inspired by the Spiders, one of Buddy\u2019s favorite rhythm-and-blues groups, they started flipping through the \u201cInsects\u201d section of an encyclopedia at J.I. Allison\u2019s house, as recounted by Niki Sullivan in the biography Remembering Buddy:  We were at Jerry\u2019s house, and everything we thought of [for a band name] had been used or didn\u2019t fit. So Jerry got an encyclopedia, and somehow we got started on insects. There was a whole page of bugs. We thought about grasshopper and quickly passed that over. And we did consider the name Beetles, but Jerry said, \u2018Aw, that\u2019s just a bug you\u2019d want to step on,\u2019 so we immediately dropped that. Then Jerry came up with the idea of the Crickets. He said, \u2018Well, you know, they make a happy sound, they\u2019re a happy type of insect.\u2019 I remember him saying, too, \u2018They make music by rubbing their legs together,\u2019 and that cracked us up. So we kept going and tried some other names, but finally we settled on the Crickets. The ruse took an ironic turn when Norman Petty, unsuccessful at pitching Buddy Holly\u2019s new version of \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d to several record companies, finally received a positive response from Bob Thiele, the head of A&R (artists and repertoire) at Coral Records. Since Coral was the home to such \u201cprestige\u201d acts as Debbie Reynolds and the Lawrence Welk Orchestra, Thiele decided to issue the Crickets record on Brunswick, a smaller sister label known mostly for its jazz releases and therefore more suited to \u201cfaddish\u201d rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music. The irony was that both the Coral and Brunswick labels were subsidiaries of Decca Records, whom Buddy was trying to \u201chide\u201d from. Although none of the Decca executives present when \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d was played for them initially recognized either the singer or the song (and Buddy\u2019s name was deliberately left off the Crickets\u2019 first contract), the smokescreen that hid Buddy\u2019s association with the group was dispersed before the record was actually released. After \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d had been bought by Brunswick, but before it was issued, Buddy Holly recorded \u201cWords of Love,\u201d a song Bob Thiele felt should not be hidden away on a minor label such as Brunswick. Accordingly, Thiele arranged to release \u201cWords of Love\u201d on Coral under the name \u201cBuddy Holly\u201d rather than \u201cThe Crickets,\u201d and when Buddy was signed to a Coral contract under his own name, his existing obligation to Decca came to light. After some grumbling about lawsuits, the situation was eventually resolved when Decca agreed to release Buddy from the obligations of his previous contract in exchange for his waiving his rights to any royalties from the earlier version of \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day.\u201d  (Throughout the rest of Buddy Holly\u2019s brief recording career, his music would appear on both records with the Crickets released on the Brunswick label and records credited to Buddy Holly alone issued by Coral.)","sources":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/?ie=UTF8&tag=urbanlegendsrefe&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=","label":2,"subjects":"Entertainment, Artists, music","__index_level_0__":5039}
{"claim_id":"10016","hypothesis":"Narcolepsy Drug Eyed for Cocaine Users","date_published":"April 25, 2006","explanation_1":"This story discusses modafinil (trade name Provigil) as a potential treatment for the withdrawal symptoms of cocaine addiction, such as fatigue, depression and lack of concentration. The drug may also blunt some of the desire for a cocaine \u201chigh\u201d. While modafinil is listed as \u201clegal\u201d, the drug is not yet approved to treat cocaine addiction. Only small pilot studies have been conducted on the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Modafinil is currently only approved to treat narcolepsy and other sleep disorders. The story provides no information on the cost of taking this medication daily, and no estimate of how long someone experiencing cocaine withdrawal would need to take modafinil. Treatment of cocaine addiction with modafinil is listed as new, and large scale, randomized clinical trails of the drug for this use have yet to be conducted. While early studies of the drug seem promising, the story gives no evidence regarding the effectiveness of this drug over other treatments and no information about the potential side effects of taking this drug. The discussion of modafinil allowing former cocaine addicts to \u201cthink strategically\u201d is an overstatement, as there is no evidence in the pilot study of improved decision making with modafinil. Insomnia is listed as a typical side effect of modafinil, but the story doesn\u2019t describe how common this is in people who take the drug for withdrawal symptoms of cocaine dependence. In the pilot study mentioned, side effects were twice as common in the treatment group, and included nausea, anxiety, tachycardia, loss of appetite and urinary tract infection. Only 40 of 62 patients completed the 8-week study, though side effects are not listed as the reason for 22 patients not completing the study. The story doesn\u2019t discuss any other pharmacological, psychosocial or behavioral interventions for cocaine abuse, although cognitive behavioral therapy was part of the treatment for all patients in the pilot study mentioned. While treatment of the biochemical and physical symptoms of cocaine addiction is important, there are other variables involved in drug abuse, including negative psychological and environmental factors that are not blunted by the use of modafinil or any pharmacological treatment. The pilot study principal investigator, who is interviewed in the story, is a hired speaker for Cephalon, maker of modafinil, though this is not mentioned in the article. The disclosure is readily available in the source journal article.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"No mention of the cost of taking modafinil daily. The story doesn\u2019t give any quantitative evidence of the benefits of this drug over placebo to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings for cocaine, though this evidence is provided in the journal article for the small pilot study. Abstinence from cocaine was measured as clean urine tests and of the 24 test required, 43% of the modafinil group vs. 24% of the placebo group were without evidence of recent cocaine use. Futher evidence from larger randomized trials is needed. The discussion of modafinil allowing former cocaine user to \u201cthink strategically\u201d might be an overstatement as there is no evidence in the pilot study of improved decision making with modafinil. The story doesn\u2019t mention the incidence of side effects in the pilot study or from other trials. Insomnia is mentioned in the story, but we\u2019re not told how common this is in people who take the drug for withdrawal symptoms of cocaine dependence. Side effects were twice as common in the treatment group in the pilot study and included nausea, anxiety, tachycardia, loss of appetite and urinary tract infection. The story doesn\u2019t give any quantitative evidence or any description of the pilot study. This was a randomized, double-blind study of 62 cocaine addicted patients (mostly male) taking modafinil or placebo for 8 weeks. Cognitive behavioral therapy was also part of treatment for both groups. Only 40 patients completed the 8-week study, though reportedly none dropped out due to side effects of the medication. No real evidence of disease mongering. The drug is promoted here to treat cocaine addiction and the incidence of this addiction is reported at 1.5 million in the U.S., however only about 250,000 were in substance abuse treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). The story doesn\u2019t mention any potential conflict of interest of the sources cited. Dr. Dackis is a hired speaker for Cephalon, maker of modafinil, though this is not mentioned in the news story. The disclosure is readily available in the source journal article. The story doesn\u2019t mention any other pharmacological, psychosocial or behavioral interventions, although cognitive behavioral therapy was part of the treatment for both the placebo and treatment groups in the pilot study conducted by Dr. Dackis and mentioned in the article. While modafinil is \u201clegal\u201d, it is still only FDA approved to treat narcolepsy and some cases of obstructive sleep apnea. The drug is also approved to treat shift work sleep disorders (i.e. the inability to adjust sleep hours due to overnight shift work), as this CNS stimulant has fewer side effects than caffeine or amphetamines. It is not yet approved to treat cocaine addiction. While the story explains the drug\u2019s current availability, it could have emphasized more clearly that the new use is still an unapproved use. Nonetheless, we give this a satisfactory score because of the cautions included in the story. Treatment of cocaine addiction with modafinil is described as new and large scale clinical trails of the drug for this use have not been conducted. This drug is thought to reduce some of the withdrawal symptoms of cocaine addiction, such as fatigue, depression and blunt the desire for the euphoria or cocaine \u201chigh\u201d.

A moderator kicked off the exchange by noting that TV ads in the race had made several claims about possible changes to Medicare and where the candidates stood on those changes. Pryor was asked, \"\"What specifically would you change about the current system, if anything?\"\" Pryor answered by parrying a charge that he had voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare by voting for Obamacare. (We have rated Cotton\u2019s earlier claim that Pryor \"\"cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare\"\" by $700 billion Half True.) In fact, Pryor said that Cotton \"\"has voted for that very same $700 billion (cut) he loves to criticize me for.\"\" (We rated a close variation of that claim True.) When given an opportunity to respond, Cotton took the questioner\u2019s claim head-on. Cotton said, \"\"The answer to your question is: I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement.\"\" We wondered if that was what his platform really shows. The answer hinges on two separate questions. First, Does Cotton support repeal of Obamacare? And second, if Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare either for current retirees or people approaching retirement? The short answers are yes and yes. Here are the more detailed explanations. Does Cotton support the repeal of Obamacare? Cotton\u2019s staff didn\u2019t return an inquiry from PolitiFact, but we found lots of examples of Cotton arguing that Obamacare should be repealed. \u2022 \"\"I will fight to repeal and replace Obamacare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions. \u2026 Obamacare must be repealed entirely.\"\" -- Cotton\u2019s House of Representatives office website, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. \u2022 I \"\"will fight to repeal Obamacare.\"\" -- Cotton\u2019s Facebook page, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. \u2022 \"\"What we have to do is repeal Obamacare, start over, and get it right.\"\" -- Cotton at a press conference with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Aug 21, 2014. \u2022 \"\"We would repeal Obamacare and replace it entirely with many reforms for our health care program.\"\" -- Cotton at a press conference, April 13, 2014 \u2022 And most clearly, a pledge Cotton signed that says, \"\"I pledge to vote for all bills which seek to REPEAL the health care bill, HR 3590, signed into law on March 23, 2010. To that end, I do now and will in the next Congress endorse and vote for all measures, including discharge petitions, leading to its defunding, deauthorization, and repeal. I shall do so whether those measures are taken for the whole of the bill or those component parts that impose mandates, restrict patient and doctor choice and access, violate individual freedom and privacy, reduce healthy competition, increase costs, or raise taxes.\"\" It\u2019s worth noting that, at times, Cotton has expressed a desire to \"\"replace\"\" the newly repealed law with something else. However, we\u2019ve failed to uncover an instance in which Cotton provided a detailed description of the Medicare policies that would be reinstated after a repeal. Cotton has also expressed an openness to more limited efforts, such as defunding the law, if a repeal can\u2019t be achieved. Still, it\u2019s clear from these comments that repeal is his first choice. Bottom line: Yes, Cotton has said consistently that he wants to repeal the law. If Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare for current beneficiaries? It would. The highest-profile element of the law that would disappear in the event of a full repeal is the closing of the \"\"doughnut hole.\"\" The law made strides to ease the previous, longstanding gap in coverage for beneficiaries in which they weren\u2019t able to get government subsidies for prescription drug purchases under Medicare Part D. However, this isn\u2019t the only example of a benefit included in the Affordable Care Act that would disappear for those currently on Medicare if the law is repealed and replacement provisions aren\u2019t specifically enacted. Here are others, gleaned from the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s summary of the health care law: \u2022 Elimination of cost-sharing for Medicare-covered preventive services. \u2022 Authorization of Medicare coverage of \"\"personalized prevention plan services,\"\" including an annual, comprehensive health-risk assessment. \u2022 Incentives to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to complete behavior-modification programs, such as smoking cessation. \u2022 Reduction in the out-of-pocket amount that qualifies an enrollee for catastrophic coverage for prescriptions. \u2022 Expansion of Medicare coverage to individuals who have been exposed to environmental health hazards from living in an area subject to an emergency declaration made as of June 17, 2009, and have developed certain health conditions as a result. \u2022 Prohibition of Medicare Advantage plans from imposing higher cost-sharing requirements for some Medicare-covered benefits than is required under the traditional fee-for-service program. In other words, current Medicare beneficiaries would feel a significant impact if a replacement law is not forthcoming after a repeal. We see no evidence that Cotton has pledged to protect any of these specific provisions in the wake of a repeal. Our ruling Cotton said that under his platform, he \"\"will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement.\"\" Cotton has consistently supported repeal of Obamacare, and while he has sometimes noted that something needs to be enacted to \"\"replace\"\" the law, we couldn\u2019t find any examples in which he specifically pledged to protect the Medicare policies that would be eliminated if the law was repealed, such as the closing of the doughnut hole and free preventive health-care services.\"","sources":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TomCottonAR\/info?ref=page_internal, http:\/\/www.arktimes.com\/ArkansasBlog\/archives\/2014\/08\/21\/mitt-romney-endorses-tom-cotton, https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2013\/nov\/19\/tom-cotton\/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep\/, http:\/\/www.medicare.gov\/pubs\/pdf\/11493.pdf, http:\/\/cotton.house.gov\/issues\/health-issues, https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2012\/aug\/15\/stephanie-cutter\/ryans-plan-includes-700-billion-medicare-cuts-says\/, http:\/\/www.arktimes.com\/ArkansasBlog\/archives\/2014\/04\/13\/tom-cotton-avoids-taking-stance-on-private-option, http:\/\/www.arktimes.com\/ArkansasBlog\/archives\/2014\/10\/14\/tom-cotton-absolutely-refuses-to-answer-questions-about-the-200000-arkansans-on-the-private-option-who-would-lose-coverage-if-obamacare-repea, http:\/\/kff.org\/health-reform\/fact-sheet\/summary-of-the-affordable-care-act\/, http:\/\/www.therepealpledge.com\/status\/full-list-of-signers\/, https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/andrewkaczynski\/gop-rep-tom-cotton-obamacare-repeals-not-gonna-probably-work#ax2xfr, http:\/\/www.katv.com\/story\/26786800\/pryor-cotton-live-debate-on-katv","label":2,"subjects":"National, Health Care, Medicare, Retirement, Tom Cotton, ","__index_level_0__":7643}

In the videos, Meyer\u00a0speculates about the activity at the site (he calls it a \u201cchild sex camp\u201d) and rejects the conclusions of authorities who have said otherwise (he says, \u201cthe experts from the government, they\u2019re full of s\u2014\u201d).In the days after the initial discovery, local media reported on the unfounded claims. A June 1 headline on Patch.com read, \u201cUnderground Tucson Bunker Possibly Used In Child Sex Trafficking.\u201dLocal station KGUN-TV labeled its segment \u201cUnderground Bunker Found,\u201d as part of the \u201cKGUN9 Child Trafficking Series.\u201d And News 4 Tucson (KVOA-TV) aired a segment \u2014 titled on YouTube \u201cHomeless camp or child trafficking den?\u201d \u2014 that was preceded by an anchor asking, \u201cIs it an abandoned homeless camp or is it something more sinister?\u201dThe latter report showed viewers a number of seemingly benign findings at the camp: a mirror, a table with shaving cream and flea shampoo, as well as an area \u201cwhere people probably slept.\u201d It then showed \u201cstraps\u201d on trees and a \u201cbunker\u201d with a small opening, and later mentioned children\u2019s items, such as toys and clothes.\u201cThis place is meant for child trafficking \u2014 it\u2019s meant for torturous, terrible things,\u201d a\u00a0volunteer with the veterans group said in that News 4 report.Dugan, however, said that\u00a0\u201cthe items that we found there are just not uncommon from what we see at other camps around the town and county.\u201d\u201cJust because they\u2019re homeless doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t use a mirror,\u201d he added.As for the straps\u00a0found on trees, Dugan said authorities \u201chave seen similar types of things\u201d at other homeless camps, and they are sometimes used to hang food out of the reach of animals.ICE, in a statement provided by a spokeswoman, said that \u201cspecial agents who specialize in human smuggling and human trafficking collaborated with the Tucson Police Department on the information collected from the scene.\u201d\u201cBased on the information provided by TPD,\u201d the agency said, it \u201cconcurred with the police department\u2019s findings that nothing at the site validates the claims of possible human trafficking or child sex trafficking.\u201dOne video about the conspiracy theory, posted on the Facebook page \u201cStranger Than Fiction News,\u201d received 41,000 shares. It referred to the matter as a \u201cmassive cover-up by city officials.\u201d\u201cPeople need to know we investigated it from the first report and continued to investigate it for days after,\u201d Dugan told us, adding that the department continues to encourage residents to report perceived suspicious activity.Attempts to connect the camp to the\u00a0Clintons echoed the debunked \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory, which posited that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was operating a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza shop. Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton lamented the most recent conspiracy, referring to it\u00a0on Twitter as \u201c#Pizzagate 2.0.\u201dEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations\u00a0working with Facebook\u00a0to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.Dugan, Pete.

Trump overstated public confidence in his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus and downplayed confidence in the Obama administration\u2019s response to H1N1.","fact_checkers":"Miriam Valverde","premise":"\"President Donald Trump went on Twitter to applaud his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus and shift attention to another pandemic that happened when Joe Biden was vice president. The first U.S. case of a new H1N1 influenza virus (also called swine flu) was detected in April 2009, three months after the Obama administration began. The pandemic took a toll on Americans, with an estimated 60.8 million H1N1 cases and 12,469 deaths from April 2009 to April 2010. Worldwide, it\u2019s estimated the virus killed between 151,700 to 575,400 people during its first year. (By August 2010, the World Health Organization said the virus had largely run its course.) Trump said Biden, a top Democratic presidential candidate, led an ineffective effort to combat the outbreak. \"\"Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!\"\" Trump tweeted March 12. Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest! Trump previously falsely claimed the Obama administration \"\"didn't do anything about\"\" swine flu. How does his recent tweet line up with the facts? He\u2019s wrong about Biden\u2019s role and omitted important context about his polling. \"\"Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people.\"\" Biden was the vice president, but he was not in charge of the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the H1N1 pandemic. That responsibility mainly fell on the leaders of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Trump enlisted Vice President Mike Pence to helm the country\u2019s response to COVID-19.) Health policy experts told PolitiFact they did not recall Biden having a prominent leadership role. PolitiFact also reviewed archives of Obama\u2019s public statements on H1N1 and found that Obama generally mentioned the leadership of department heads and of his homeland security adviser, not Biden. Biden\u2019s coronavirus response plan says he \"\"helped lead\"\" the Obama administration\u2019s response to H1N1 in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014. It does not offer further detail. The H1N1 response \"\"was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!\"\" Neither the White House nor Trump\u2019s campaign responded to our requests for information backing Trump\u2019s claim. If Trump was talking about public confidence in the federal government\u2019s ability to handle outbreaks, he might have been referring to a Gallup poll taken Feb. 3-16. But he isn\u2019t correct about its findings and ignores key context. A lot has happened since Gallup asked a random sample of 1,028 adults how confident they were that the federal government would be able to handle a coronavirus outbreak. Trump\u2019s \"\"78% approval rating\"\" could be alluding to the combined 77% who were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%). The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. Gallup in February said that the 77% figure showed a higher level of confidence than Gallup had found for previous health scares during other administrations. But confidence in the 2009 H1N1 response was the second highest, not \"\"one of the worst on record.\"\" The averages of two polls in 2009 showed that 67% of respondents were very confident or somewhat confident in the federal government\u2019s ability to handle the H1N1 outbreak. Those two polls were released in May and August of that year, about a month and four months into the outbreak. Public confidence in the federal government\u2019s handling of the Zika virus, Ebola virus, and bird flu were lower than for H1N1. Gallup\u2019s February poll began days after the Trump administration announced restrictions on travelers who had been in China in the prior two weeks, and at that time, no one had died within the United States from the disease caused by the new coronavirus. \"\"This high level of confidence may be related to the fact that all deaths from COVID-19 have occurred abroad, rather than on U.S. soil,\"\" Gallup said in February. By the time of Trump\u2019s March 12 tweet, there were more than 1,600 coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 41 deaths. Polling done after Gallup\u2019s shows a drop in confidence in the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. A Feb. 28-March 1 Morning Consult survey showed that 49% of voters approved of Trump\u2019s response to the outbreak, down from 56% in a Feb. 24-26 survey \u2014 a decline fueled by drops among independents and Democrats. The poll surveyed 1,997 registered voters and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points. Trump said, \"\"Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest! Biden was not in charge of the Obama administration\u2019s H1N1 response. A Gallup poll in February \u2014 before any coronavirus deaths in the United States \u2014 showed that 77% of respondents had confidence in the administration\u2019s handling of the outbreak. It ranked higher than averages of two 2009 polls on confidence in the Obama administration\u2019s handling of H1N1. Public confidence in H1N1 was the second highest, not \"\"one of the worst\"\" or the \"\"lowest.\"\" Polling done after the Gallup poll showed a decline in approval of Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak.

{"claim_id":"35590","hypothesis":"A 2007 study showed burning sage kills 94% of bacteria.","date_published":"July 17, 2020","explanation_1":"Evidence also suggests that the virus spreads when an individual touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose, though recently published guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) caution that \u201cthis is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\u201d It is not known how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist on surfaces and research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggests the virus may last at least several hours and up to three days on certain surfaces. Different surfaces and different conditions \u2013 such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and air movements \u2013 may see different results. Higher humidity, higher temperature, more airflow, and more sunlight or UV light are less-than-ideal conditions for SARS-CoV-2.","fact_checkers":"Madison Dapcevich","premise":"Since as early as October 2019, Snopes readers have inquired about headlines and social media posts that claim burning sage \u201ckills 94% of bacteria.\u201d In 2020, the question took on new significance for some readers as the United States grappled with a surge of reported cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. Though burning some plants has been scientifically shown to eliminate airborne bacterium, there is inconclusive evidence to suggest that burning sage \u2013 or \u201csmudging\u201d \u2013 is capable of purifying the air in confined spaces. The \u201c94%\u201d claim is based on a 2007 study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in which researchers analyzed the ability of \u201cmedicinal smoke\u201d to cleanse a room of certain airborne bacteria. Reports have since circulated the internet, incorrectly lumping sage into a long ingredient list that included dried roots and leaves tested as part of the experiment. \u201cThis is highly controversial since breathing in smoke has known harms, yet the antibacterial benefits are uncertain,\u201d Dean of Yale School of Public Health Dr. Sten Vermund told Snopes. Vermund added that there is no evidence that burning sage kills either bacteria or viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the severe respiratory disease COVID-19. As part of the 2007 study, researchers from the National Botanical Research Institute in India burned medicinal smoke from havan samagri within a confined space to determine whether certain herbs contained antimicrobial properties. Havan samagri is a \u201cmixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs\u201d that contains dozens of various types of wood, herbs, fruit and seeds used in Vedic Hindu tradition. However, sage was not included in the study\u2019s ingredient list. One hour of burning havan samagri was shown to kill more than 94% of airborne bacteria \u2013 and the effects were not short-lived. The evidence further suggested that medicinal smoke had the ability to \u201cpurify\u201d or \u201cdisinfect\u201d the air for up to 24 hours in a closed room. Even after a month, the researchers found that certain pathogenic bacteria were still absent from the room, such as those that cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Though it appears havan samagri may have some antimicrobial properties when burned, the findings do not suggest its use has any impact on viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This is, in part, due to the biological differences between bacteria and viruses. The Mayo Clinic notes that bacteria are capable of thriving in \u201cmany different types of environments\u201d whereas viruses require living hosts to multiply. The way that COVID-19 spreads and how long it is present in the air also plays a role. The virus is known to transmit via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and land in the mouth or nose of someone nearby.","sources":" ","label":2,"subjects":"Science, COVID-19","__index_level_0__":3916}

That\u2019s not the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions \"\"even on the due date\"\" of the child. Such an abortion would be\u00a0a purely hypothetical scenario; doctors said such a procedure doesn't make sense medically.\"","fact_checkers":"Linda Qiu","premise":"\"Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who\u2019s known for his strong anti-abortion views, said Hillary Clinton is the extremist when it comes abortion, not him. \"\"Why doesn\u2019t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child,\"\" he said during the Feb. 6 Republican debate in New Hampshire. Is it true that Clinton \"\"believes all abortions should be legal even on the due date\"\"? The Rubio campaign didn\u2019t get back to us. So we looked at comments Clinton made on the issue over the past 15 years. Clinton has said she could support restrictions on abortions in the third trimester (about week 28 of a pregnancy) if the mother\u2019s life and health are taken into account. Rubio casts this position as the equivalent of supporting abortions on the due date, but that exaggerates Clinton\u2019s position. Restricting late-term abortions Clinton responded to Rubio\u2019s attack the morning after the debate, calling it \"\"pretty pathetic.\"\" \"\"I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account,\"\" she said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \"\"And, you know, when he raises the very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons.\"\" We found many instances of Clinton saying abortion should be \"\"safe, legal and rare.\"\" In short, Clinton is open to restrictions on late-term abortions provided there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother. This includes both mental health\u00a0and medical complications like preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of high blood pressure that could lead to death. We should note that those who want a total abortion ban \u2014 a position that Rubio has expressed \u2014 see exceptions made for rape, incest and health as loopholes that undermine late-term restrictions. Advocating for exceptions could theoretically encompass a due-date abortion, but Rubio\u2019s conclusion that Clinton supports due-date abortions is not backed by evidence and logically unsound. Here\u2019s a sampling of comments Clinton's made in the past: Sept. 28, 2015,\u00a0Meet the Press Daily: \"\"There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.\"\" June 4, 2007,\u00a0Democratic presidential forum: \"\"What I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare. And, by rare, I mean rare.\"\" Oct. 8, 2000,\u00a0New York Senate debate: \"\"I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I\u2019ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it\u2019s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman\u2019s choice.\"\" When abortions can be performed According to the reproductive health nonprofit, the Guttmacher Institute, 20 states limit abortions after \"\"viability\"\" (which refers to the point when a fetus can survive out of the womb) and 23 states prohibit abortions between 20 and 28 weeks. Seven states and Washington D.C., have no time restrictions, but this doesn\u2019t mean late-term abortions are common. In fact, only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute. \"\"People say we should place legal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester. The reality is the medical community is doing that in practice,\"\" said Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco and an advisor at Ibis Reproductive Health. \"\"Third-trimester abortion is very uncommon.\"\" As for the scenario Rubio is suggesting \u2014 an abortion performed on the due date to save the life of the mother? It doesn\u2019t exist. \"\"Nobody would talk about abortion on the woman\u2019s due date. If the mother\u2019s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives,\"\" Grossman said. \"\"Medically, it does not compute.\"\" Our ruling Rubio said Clinton \"\"believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\"\" Clinton does not believe that all abortion should be legal. Instead, she\u2019s said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother\u2019s life and health are in danger.

Around 18,000 people died or were classified as missing after the so-called Triple Disaster, when a massive earthquake set off a tsunami - in some places 30 meters high - destroying a wide swathe of Japan\u2019s northeastern coast and triggering a nuclear meltdown at the plant. \u201cThe use of nuclear energy is at the limit (of safety) because we still have not managed to achieve total security,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIn my personal opinion, I would not use nuclear energy until there is total security. There is not enough security to guarantee that there will not be a disaster,\u201d Francis added. Francis said assertions that nuclear accidents were rare were insufficient because effects of radiation are felt for decades on people and the environment, such as in the area around the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine which was crippled by a meltdown in 1986. Francis, who wrote a major encyclical in 2015 on protection of the environment and the effects of global warming, said humanity had gone beyond the limit in violating nature. As examples, he listed the overuse of pesticides and dispensing growth hormones to animals destined for human consumption. \u201cThe (need for the) protection of the environment has gotten to the point where it is either now or never,\u201d he said. Without naming countries, Francis accused states of practicing \u2018armament hypocrisy\u2019, saying nations of Christian tradition \u201cspeak of peace but live off weapons. This is called hypocrisy\u201d. Francis said the United Nations does much good around the world but criticized the system that gives veto power to only a few nations in the Security Council. \u201cWithout meaning any offence to anyone, think of the (UN) Security Council: if here is a problem with weapons and everybody votes in favor of avoiding a bellicose action ... and one with veto power votes no, everything stops,\u201d he said. The Security Council has five permanent members with veto power - the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China. \u201cI have heard people say that the United Nations should move forward and give up the right of veto of some nations ... It would be beautiful if everyone had the same right,\u201d Francis said.","sources":"https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fpope-francis-shocks-world-endorsing-donald-trump%2F, http:\/\/wtoe5news.com\/about-us\/, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fpope-francis-shocks-world-endorsing-donald-trump%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/michelle-obama-plagiarized-2008-democratic-national-convention-speech\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fpope-francis-shocks-world-endorsing-donald-trump%2F, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/worldviews\/wp\/2016\/02\/17\/vatican-its-not-all-about-you-trump\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/politics\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/religious\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Pope+Francis+Shocks+World+By+Endorsing+Donald+Trump-Fiction%21&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fpope-francis-shocks-world-endorsing-donald-trump%2F&via=erumors, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fpope-francis-shocks-world-endorsing-donald-trump%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/secretary-without-honor-philip-jennings\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/truthorfiction\/, http:\/\/wtoe5news.com\/us-election\/pope-francis-shocks-world-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-releases-statement\/","label":2,"subjects":"Politics, Religious","__index_level_0__":7861}
{"claim_id":"9050","hypothesis":"Migraine surgery produces 'dramatic improvements' in functioning, study finds","date_published":"January 5, 2018","explanation_1":"Getty Images This news release discussed a study from the journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery which claims that migraine surgery can lead to \u201cdramatic improvements\u201d in patients\u2019 functionality and quality of life. Migraine surgery entails decompressing nerves around the face and head of migraine sufferers. The procedure is like a permanent version of Botox injections, which temporarily relax facial muscles and have proven to be effective in treating several (though not all) kinds of migraines. Though the news release was enthusiastic about the study\u2019s findings, it failed to mention several big limitations, including that the results were based off a self-reported pain questionnaire (self-reports are often ripe for bias). It also did not mention that the questionnaire is only able to determine self-efficacy and functionality in patients \u2014 not pain reduction or decrease in symptom severity. Finally, the news release did not compare the treatment to any other migraine-specific alternatives, nor did it address the possible harms of facial surgery. Migraines impact a huge number of people worldwide \u2014 it is estimated that about 13% of U.S. adults have had a migraine, and there are millions of patients who experience them chronically. But although so many people suffer from this ailment, very little about the mechanisms behind migraines is actually understood. Most migraine treatments, including many medications and Botox injections, were actually designed to treat other problems first, and are now used for migraines because they were shown to relieve symptoms even though many scientists can only guess as to why. The idea that a migraine-specific surgery could help solve the chronic migraines permanently would be exciting for many people. Unfortunately, the surgery remains controversial, and this release does not help to make it less so. Finally, a larger context would have been helpful here, especially some idea of how accepted this surgery is and how often patients benefit, based on what is known to date.","fact_checkers":"Leah Rosenbaum,Susan Molchan, MD, MA,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"The news release did not include the cost of this migraine surgery \u2014 nor did it really say what a migraine surgery entails, except for briefly comparing it to a cosmetic forehead-lift. According to the website linked in the news release, a cosmetic forehead-lift (also called a \u201cbrow lift) costs an average of $3,403. However, a look at anecdotal articles online reveals that the cost can often be much more if not covered by insurance \u2014 up to $30,000 in some cases. The description of benefits of this research is a bit cloudy, since it seemed to have two endpoints: first, the study attempted to quantify the extent of disability in migraine patients by using the\u00a0Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). Second, it looked to see if PSEQ numbers improved following migraine surgery. The release says that the study found that after the migraine surgery, patients improved an average of 112% over their baseline PSEQ score. However, as we have pointed out on numerous occasions, these types of statistics often don\u2019t tell us much. We don\u2019t know if this means that migraine patients\u2019 self-efficacy went from \u201cbad\u201d to \u201cgreat,\u201d or just from \u201cterrible\u201d to \u201cless terrible.\u201d Did this improvement mean that patients were able to go back to work, or that they were able to get out of bed? Without concrete numbers, it is hard to tell. This is perhaps one of the most egregious omissions of the news release: not mentioning any potential harms of a surgery that directly impacts the nerves and muscles of the face. While the method of this surgery is not included in the news release, a look at the Mass General web page where the lead author works describes the surgery as a \u201crelease\u201d of nerves in the eye, forehead, back of head, and nasal regions. Depending on the extent of the surgery, a patient may be required to undergo anesthesia in an operating room. The risks are not mentioned on this page either, but a look at the risks of the similar brow-lift procedure shows that complications may include facial nerve damage or paralysis, infection, and scarring. This news release scores poorly on the quality of evidence for several reasons. First, neither the news release nor the study itself described any limitations of the study (though it is safe to assume there are several, including the small sample size). Second, and most important, the study was based entirely on results from patients\u2019 self-reported questionnaires. Self-reported data is notoriously susceptible to bias\u2013patients may have different interpretations of the questions, may want to consciously or unconsciously please the researchers, or may be dishonest because they are embarrassed they don\u2019t meet what they think is the \u201cdesired\u201d outcome. That the news release did not mention this obvious limitation is a serious flaw. Finally, it is important to note that the Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) only measures the patients\u2019 feelings of self-efficacy and daily functioning, not whether or not the severity of their pain has actually improved. Someone could be feeling the same amount of pain after the surgery, but if they felt that they were functioning better in their daily life than their questionnaire score would increase. No disease mongering. The news release does not mention the funding sources, and that earns a Not Satisfactory rating here. The study does disclose that none of the researchers have conflicts of interest. This is another important criterion which the news release did not meet. And even though the published study did not address alternatives either, we still encourage news release writers to include this background for interested readers \u2014 both patients and journalists. Presumably, patients who turn to surgery have been resistant to the usual interventions and if so, this should be clarified in the news release. There are many alternatives to migraine treatment, from prophylactic daily medications to Botox injections. In fact, Botox injections operate on the same mechanism that the migraine surgery does: the botulinum toxin is injected into facial nerves to paralyze them and release pressure on the nerves surrounding the face. Botox injections for migraines have been well-studied and proven to be effective; the procedure was approved by the FDA in 2010. Unlike the surgery however, the Botox injections are not permanent \u2014 though they also appear to carry fewer side effects. It would make the most sense to compare the surgery to Botox injections, but neither the researchers nor the news release did this. Nor did they compare the migraine surgery to any other migraine treatments. Instead, they compared results from the patient questionnaire to patients that suffered other chronic pain ailments, such as lower back pain. They said that migraine patients reported greater improvement than lower back pain patients, but this tells us very little because the two conditions are so different. The news release made no mention of how or where patients could obtain migraine surgery. Online it seems that these surgeries are offered at many boutique plastic surgery centers around the country\u2013though interestingly it is only plastic surgeons who seem to offer this treatment, not neurologists (the doctors that most often treat migraine sufferers). The news release and the study also did not mention that not all migraine patients will be eligible for the procedure. Although we know little about migraines, it is known that they are triggered in different people through different mechanisms. A woman who has hormonal migraines, for example, might not benefit from nerve decompression. The news release did establish that this study was the first time that the\u00a0PSEQ was used to evaluate patients who underwent migraine surgery. The headline of the news release was taken from a quote from the lead author, who said that migraine surgery can lead to \u201cdramatic improvements\u201d in the daily functioning of migraine patients. Yet, as mentioned above, based on the quality of the evidence and benefits we have no idea just how big these improvements are. Is a patient that was formerly severely disabled now able to work and maintain a normal quality of life? All we know is that the patients improved in one self-reported measurement, but we don\u2019t know how much improvement should be considered \u201cdramatic.\u201d","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/GettyImages-643310504.jpg,http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/Fulltext\/2018\/01000\/Ability_to_Cope_with_Pain_Puts_Migraine_Surgery.35.aspx?PRID=PRS_PR_010218#R2-35,https:\/\/migraine.com\/migraine-statistics\/","label":2,"subjects":"migraine surgery,Wolters Kluwer Health","__index_level_0__":3124}
{"claim_id":"10468","hypothesis":"The dark side of eye surgery","date_published":"April 25, 2008","explanation_1":"\"This brief segment reports on an FDA advisory committee recommendation that patients should receive clearer warnings about the side effects of Lasik vision correction surgery. It sketches the scope of the problem and the risks. But the segment falls short of best practices in several important ways:  It fails to make clear that the Lasik procedure is elective and expensive\u2013and that the \"\"treatments\"\" of glasses and contacts are used by a large majority of people who need vision correction. It uses two diametrically opposed medical sources\u2013one a strong advocate of the procedure, one a strong detractor. The public would be better served by hearing from one or more dispassionate, knowledgeable sources who can thoughtfully compare risks vs. benefits, provide more detail about the side effects, etc. It fails to cite facts regarding what may be the most important measure of surgical success\/patient satisfaction: The ability to see well without glasses. It fails to include any patient takeaway: Given the advisory committee\u2019s recommendation, what should someone considering getting Lasik surgery know and do? The reference at the end to what doctors should do is, for patients, beside the point. A viewer of this story is likely to come away frightened of the surgery and uncertain about what to do. That is not a good outcome.\"","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"\"The segment fails to mention the price of Lasik surgery, which is considerable\u2013$4,000 and up. The omission is particularly unfortunate because the story is essentially about benefits vs. risks of a voluntary surgery. The report cites the estimate of a 95 percent patient satisfaction rate. The source for this is not given. The reason why many people get this procedure is to be able to stop wearing glasses. The story should have told viewers what proportion achieve that goal. The report focuses largely on the potential harms. But the segment fails to describe which of these side effects is permanent, and what proportion are disabling. That figure is far less than the 5 percent who report being unsatisfied with the results. Many of these are dissatisfied because their vision is short of 20\/20 or because they still need to wear glasses. This is a key omission which results in an exaggerated sense of visual disability. The segment is based on an FDA advisory committee\u2019s recommendation that patients should receive better warnings about Lasik. While the action itself is not evidence, the committee\u2019s recommendation is based on an assessment of evidence. The report cites \"\"studies\"\" that show a 95 percent patient satisfaction rating. This is not enough detail to help a viewer determine the quality of this evidence. There is also no source provided for that figure, or any sense for how it was derived. The story states: \"\"the FDA has received only 140 complaints from 1998 to 2006. But even if only 5 percent of patients are dissatisfied, with 700,000 Americans getting Lasik every year, it could mean thousands of unhappy patients. \"\" Wait a minute:\u00a0 140 out of 700,000 is not 5 percent!!! The piece does not exaggerate the risks of surgery. At the same time it is not clear where the \"\"5%\"\" complication rate comes from. Certainly NOT from the number of complaints that the FDA has reported which is well under the 5% level. The report would be stronger if this information was included. The segment quotes one doctor who is an advocate of the procedure and one who is absolutely opposed. But the public would be better served by hearing from one or more dispassionate, knowledgeable sources who can thoughtfully compare risks vs. benefits, provide more detail about the side effects, etc. The story fails to emphasize that this surgery is elective, and that contact lenses and glasses correct vision with virtually no risk of side effects. The segment makes clear that Lasik eye surgery is widely available. It\u2019s clear from the story that this procedure has been around for years and is in widespread use. Because two different physician sources were quoted \u2013 one advocating the procedure and one opposing \u2013 we assume it did not rely on a news release.\"","sources":" ","label":2,"subjects":" ","__index_level_0__":5753}
{"claim_id":"28700","hypothesis":"President Trump has the right and the means to send unblockable text mesage to all American cellular phones.","date_published":"December 1, 2016","explanation_1":"What's true: A Federal Communications Commission system enables the sending of unblockable emergency alerts to cellular phones. What's false: No information suggests that President Trump has plans to frivolously mass-text the United States.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 30 November 2016,\u00a0New York Magazine\u00a0published the first of several articles\u00a0reporting that as of 20 January 2017, President Donald Trump would acquire the ability to send \u201cunblockable\u201d text messages to all American citizens: You\u2019ve probably, at some point, gotten a text alert on your phone about some nasty weather, an Amber Alert about a missing child, or even a (very poorly worded) alert about police looking for a criminal. These 90-character messages, known as Wireless Emergency Alerts (or WEAs), are part of a program put in place after Congress passed the Warning, Alert, and Response Network (WARN) Act, in 2006. WEAs allow for targeted messages to be sent to every cell phone getting a signal from certain geographically relevant cell towers (or, in a national emergency, all of them). Here\u2019s where things get interesting. Per the FCC, a WEA may be sent for three different reasons: What alerts does WEA deliver? Alerts from WEA cover only critical emergency situations. Consumers will receive only three types of alerts: 1. Alerts issued by the President \u2026 The article\u2019s author went on to underscore the highly speculative nature of the claim: All WEAs must be issued through FEMA\u2019s Integrated Public Alert & Warning System, meaning that an emergency alert from the president still has at least one layer to pass through before being issued. While FEMA is under control of the executive branch (the head of FEMA is selected by the president, and reports to the Department of Homeland Security), the agency would have a vested interest in not seeing their alert system bent toward, uh, non-emergency ends. Although the initial version of the story made it clear that the claims were highly speculative and based on a possibility (not an actual vested power handed over to Trump on Inauguration Day), CNet published an article that did not include that particular context: President-elect Donald Trump will have access to a system that can send unblockable texts to every phone in the US once he takes the oath of office. Wireless Emergency Alerts are a program created by a 2006 act of Congress. The so-called \u201cWEAs\u201d can be targeted messages sent to all mobile phones in a particular area, like Amber alerts, or to all phones nationally, like an alert issued by the president, according to a report by New York Magazine\u2019s Select\/All blog. Although media speculation held that Trump could (and implicitly would) use the WEA frivolously to annoy Americans with insults in the middle of the night, the Federal Communications Commission explicitly states the system is for use in emergencies only: WEA is a public safety system that allows customers who own certain wireless phones and other enabled mobile devices to receive geographically-targeted, text-like messages alerting them of imminent threats to safety in their area. The technology ensures that emergency alerts will not get stuck in highly congested areas, which can happen with standard mobile voice and texting services. WEA (formerly known as the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) or Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN)) was established pursuant to the Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act. WEA enables government officials to target emergency alerts to specific geographic areas \u2013 lower Manhattan, for example \u2013 through cell towers that broadcast the emergency alerts for reception by WEA-enabled mobile devices \u2026 Pre-authorized national, state or local government authorities may send alerts regarding public safety emergencies, such as evacuation orders or shelter\u2013in-place orders due to severe weather, a terrorist threat or chemical spill, to WEA. The portion used to tie Trump to the claim specified that the only unblockable texts are emergency alerts directly from the President: Alerts from WEA cover only critical emergency situations. Consumers will receive only three types of alerts: 1. Alerts issued by the President 2. Alerts involving imminent threats to safety or life 3. Amber Alerts Participating carriers may allow subscribers to block all but Presidential alerts. The FCC announced that FEMA would be conducting a test of the system at 11:18 AM PDT (2:18 PM EDT) on Wednesday, 3 October 2018, although the test might take a few minutes to make it to all cellphones: \ud83d\udcf3 TODAY (10\/3): At 2:18 PM EDT, we will be testing the Wireless Emergency Alert system nationwide.

The posts linked to articles on \u201cnatural health\u201d web sites touting British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s criticism of McDonald\u2019s use of \u201csubstandard\u201d beef treated with the antimicrobial agent ammonium hydroxide (a process which has also been applied to poultry):\u00a0 Chef Jamie Oliver Proves McDonald\u2019s Burgers \u201cUnfit for Human Consumption\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/aEpqrkJZg4 \u2014 Rob (@djroblee) January 19, 2018  An article on the web site The Essence of Life reported: Healthy food supporter Jamie Oliver took on the biggest fast food joint in the world, and he won. He managed to get the multi national corporation to admit that their burger meat was sub-standard and have vowed to change it. Oliver highlighted how McDonald\u2019s used ammonium hydroxide to \u2018wash\u2019 their beef before it was made into hamburgers, in order to make it fit for human consumption, without this stage the food would not have been legal to sell by nationwide standards. Meat that has not been treated in this way is usually used for dog and cat food. The ammonium hydroxide is used as an anti-microbial agent which basically acts as a catalyst to turn \u2018inedible\u2019 meat into burgers. Oliver said: \u201cBasically, we\u2019re taking a product that would be sold in the cheapest way for dogs, and after this process, is being given to human beings.\u201d These claims are partially true. However, what none of the recent articles (including the one above) makes clear is that Oliver\u2019s media campaign against the use of ammoniated beef took place in 2011, and McDonald\u2019s and other large restaurant chains (including Taco Bell and Burger King)\u00a0stopped using the product later that same year. A 2013\u00a0statement on McDonald\u2019s global corporate web site reads: McDonald\u2019s does not use lean beef trimmings treated with ammonia, what some individuals call \u201cpink slime,\u201d in our burgers, and hasn\u2019t since 2011. Any recent reports that we do are false. Burgers are at the heart of the Golden Arches, and the fact is, McDonald\u2019s USA serves only 100% USDA-inspected beef\u00a0\u2014 no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders\u00a0\u2014 period. Prior to 2011, to assist with supply, McDonald\u2019s USA, like many other food retailers, used this safe product but it is no longer part of our supply. The public controversy over the widespread use of ammoniated beef\u00a0(which McDonald\u2019s describes as \u201csafe,\u201d as you may have noted above) actually took off in 2009, when the New York Times\u00a0ran an article questioning the safety of the product. At that time it could be found in \u201ca majority of the hamburger sold nationwide,\u201d the Times reported, including that used in school lunch programs. Despite being deemed safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and effective at curbing bacterial growth by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), evidence had come to light that E. coli and salmonella contamination was found at some of the plants that produced the ammoniated lean beef trimmings. The USDA promised closer oversight. Jamie Oliver, who is known as a healthy eating crusader as well as a popular celebrity chef, jumped into the controversy by lambasting the use of ammonia-processed beef in an April 2011 episode of his television show Jamie Oliver\u2019s Food Revolution. Oliver dramatized his point by dousing an armful of beef byproducts with liquid ammonia and running it through a meat grinder, saying, \u201cSo, basically, we\u2019re taking a product that would be sold in the cheapest form for dogs, and after this process we can give it to humans.\u201d","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Food, fast food, jamie oliver, mcdonald's","__index_level_0__":5508}

The majority of participants in the protest were intended to simply take harmless vitamin pills. Activists in South Korea put out a call in August 2018 for 125 women to join them for a protest at Boshingak (a large pavilion at the center of Seoul) to demand the end of Clause 269, a portion of the South Korean legal code that criminalizes abortion, and to legalize the abortion drug Mifepristone. The protest, which was organized by the Korean feminist organizations Femidangdang and Baumealame in collaboration with Women on Waves, featured 125 women because that\u2019s the number of women, according to the activists, who have  abortions in South Korea every hour: Terminating a pregnancy is not a sin. It is not taboo. Right here in South Korea, where abortion is prohibited by law, we speak for women choosing to terminate pregnancies. Abortion is a right that must be secured no matter the social status of the woman. Society speaks of abortion as a decision that only promiscuous or unmarried women choose. Pregnancy is considered a just punishment that such women must bear. However, abortion is an operation that is most frequently enacted worldwide, and many women choose abortion for various reasons. According to the Korean Association of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, it is estimated that around 3000 surgical abortions are conducted within our country every day. This is three times the amount our government estimates. During the single hour that our performance is taking place, 125 South Korean women decide to terminate their pregnancy. Right at this moment, we speak of the women that choose abortion. 125 of us have come together to make the following demands to a country that imposes the responsibility of unwanted pregnancies upon women, and women only. The invitation for the event informed participants that while one activist would truly be taking the abortion drug Mifepristone, all 125 volunteers would be given harmless vitamins to take instead:  What do you do? 125 women gather in front of the hospital and eat medicine together. The organizer activist eats a drug called mifepristone, a drug that stops pregnancy. The rest of the participants eat vitamin pills. 125\uba85\uc758 \uc5ec\uc131\uc774 \ubcf4\uc2e0\uac01 \uc55e\uc5d0 \ubaa8\uc5ec \ub2e4\ud568\uaed8 \uc57d\uc744 \uba39\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc8fc\ucd5c \uce21 \ud65c\ub3d9\uac00\ub294 \uc784\uc2e0\uc911\ub2e8 \uc57d\ubb3c, \u2018\ubbf8\ud504\uc9c4(\ubbf8\ud398\ud504\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud1a4)\u2019 \uc54c\uc57d\uc744 \uba39\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 \ucc38\uac00\uc790\ub294 \ube44\ud0c0\ubbfc \uc54c\uc57d\uc744 \uba39\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. A message posted to Twitter announcing the event also stated that all of the pills handed out by the event organizers would be vitamins, not actual abortion pills:  We went through the sign-up process to find out more about the demonstration and noted that the sponsoring organization had stated on numerous occasions that the pills handed out to the 125 women participants would be nothing more than vitamins. In the event\u2019s FAQ section, for instance, the activists wrote that \u201call the pills distributed by the organizer to the participants are vitamin D.\u201d This event reportedly did feature at least one activist taking the drug Mifepristone. However, it\u2019s unclear if she or any other activists who might have actually taken the drug were pregnant at the time of the protest. A portion of the FAQ section explained that while the protest trod the line of legality, authorities would not be able to tell who had taken the drug or whether any of protest participants were pregnant: Is this performance illegal?

But it doesn\u2019t go far enough. The report correctly describes the actions of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). It adequately cites dissension among panel members about the value of immunizing smokers under 40. It usefully reports the general limitations on the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. But it ignores the core question the panel\u2019s recommendation raises:\u00a0  How effective will the recommendation be in preventing serious or fatal pneumococcal disease in the targeted population? How much money will be spent to save a life? That consideration is often the driver of a public health recommendation. Certainly it\u2019s been considered by the panel members. But it\u2019s not raised here. The story also reports statistics linking flu to pneumonia to death\u2013without indicating that such links are very unlikely to apply to the targeted population.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"\"The story reports per-dose price: $30 per dose for the most common form of the vaccine. It might have been useful to do the math: If 50 percent of adult smokers got the recommended vaccine, it would cost about half a billion dollars annually. The report leaves the most fundamental questions unanswered: How vulnerable is the targeted population\u2013adult smokers under 65 who have not been diagnosed with asthma or other chronic respiratory diseases\u2013to pneumococcal disease, and especially to potentially deadly forms? And how good is the evidence that the current vaccine can reduce incidence? This is a situation where the reporter should have sought the \"\"number needed to treat\"\" data: How many adult smokers would have to be vaccinated in order to prevent serious cases of the disease or death? Further, the report cites the often-published statistic that pneumonia is linked to many of the 36,000. But this link exists almost exclusively in an elderly and immunocompromised population\u2013not among otherwise healthy smokers under 65. The report should have explicitly called out the minor risks of vaccination, and of the uNPRoven safety for women who are pregnant or who may become pregant. Mentioning such risks is always important when dealing with a recommendation for a large population. Given the fact that the report is about an advisory panel recommendation\u2013not publication of new research\u2013the reporter is not required to discuss the evidence underlying the statement. But see the note below under \"\"Quantification of Benefits of Treatment.\"\" This exposes a serious flaw in failing to explore the underlying evidence. The story for the most part avoids exaggerating the risk of pneumococcal disease and the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing it. Yet the story cites the often reported annual statistics linking flu, pneumonia and death. These statistics apply mostly to an elderly and immunocompromised population. The vaccine is already recommended for this population. The use of this statistic without questioning its applicability to the population in question falsely supports the case for the recommendation. The story quotes a CDC epidemiologist and a physician representing a college health group who is skeptical of the recommendation. That\u2019s borderline sufficient for discussion of a new population-wide vaccine recommendation. We wish AP had sought commentary from an independent specialist in smoking-related disease and\/or in pneumonia and other pneumococcal diseases. As a matter of course, the story should have mentioned other ways adult smokers can reduce the risk of pneumococcal disease, especially in younger smokers where the wisdom of vaccination is questioned by some panel members. The story implies correctly that pneumococcal vaccine is widely available. The story correctly parses the facts that this is the first vaccine recommendation aimed at smokers, yet the treatment is currently in wide use. The CDC has not issued a press release about the advisory committee\u2019s recommendation.\"","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":" ","__index_level_0__":1317}

What's false: That loss of benefits would not be arbitrary, and the criteria and standards used to determine a recipient's eligibility for disability benefits would not change. Rather, the frequency of eligibility reviews would increase, thus discovering ineligibility sooner and more frequently.\"","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits. On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands. '\u201d That story reported: \u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows: In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:  The administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. So the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner. A considerable measure of truth, therefore, exists in the reports published by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Common Dreams.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":2501}
{"claim_id":"10540","hypothesis":"Doctors suggest that women hit pause button on osteoporosis drugs","date_published":"November 8, 2010","explanation_1":"This story about drug treatments for osteoporosis positions itself as a\u00a0careful re-analysis of the benefits and harms of\u00a0a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates. So we were surprised to find that\u00a0this story suffers from\u00a0some\u00a0of the same deficiencies that\u00a0typically plague boosterish puff pieces. Particularly problematic in this story\u00a0is the lack of quantitative data. We learn that the use of\u00a0bisphosphonate\u00a0drugs is becoming more limited due to increasing awareness of frightening side effects, such as cancer and\u00a0jaw necrosis. Yet there is no accounting in the story of how often\u00a0these harms occur\u00a0or how effective the drugs are for preventing fractures. There\u00a0also were significant gaps in the coverage\u00a0of costs and in the disclosure of potential financial conflicts. Despite its\u00a0considerable\u00a0shortcomings, the story gets credit for framing the issue in an appropriately cautious way and for soliciting a variety of expert perspectives. Readers should come away from the story with\u00a0a generally accurate, if\u00a0incomplete, understanding of the issue. There is evidence that long-term use of bisphosphonates can increase the risk for a number of rare but potentially serious adverse effects. How long women should continue taking these drugs is an open question that researchers urgently need to address.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"There was no discussion of costs, and we think there always should be. The story suggests that there are women who will clearly benefit from taking bisphosphonates and for whom these benefits will outweigh the harms. However, the story never provides any detailed accounting of how often these benefits occur. We are assured by one of the experts that a two- to five-year course of these drugs \u201csaves fractures, pain, disability and life.\u201d\u00a0But surely this is the same thing doctors were saying\u00a0until recently to the women who it turned out didn\u2019t need these drugs and weren\u2019t experiencing these benefits. To be credible, statements such as this need to be backed up with data\u00a0on the absolute reduction in fractures seen in the treatment group compared with placebo. It would\u00a0also\u00a0be important to note whether the fractures\u00a0prevented are in the\u00a0long bones or the hip (which\u00a0can be devastating for older\u00a0women)\u00a0or in the vertebrae (which are\u00a0often\u00a0asymptomatic and may not\u00a0affect how a patient\u00a0 lives her life). When the harms of a particular treatment are not\u00a0critical to discuss at length,\u00a0we sometimes\u00a0let a story slide without going into too much detail on this issue. In this case, however, the story\u2019s premise is that the harms of bisphosphonates\u00a0are larger than was previously appreciated and may outweigh the benefits for many women. So we expected the story to provide some statistics about how often these serious adverse effects\u00a0occur. The story fell short by using vague and subjective language to characterize these risks. Examples: We think readers will come away from this story with a generally\u00a0accurate, if\u00a0incomplete, understanding\u00a0of the role of bisphosphonates in osteoporosis treatment. So while there\u00a0clearly were some\u00a0critical deficiencies in this story\u2019s handling of the evidence (which we flag in other sections of this review), we\u2019ll award a\u00a0satisfactory here\u00a0to recognize the story\u2019s appropriately skeptical approach to the topic overall. Its\u00a0framing of the issue emphasized that the benefits of bisphosphonates are unlikely to outweigh the harms for many women at low to moderate risk of a fracture. And it acknowledged that there was little evidence to suggest that a \u201cpause\u201d in treatment, as advocated by some, would help prevent the serious problems that have been reported with long-term bisphosphonate use. The story also put appropriate emphasis on the role of pharmaceutical marketing in creating a demand for treatment among women who probably won\u2019t benefit from it. The story acknowledges that many women with modest bone loss\u00a0are being treated with bisphosphonates and other\u00a0osteoporosis drugs even though the\u00a0benefits of these treatments may not outweigh the risks. The story also notes that\u00a0the drug industry played a huge role in expanding the market for these drugs to women who probably don\u2019t need them (a\u00a0tale nicely chronicled in this 2009 piece by NPR). So it was odd, given this context, that the story let\u00a0an aggressive\u00a0claim by one\u00a0of its sources go completely unchallenged at the end of the piece. The source\u00a0says\u00a0that\u00a0\u00a0under-use of osteoporosis drugs\u00a0\u201cremains a bigger problem than overuse.\u201d\u00a0This is despite the source\u2019s previous acknowledgment that\u00a0most women with modest bone loss \u2014 a group that includes millions of women in the U.S., many of whom are being treated with bisphosphonates \u2014 probably do not\u00a0need to be treated and yet are being unnecessarily exposed to the risks and costs of treatment. We think this statement smacks of disease-mongering. The story calls on multiple experts who provide important and valuable context for the story. We just wish the story had pointed out the potential financial conflicts that one of the quoted researchers \u2014 Dr. Richard Eastell \u2014 may have when commenting on osteoporosis treatments. Eastell disclosed more than a dozen commercial relationships in this recent NEJM study, many of them with companies that make drugs to treat osteoporosis. The story mentions several other classes of drugs that may be used to treat osteoporosis in lieu of bisphosphonates. The story could have done a bit more to point out that these drugs also have known drawbacks that limit their use, but we don\u2019t think a full discussion was necessary to fulfill the criterion. The story makes it clear that the osteoporosis drugs being discussed have, in most cases,\u00a0been widely available for\u00a0a number of\u00a0years. The novelty of these drugs is not really in question, so we\u2019ll call this one not applicable. This story was clearly not based on a news release.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Los Angeles Times,Osteoporosis,women's health","__index_level_0__":3132}

According to these legal contracts, you still own your DNA, but so does Ancestry.com. The family history website Ancestry.com is selling a new DNA testing service called AncestryDNA. But the DNA and genetic data that Ancestry.com collects may be used against \u201cyou or a genetic relative.\u201d According to its privacy policies, Ancestry.com takes ownership of your DNA forever. Your ownership of your DNA, on the other hand, is limited in years. The article has caused widespread\u00a0concern\u00a0and prompted a public response from Ancestry.com\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer Eric Heath, who called Winston\u2019s post \u201cinflammatory and inaccurate\u201d. In response to our questions, Heath emphasized that Ancestry.com does not take ownership of your DNA; rather, you license it to them: \u2026The consumer maintains ownership of their data. This is actually why we need a license in order to conduct our analysis, display their results, and so on. Not only do they own their own data, but we allow them to download their raw data and they can ask us to destroy the data any time. Several documents control customers\u2019 agreements with Ancestry.com: the terms and conditions, an informed consent agreement, and the privacy policy. Before signing up for the DNA test, Heath says, you can also opt out of allowing your DNA data to be used for research, whether academic or commercial, when signing the informed consent agreement: Aside from the right to use their data to provide our services, we always ask for separate approval to use data in any other way. For example, when you activate a kit, there is a screen that pops up as part of our Informed Consent process that asks if you want to take part in anonymous third party research projects. You can say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d and your choice has no impact on the basic services we provide. Heath added that you can revoke any license you give Ancestry.com to use and distribute your DNA by deleting the data or closing your Ancestry.com account: We also allow consumers to change their Informed Consent decisions at any time. So, you could agree to take part in third party research when you first sign up, but then later decide you don\u2019t want to and we\u2019ll respect your change of mind. Obviously, if research has been conducted that included your anonymized data, we can\u2019t delete it after the fact. However, Winston objects to this distinction: A license is a contractual form of ownership. At its most basic, a license is defined as \u201ca permit from an authority to own or use something.\u201d Ancestry.com does not have \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d because customers still retain ownership of their own DNA. Ancestry.com does not have \u201cabsolute ownership\u201d because customers can revoke the license. But, Ancestry.com irrefutably takes ownership of customers\u2019 genetic data by contractual license granted in the Terms and Conditions. Omri Ben-Shahar, a University of Chicago law professor and an expert in contracts and consumer protection pointed to the same opt-outs that Heath did, saying:  A lot of the things [Winston] says happen don\u2019t have to happen \u2014\u00a0you have a choice over them. Even if a customer left every opt-out unclicked, and gave Ancestry.com full permission to do anything they were legally entitled to do with your data, Ben-Shahar says that it still be licensed, not owned, and you can still legally\u00a0retract it at any time. In his blog post, Winston also pointed out that customers can revoke their consent at any time. However, he directed us towards a section of the AncestryDNA\u00a0informed consent\u00a0agreement that addresses the potential risks of signing up for the DNA test: There is a potential risk that data about you could become public as the result of a security breach\u2026There is a potential risk that third parties could identify you from research that is made publicly available, for example if published in a scientific journal\u2026When DNA samples are physically transferred from us to collaborators, there is a potential risk that the samples could be lost or taken while in transit or storage. We take precautions to reduce the likelihood that this will happen and DNA samples are not transferred with your name or contact information. As Ancestry.com explains in the informed consent agreement, the fact that they remove identifying information from your DNA data before they add it to their database does not remove\u00a0this risk: Although we remove common identifying information (such as your name and contact information) from any data before publication, genetic data is different from other data because it can be used as an identifier in combination with other information. It is not currently common to do this but it can be done, particularly if genetic data about you or genetic relatives is available from other public genetic databases. Jeff Sovern, a law professor at St John\u2019s University in New York City\u00a0and an expert in consumer law, told us the circumstances under\u00a0which Ancestry.com might share your DNA data with others could be wider than they first appear. One significant section of the Terms and Conditions read as follows (until it was changed in light of the May 2017 controversy):\u00a0 By submitting DNA to AncestryDNA, you grant AncestryDNA and the Ancestry Group Companies a perpetual, royalty-free, world-wide, transferable license to use your DNA, and any DNA you submit for any person from whom you obtained legal authorization as described in this Agreement, and to use, host, sublicense and distribute the resulting analysis to the extent and in the form or context we deem appropriate on or through any media or medium and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered. The company no longer describes the license as \u201cperpetual\u201d, and the phrase \u201cto the extent and in the form or context we deem appropriate\u201d has been removed: By submitting DNA to AncestryDNA, you grant AncestryDNA and the Ancestry Group Companies a royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable license to host, transfer, process, analyze, distribute, and communicate your Genetic Information for the purposes of providing you products and services, conducting Ancestry\u2019s research and product development, enhancing Ancestry\u2019s user experience, and making and offering personalized products and services. In other words: we use your Genetic Information to provide products and services to you and improve our products and services for all our users. In addition, you understand that by providing any DNA to us, you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products that may be developed by AncestryDNA using your Genetic Information. Jeff Sovern said that the privacy statement\u2019s use of examples, rather than an exhaustive\u00a0list of scenarios in which user\u2019s information can be shared, makes him \u201cnervous\u201d:  That means the list is not complete, and there could be circumstances in which Ancestry could disclose the data that are not included in the list. Here\u2019s an analogy: if someone says \u201cexamples of things I do when I go out are to see a movie or a show,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean the person doesn\u2019t also go out to get drunk. Signing up for Ancestry.com\u2019s DNA test does not mean that the company owns your DNA data, in the complete and permanent way in which that word is typically understood. Customers license it to the company. Customers can choose not to allow their genetic information to be used for certain purposes, and can also revoke the license and have the DNA data and sample destroyed\u00a0if they wish \u2014 something that would not be possible if Ancestry.com owned them outright. However, granting Ancestry.com that license can involve giving them relatively significant rights over DNA data, and the scope of these rights may go beyond what is immediately apparent. Furthermore, licensing your DNA data to Ancestry.com does come with risks to your privacy, as well as potentially resulting in problems obtaining life insurance or, in certain circumstances, even getting hired for a particular job.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Legal Affairs, ancestry.com, dna, dna testing","__index_level_0__":994}

In many cases, normal wear and tear means N95 respirators cannot be sanitized and reused without putting health workers at risk.","fact_checkers":"Shefali Luthra","premise":"\"As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, front-line health care workers are decrying unsafe working conditions \u2014 in particular, describing inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or PPE. Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available. But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. \"\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"\"may be effective\"\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"\"when there are insufficient supplies.\"\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"\"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\" The reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"\"Decontamination is a complicated process,\"\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"\"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,\"\" she said. N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration. Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle\u2019s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit. \"\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\"\" Kenney said. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\"\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. In describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators, Trump said the United States is using \"\"some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask.\"\" That, he argued, \"\"is like ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" It is true that technology exists to sterilize N95s up to 20 times. But there are knowledge gaps and other shortcomings that limit how effective this process is. Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as \"\"ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that undermine the president\u2019s point.\"","sources":"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d6f6793c5352acec043\/1587699055513\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_UV-C_Fact_Sheet_V2.0_FINAL.pdf, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d8146c37a5e245b2020\/1587699073860\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_HydrogenPeroxide_Technical_Report_v2.0_final.pdf, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/136529\/download, https:\/\/khn.org\/news\/widely-used-surgical-masks-are-putting-health-care-workers-at-serious-risk\/, https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/30\/823803831\/technology-to-clean-and-reuse-ppe-is-being-deployed-to-hotspot-hospitals, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d86ad96f7626cdd1472\/1587699079169\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_HydrogenPeroxide_factsheet_v2.0_final.pdf, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/11\/business\/coronavirus-n95-mask-decontaminating-reuse.html, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d7d0793ed73ac17c4ca\/1587699069547\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_Heat_factsheet_v2.0_final.pdf, https:\/\/www.battelle.org\/docs\/default-source\/commercial-offerings\/industry-solutions\/729_battelle-ccds-final.pdf?sfvrsn=62cbf7c4_2, https:\/\/khn.org\/news\/osha-probing-health-worker-deaths-but-urges-inspectors-to-spare-the-penalties\/","label":3,"subjects":"Health Check, Coronavirus, Donald Trump, ","__index_level_0__":5561}
{"claim_id":"9538","hypothesis":"New statin guidelines: Everyone 40 and older should be considered for the drug therapy","date_published":"November 17, 2016","explanation_1":"Despite an alarmist headline, this report of the USPSTF\u2019s recommendations on statin therapy is relatively thorough, with some notable exceptions. The strength of the evidence underlying the recommendations is not discussed and the actual amount of potential benefit from statin therapy is not mentioned, nor is the potential for harm adequately elaborated upon. Perhaps what is most missing from this \u201cjust-the-facts ma\u2019am\u201d article on the USPSTF\u2019s recommendations is the larger sense of context: major statin trials have all been funded by statin manufacturers where we know that adverse event information is incomplete and sometimes hidden, benefits are typically exaggerated as they are expressed in relative risk reductions, and that most people, physicians and patients included, will likely overestimate the benefit they might derive from statin therapy. Above all, the medicalizing of cholesterol levels in otherwise healthy people is considered by some to be\u00a0among the biggest current scandals in medicine. Having said that, it was good to see this article tipping\u00a0the hat toward those who have put forward very strong arguments against the measuring and altering of our blood cholesterols, mentioning the questionable chance of benefit and the many potential harms. It also was good to see that the article noted that there were at least two sides to this issue and that \u201cIndividual\u00a0doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\u201d \u00a0 Because this recommendation affects millions of Americans, how well it is understood, especially around the potential magnitude of benefit and potential for harm from long-term statin treatment, has huge implications for the health of the population. This recommendation is a great invitation\u00a0for health journalists, if they haven\u2019t already done so, to dig deeper and to introduce themselves to the many controversies over statins.","fact_checkers":"Alan Cassels,Richard Hoffman, MD,Joy Victory","premise":"Costs of the drugs are not included. Recently, total costs for statin therapy in the U.S. were estimated at approximately $17 billion. It would also be useful to know that there is a wide variety in prices over the many statins currently on the market. We don\u2019t know to what extent people in this category of risk (more than 10% or more than 7.5%) would benefit from statins, which would seem an essential and basic element of the story. Any recommendation that has the potential to alter the drug-taking habits of a huge swath of the population must be explained in numerical terms and so this was an unfilled gap. It mentions\u00a0\u201cmuscle pain and\u00a0cataracts [and] an increased risk for diabetes in women.\u201d This is sufficient, but the story would have been stronger if it had discussed frequency of these side effects, and mentioned the more serious (and thankfully more rare) risks of rhabdomyolysis and muscle breakdown. The quality of the evidence is not explained, even though typically the level of evidence behind a USPSTF review is high, and the USPSTF goes to the trouble of quantifying its evidence. (ie: grade A, B or C, etc). This is a tough call, but the most widely-read part of the story\u2013the headline\u2013does cross the line by suggesting everyone over 40\u00a0with some level of cardiovascular risk (which means MOST of us) should consider taking a statin. Some have written extensively of the problems of creating diseases out of risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or low bone density, and have fairly criticized the widespread dissemination of this type of population-wide, drug-industry funded disease mongering. The story includes independent sources and we didn\u2019t see any apparent conflicts of interest. There are many alternatives (cholesterol-altering agents, lifestyle factors and so on) that were worthy of mention. It\u2019s pretty clear and obvious that statins are available via\u00a0a doctor\u2019s prescription. The story establishes novelty of the task force report by explaining: The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of\u00a0whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease. The presence of outside critique of these recommendations suggest there was a low reliance on the news release.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"statins","__index_level_0__":3584}
{"claim_id":"9198","hypothesis":"Breath test could help detect stomach and esophageal cancers","date_published":"February 3, 2017","explanation_1":"This news release about a breath test to detect stomach and esophageal cancers discusses the potential benefits of a screening test that could distinguish useful indications of early-stage, but serious, cancer in the breaths of average people \u2013.if future research shows it can work in the real world. But that\u2019s a bit off track from what the researchers tested. The underlying trial merely showed that in most cases breath analysis could distinguish between people who were already known to have stomach or esophageal cancer (advanced in most cases) with people who did not have any signs of cancer. The release did note at the end that researchers have yet to study whether this breath analysis can detect cancers among people in the general population. That\u2019s an important point and one that would have been good to emphasize earlier in the release. The release gave only the briefest nod to the existence of numerous other breath tests for cancer that are being studied and didn\u2019t explain how this particular research compares to other efforts. While this research is a necessary step, there is scant support for the claims in the release that this screening test \u201ccould detect cancer\u201d in apparently healthy people and the suggestion that the test could mean \u201cearlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.\u201d Those claims dominated news coverage of the research announcement, as seen here, here and here. Detecting early cancer and then showing that early detection lowers stomach cancer mortality has not been demonstrated. HealthNewsReview.org also reviewed a HealthDay story on the breath test study findings.","fact_checkers":"Andrew Holtz, MPH,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"This research is only at its earliest stages, so is it too early to expect cost information? If it\u2019s not too early to promote a technique in a news release it\u2019s not too early to provide a ballpark cost. The release does tout potential savings from avoiding \u201cunnecessary\u201d endoscopies but without also considering that an easy test could send many healthy into further testing or even treatment they didn\u2019t need. A 20% false positive rate, which this test apparently offers, could translate into a huge number of expensive endoscopies. The release claims benefits, including early detection, avoidance of unnecessary endoscopies and more successful treatment that were not actually looked at in the underlying study. In essence, the release speculated about an ideal, proven breath test, while the research report merely indicated that the results of a preliminary trial suggest that the concept would be worth trying in conditions that more closely resemble the real world. The release should have noted that even if such a breath test could reliably detect these cancers at an earlier stage that does not necessarily mean patients would live longer. It could be that deadly stomach and esophageal cancers are resistant to treatment early in their course, so that early detection would merely provide bad news sooner. The effectiveness of treatments is a separate question. The claim that the test is \u201c85% accurate overall\u201d also merits scrutiny. What appears to be an accurate test in a small group in which half of them have the disease, turns out to be not so favorable when you screen a normal population in which the disease prevalence is low. For instance, with a specificity of 80%, 20% of those without cancer will have a positive test (false positive rate of 20%). If you have 300 people (as in the study) there will be 60 false positives. In the study there were 150 people with cancer and 124 will have a positive test (80% sensitivity). So out of 184 positive tests, 124 will actually have cancer. That is a positive predictive value of 67% (assuming if I test positive, I have a 2\/3 chance of having cancer). Now take a hypothetical population where the prevalence of cancer is 1\/1000. There will be one person with cancer (they will probably have a positive test) but there will be 200 healthy people, without cancer, who will also have a positive test! In that case only 1 out of 201 positive tests is actually a person with cancer and the PPV is .005 or less than half of one percent. If the test is positive you have a 1\/201 chance of having cancer\u00a0(the other 200 people don\u2019t have cancer!). And those 200 other people have probably suffered some harm by having a false positive test. The release makes no mention of the harms of such a breath test. If the release is going to discuss potential unproven benefits, it should also mention the potential harms of screening tests including false positives, false negatives leading to over- or under-diagnosis. Chief among these harms would be falsely labeling healthy people as possibly having cancer and then subjecting them to invasive testing or even treatments that turn out to be unnecessary. Based on the statistics in the study abstract, an 81% specificity suggests that almost one-out-of-five people taking the test would be labeled as possibly having cancer when they don\u2019t. However, the 80% sensitivity suggests that at present about one-in-five people with cancer would be missed. (Computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer is about that). The numbers get much worse, as discussed above, when we consider using the test in the general population of people who aren\u2019t likely to have stomach cancer. The release suggests that the results of this trial provides evidence that a breath test could detect early stage cancer. However, that is not what the trial tested. The cancer patients in the trial had already been definitively diagnosed by conventional methods and most had advanced cancers. Since none of the participants had an early cancer that would not be detected by conventional methods, it is too early to say anything about the ability of such a breath test to detect early stage cancer. The trial abstract made clear that what researchers found was that about 85% of the time they could distinguish between a healthy person and a person with known cancer \u2014 but it then clearly noted that the breath test still has to be tried with participants who are more like the people who would actually be candidates for such a test in the future, if further research goes well. It is only near the very end of the release that it is noted that researchers still need to \u201cassess the ability of the test to pick up cases within a group that is likely to contain only a small percentage of cancers.\u201d We wish that important point had been emphasized, and much earlier in the release. The release doesn\u2019t engage in disease mongering and provides statistics on the numbers of stomach and esophageal cancers diagnosed globally each year, which matches other sources, and this puts the disease in context for readers. But when it notes that these types of cancers have a low 5-year survival rate of 15%, it would have been better to also tell readers that, while deadly, these two cancers are relatively uncommon (accounting for less than 10% of cancer diagnoses even after excluding common, nonmelanoma skin cancer) and appear to be largely preventable through improvements in diet and other living conditions. Funders are named in a sidebar to the release on the EurekAlert! website. Ideally, the funders would also be listed in the release text so that when the release is republished that information is available. The study abstract noted that the researchers stated they had no conflicts to declare. The release seems to be favorably comparing this breath test, which is a screening test, to conventional diagnostic methods, including endoscopy, even though there is not yet any evidence to support comparisons. The release would have been improved with a more careful distinction of who the screening test is geared for \u2014 is it a screening tool for healthy people to help rule out cancer or is it only for those with cancer symptoms? It is clear that the breath test is not available. The release did not make any predictions about when such a test might make its way through the full course of experimental trials. We\u2019ll give the release a pass on this since a breath test for screening for these specific cancers would be a new development, if proven effective, and the release does reference other research that formed the foundation for the new study. However, the release did not explain how this research is distinct from other work in the area. It would have been helpful had the release noted that many research teams around the world are evaluating breath tests to detect various types of cancer and other diseases. A report out of Israel in 2015 sparked wide news coverage of research into a breath test that appeared to be able to distinguish stomach cancer from pre-cancerous lesions, many of which do not develop into cancer. As noted above, most of the \u201cpromise\u201d of the breath test is based on hoped-for developments, not what was actually demonstrated in this trial. It is too early to say whether the ability to often distinguish between compounds in the breath of healthy people and those in the breath of people with established, often advanced, cancers means that it is at all likely that this test will someday be able to pick out important cancers in people in the general population.","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/GettyImages-496261169.jpg,http:\/\/www.eccocongress.org\/en\/Scientific-Programme\/Abstract-search?abstractid=30800,http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2017\/01\/30\/breath-test-could-save-lives-diagnosing-deadly-cancers-earlier\/,http:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/breath-test-could-be-cancer-lifesaver-10748231,http:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/uk-news\/breath-test-could-used-detect-9718978,https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/review\/can-a-breath-test-pick-up-stomach-cancers-healthday-story-has-notes-of-caution-but-also-veers-into-speculation\/","label":3,"subjects":"breath test,esophageal cancer,European CanCer Organisation (ECCO),stomach cancer","__index_level_0__":8523}
{"claim_id":"9555","hypothesis":"Botox Works As Well As Nerve Stimulator for Incontinence - Study","date_published":"October 10, 2016","explanation_1":"This news story\u00a0covers\u00a0a clinical trial that compared two different treatments for severe urinary urge incontinence in women. One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves. The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study\u2019s findings\u00a0(such as the\u00a0researchers\u2019 conclusions that\u00a0the results are of \u201cuncertain clinical importance\u201d). It also attempts to discuss cost, but provides no prices, and doesn\u2019t go far enough in detailing the potential harms of either treatment. And, because\u00a0the story\u2019s only interviewed\u00a0source has\u00a0potential conflicts of interest,\u00a0independent scrutiny was needed. Urinary incontinence is common, affecting millions of individuals, both women and men. The prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal result of aging. The condition is more prevalent in women, though beyond the age of 80, both men and women reportedly have similar rates. The kind of incontinence studied here\u2013\u201csevere refractory urge incontinence\u201d\u2013specifically means a person has an abnormally frequent urge to urinate, and it is\u00a0resistant to standard treatments.","fact_checkers":"Dave Mosher,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Joy Victory","premise":"We hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day. This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life. The closing line of the study brings this into question, i.e. how the work is of \u201cuncertain clinical importance,\u201d and good interview questions with both a study author and independent expert source could have greatly clarified the issue. Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com. And what of the harms of a neurostimulator implant? There\u2019s no mention of this, and the side effects are numerous. The story does a decent job of explaining that the study, stating it was \u201ca head to head comparison of a single Botox injection to the implanted medical device, assigning 381 women to randomly get one or the other treatment. The women were asked to keep diaries for six months.\u201d We\u2019re also told that the women had to have about 6 accidents over three days to be included in the study, and that other more standard treatments didn\u2019t help. The headline is also accurate, in terms of what the study found, and it doesn\u2019t overplay the results. In looking at the study, however, we\u2019ll note how we were struck by two things. First, the patients\u2019 reported impression of improvement in bladder leakage and function failed to pass a test of statistical significance, which undermines the story\u2019s claim that \u201cboth groups of women reported equal satisfaction.\u201d Second, the closing lines of the study point out how the treatment \u201cresulted in a small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain clinical importance.\u201d\u00a0This should have been explained to readers, along with details on what this means when researchers draw this conclusion. We don\u2019t see any language that would unnecessarily frighten a reader. The condition is real, uncomfortable, and carries\u00a0significant impact on people\u2019s daily lives. We didn\u2019t see\u00a0any backstopping of this study by an outside source. Although nonprofit websites are quoted, that material is used for purposes of background \u2014 not to assess the study\u2019s claims. Another significant oversight here is no mention of co-authors\u2019 financial relationships with the products used in both arms of the trial. (We give props to a Duke University press release about the study for pointing this out.) A quick Google search of the lead author\u2019s name and the term Medtronic reveals that she has been a consultant for the neurostimulator devicemaker, as well as for Allergan, Botox\u2019s manufacturer. We not only see a comparison to the medical device that the study focused on, but also methods that require no overt treatment, \u201csuch as weight loss, drinking less caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding lifting heavy objects.\u201d The story also notes that \u201c[e]xercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can help, as can \u2018bladder training\u2019 to accustom the body to urinating at regular times.\u201d The story could have been more clear that these treatments aren\u2019t likely to work for the women in this study who had a specific type of severe urge incontinence that is usually not responsive to exercise and other less invasive measures. Both of these treatments are widely available. But,\u00a0a description of the procedures themselves would have been helpful (they are both quite invasive and require seeing providers with special training). While \u2018regular\u2019 Botox cosmetic treatments can be easily given by various medical professionals, without specialized training, in the office, this may not be the case for Botox injections into the bladder. The story didn\u2019t establish what\u2019s novel about this study. As the news release states, the study was \u201cthe first randomized trial comparing the efficacy of two FDA-approved, third-line therapies in a severely affected population.\u201d We didn\u2019t catch any overtly copy\/pasted quotes or language that made its way into the story from the\u00a0Duke University news release.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Botox,urinary incontinence","__index_level_0__":9684}

Conversely, people in searches for unprofessional are mostly black \u2014 though for some reason, Elizabeth Banks as The Hunger Games\u2019 Effie Trinket makes a surprise appearance.Twitter user MalumDube pointed out the irony of a similar style worn by Rachel McAdams was somehow deemed \u201cunprofessional\u201d when worn by a black woman.British outlet\u00a0The Guardian published an editorial about the April 2016 controversy, in which the author described clicking through some of the images and explained their occasional context:In the case of the great hair debate, Google Images seems to have taken many of the pictures of black women wearing the \u201cunprofessional\u201d hairstyles were from blogs, articles and Pinterest boards. Many of these are by people of colour explicitly discussing and protesting against racist attitudes to hair. One image led me to a post criticising Hampton University\u2019s ban on dreadlocks and cornrows; another was linked with a post celebrating natural hair and the \u201cridiculous\u201d pressure to straighten it for the office; here\u2019s a rejection of the idea that big, natural curls are \u201cdistracting\u201d in a newsroom.One thing was clear between the 2016 popularity of a Google image search for \u201cunprofessional hair men\/women\u201d and \u201cprofessional hair men\/women\u201d \u2014 viral discourse in both instances appeared to influence the images returned by Google in both cases. Collages we found in the results on June 19 2020 often accompanied reporting on the Google results, pushing down what may have been earlier, accurately described results before tens of thousands of Google users tested the hypothesis.On June 10 2020, The Shade Room published a statement from Cathy Edwards, Vice President of Google Images, about the discussion. Edwards reiterated the claim that articles decrying descriptions of black women\u2019s natural hair as \u201cunprofessional\u201d made up some but not all of the images:Google spoke exclusively to us to explain these image results, which are usually linked to articles that are actually denouncing the biases that black men and women face when it comes to their hair and society\u2019s idea of what professional hair is supposed to look like.\u201cOur Google Images search systems rely on a number of factors, including word matching, to surface results,\u201d Cathy Edwards, VP of Google Images, tells us. \u201cFor many of the results, the words \u2018unprofessional hairstyles\u2019 appear in the articles, and many of these stories are rightly denouncing the discrimination people of color face when it comes to their hair.\u201dWhile the images may be alarming, for the purposes of clarity, Google has taken the liberty of adding captions to help people under the relevancy of the images.\u201cWhile we include captions to help people understand why these images are relevant to the query, we acknowledge that the association can be concerning and painful to see without the fuller context,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cEnsuring that all people and communities are able to find helpful results in Google Images is something we care about deeply and are actively working to improve.\u201dRating the veracity of the claim that\u00a0Google search results for the terms \u201cprofessional hairstyles men,\u201d \u201cunprofessional hairstyles men,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cprofessional hairstyles women,\u201d and \u201cunprofessional hairstyles women\u201d demonstrated racial bias was difficult due in part to how viral the claim became. Facebook posts and tweets with tens of thousands of shares reshuffled the results, and Google could have changed their algorithms in the two-week period between the June 6 2020 tweets and our June 19 2020 fact check. It is true that some of the results remained (and were the subject of scrutiny in 2016), but the results we evaluated were influenced by the interest generated by the claims \u2014 and other forces that remained invisible.Comments","sources":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fprofessional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-versus-professional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-google-image-results%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/Denzel_Success\/status\/1269415941827371011, https:\/\/twitter.com\/dave_fieri\/status\/1269256671198679041, https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2016\/apr\/08\/does-google-unprofessional-hair-results-prove-algorithms-racist-, https:\/\/www.mic.com\/articles\/140092\/if-you-google-unprofessional-hairstyles-for-work-these-are-the-problematic-results, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-officer-mcmuffin-stacy-talbert-a-security-guard-not-law-enforcement\/, https:\/\/t.co\/xBBR8OZ7Cr, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27Unprofessional+Hairstyles+for+Men+or+Women%27+Versus+%27Professional+Hairstyles+for+Men+or+Women%27+Google+Image+Results&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fprofessional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-versus-professional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-google-image-results%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=professional+hairstyles+men&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjmz_Ct4Y7qAhWGDt8KHWKeC0UQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=professional+hairstyles+men&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIHCAAQsQMQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIAFD6OVj6OWD8O2gAcAB4AIABNIgBNJIBATGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img&ei=xyXtXqbQMYad_AbivK6oBA&bih=965&biw=2025, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fprofessional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-versus-professional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-google-image-results%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/, https:\/\/theshaderoom.com\/google-explains-why-a-search-for-unprofessional-hairstyles-shows-mostly-black-people-exclusive\/?fbclid=IwAR14oGnnWeDi1J35v2CTihPT0cXbBotPKMXD6thy8m4n9Y9PCosOdfspgX0, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fprofessional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-versus-professional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-google-image-results%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/legacy3684\/posts\/3249266698451318, https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=professional+hairstyles+women&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwizmKay4Y7qAhUKHN8KHWzkDswQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=professional+hairstyles+women&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMggIABAIEAcQHjIGCAAQBRAeMgYIABAFEB4yBggAEAUQHjIGCAAQBRAeOgYIABAHEB5Q8aUIWLqnCGC_qwhoAHAAeACAATmIAXGSAQEymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=0SXtXvPrBIq4_AbsyLvgDA&bih=965&biw=2025, https:\/\/twitter.com\/dave_fieri\/status\/1269256671198679041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/t.co\/6bJKhJa1w3, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/copied-from-an-osha-certified-friend\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fprofessional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-versus-professional-hairstyles-for-men-or-women-google-image-results%2F, https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=unprofessional+hairstyles+men&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi4_Z304Y7qAhUGad8KHUXFDZ8Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=unprofessional+hairstyles+men&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECCMQJzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoGCAAQBxAeOggIABAIEAcQHjoHCAAQsQMQQ1CziwRYtaIEYI2pBGgAcAB4AIABOYgB2QGSAQE0mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=WybtXvjjFYbS_QbFirf4CQ&bih=965&biw=2025, https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=unprofessional+hairstyles+women&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjag9iW4o7qAhVvieAKHeGrBvkQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=unprofessional+hairstyles+women&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIFCAAQsQMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BggAEAcQHjoICAAQCBAHEB5Q8uMFWNXkBWCq5gVoAHAAeACAATOIAWWSAQEymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWc&sclient=img&ei=oybtXpqmJe-Sggfh15rIDw&bih=965&biw=2025, https:\/\/twitter.com\/Denzel_Success\/status\/1269415941827371011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":107}
{"claim_id":"9506","hypothesis":"Tweaking brains with \u2018smart drugs\u2019 to get ahead in Silicon Valley","date_published":"June 14, 2017","explanation_1":"This story about purported brain-boosting pills would have been easier to swallow if it came with a stronger shot of skepticism. The story would have benefited greatly from at least one source who isn\u2019t involved in the cognitive-enhancement movement. It does a better job of describing the availability of these supplements and the hyper-competitive culture that feeds this emerging market. The term \u201cnootropics\u201d applies to a wide variety of substances that apparently require no safety or efficacy trials, no FDA approval, and no prescription from a doctor. As a result, media coverage is often consumers\u2019 only tool to counter the marketing hype when attempting to determine whether these products will do them good or harm, or simply waste their money. Sadly critical coverage is in short supply. Back in 2015, HealthNewsReview.org Associate Editor Kathlyn Stone wrote that nootropics were \u201cunder the radar\u201d of journalists, despite heavy marketing targeted at students and young professionals. That appears to be changing, but journalists need to be cognizant of their role as consumer watchdogs.","fact_checkers":"Mary Chris Jaklevic,Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH,Joy Victory","premise":"There\u2019s no discussion of cost. We found one drug cited in this story \u2014 piracetam \u2014 online for $39.99 for 180 capsules. For those seeking a cocktail of supposed brain boosters, startup Nootrobox charges $135 for \u201call the nootropics you need to enhance your cognitive state for one month.\u201d The company explains: \u201cCognitive performance is an active, long-term investment.\u201d (Notably, piracetam isn\u2019t on Nootrobox\u2019s ingredient list. For more on that, read the section on availability.) The story doesn\u2019t quantify any known benefits of these brain enhancers, for example if memory increased by a certain percent. Harms are addressed\u2013enough to be Satisfactory for this criteria. But the discussion is confusing. The story initially says nootropics have \u201csupposedly few side effects and low toxicity.\u201d Later it states: As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d In contrast, consider these unequivocal cautions in a similar Mercury News story last fall, starting in the seventh paragraph: Research into the cognitive benefits of nootropics is still in its early stages, and some experts worry about the long-term health effects of ingesting potent synthetic smart drugs, which are largely unregulated. Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said. This story falls into the trap of relying on positive anecdotes as evidence, citing an entrepreneur who \u201ccredits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees,\u201d as well as a physician who said he with experimented with piracetam and found it \u201chelpful.\u201d Also troublesome is this statement: \u201cPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities.\u201d\u00a0 Saying it\u2019s \u201cwell studied\u201d in the same sentence as giving purported benefits is confusing and may lead readers to assume incorrectly that these benefits were proven in studies. Lastly, the story quotes advocates of fasting without cautioning that what works in mice may not apply to humans. Comments Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging: \u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases.\u201d In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cconclusive evidence from animal studies.\u201d To its credit, the story does eventually\u2013but very briefly\u2013explore the quality of the evidence, mainly via\u00a0this comment from Duke University Health System researcher Murali Doraiswamy: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence.\u201d There\u2019s no outright disease-mongering here, but the preposterous quote that it is \u201cthe few who are getting ahead who are using supplements\u201d should have been challenged. That makes it sounds like \u201cnormal\u201d people are in some way deficient. The story lacks comment from an independent expert who\u2019s not involved with selling, prescribing or taking nootropics or some other cognition-boosting product. The story doesn\u2019t address proven strategies to improve mental skills such as good nutrition, adequate sleep, social engagement, cognitively challenging activities, and exercise. The story does a good job here, although it injects confusion when it states that in the U.S. piracetam \u201ccan be sold only for research purposes,\u201d but later says that piracetam and similar drugs are available online. In fact, the FDA at least twice warned suppliers, in 2010 and 2012, that piracetam was classified as a drug and could not be sold as a supplement. According to online accounts, that FDA action prompted major retailers to stop carrying it, which could explain why it\u2019s not present in some products marketed as nootropics. The story also states: \u201cA number of companies now market nootropic \u2018stacks,\u2019 or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\u201d There story gives perspective, mentioning that piracetam has been around for decades, though newer formulations are on the market, and that companies have recently begun marketing \u201cstacks\u201d with multiple supplements. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/2015\/12\/flying-under-journalists-radars-brain-enhancing-supplements-dubbed-nootropics\/","label":3,"subjects":"neurology,smart drugs","__index_level_0__":5579}
{"claim_id":"37414","hypothesis":"Any history of antidepressant use disqualifies a person from the military and\/or the draft.","date_published":"January 9, 2020","explanation_1":"Does Using Antidepressants Disqualify You from a Military Draft?","fact_checkers":"  Kim LaCapria  ","premise":"After a January 3 2020 United States-led strike killed Iranian\u00a0Maj. Gen. Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad, Iraq, speculation flew about impending war, eventually turning into rumors about an American military draft.On the day Suleimani was killed, news organizations\u00a0addressed\u00a0the possibility of war with Iran:A deadly opening attack. Nearly untraceable, ruthless proxies spreading chaos on multiple continents. Costly miscalculations. And thousands \u2014 perhaps hundreds of thousands \u2014 killed in a conflict that would dwarf the war in Iraq.Welcome to the US-Iran war, which has the potential to be one of the worst conflicts in history.Readers expressed anxiety and fear as they contemplated a new war, and several discussions turned to military recruiting and the possibility of a draft. Some people posted questions on Facebook about what a draft might look like in 2020:I saw a meme somewhere claiming that being on antidepressants disqualifies you from the US military draft but haven\u2019t found a definitive answer for whether that\u2019s true. I see posts saying that if you want to join the military and have depression, then you could be disqualified, but if you still want to and can be considered stable, then you have a fair shot. What about people who would be forced to join thru a draft tho?Concerns about the prospect of war with Iran and who might be conscripted for the potential conflict also emerged in meme form:As usual, discourse also took place\u00a0on Twitter, where speculation also involved ADHD medications like Adderall as possible draft disqualifiers:bruh how they gonna draft any of gen z if it's required to be off antidepressants for 2 years\u2014 Jadyn (@wetritzcracker) January 4, 2020me finding out they can\u2019t draft me bc i\u2019m on antidepressants #WWIII pic.twitter.com\/4gP2ZoyUJe\u2014 Tori (@torideprow) January 3, 2020Military also won\u2019t draft you if you are employed, have taken any antidepressants or drugs for mental health including adderall https:\/\/t.co\/cs3ZhrX3Yf\u2014 koplin (@kopi_wan) January 3, 2020All of these assertions were underpinned by uncertainty \u2014 both about whether a military draft could conceivably be in the cards, and whether something like having been prescribed Lexapro or Zoloft was sufficient to avoid being drafted or conscripted to fight a war.For context, the last time the United States drafted anyone into service was 1973, nearly half a century prior to 2020 speculation about war with Iran. However, ongoing discussion about how a 2020 draft might appear was disrupted by a series of hoax text messages received by many Americans several days after Soleimani\u2019s death.On January 7 2020, the official United States Army Recruiting account tweeted\u00a0out a fact check confirming that citizens had received text message notifications they\u2019d been contacted about a draft:Fact check: The @USArmy is NOT contacting anyone regarding the draft.Text messages currently circulating are false and are not official Army communications.Read more: https:\/\/t.co\/csGpTQNfQc\u2014 U.S. Army Recruiting (@usarec) January 7, 2020Twitter users in the comments asked whether a draft could occur, and @usarec responded\u00a0with information about the legislative structure of a draft:The U.S. Army does not control the draft. Per the @SSS_gov, the agency that oversees Selective Service system, in the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the President would need to pass official legislation to enact a draft.\u2014 U.S. Army Recruiting (@usarec) January 7, 2020U.S. Army Recruiting Command indicated in their fact check that they had received multiple queries about \u201cfake text messages\u201d announcing a draft, and clarified:U.S. Army Recruiting Command has received multiple calls and emails about these fake text messages and wants to ensure Americans understand these texts are false and were not initiated by this command or the U.S. Army.The decision to enact a draft is not made at or by U.S. Army Recruiting Command. The Selective Service System, a separate agency outside of the Department of Defense, is the organization that manages registration for the Selective Service.\u201cThe Selective Service System is conducting business as usual,\u201d according to the Selective Service System\u2019s official Facebook page. \u201cIn the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the President would need to pass official legislation to authorize a draft.\u201dThe draft has not been in effect since 1973. The military has been an all-volunteer force since that time. Registering for the Selective Service does not enlist a person into the military.Army recruiting operations are proceeding as normal.But as evidenced by the reply embedded above, worries about the draft nevertheless persisted. And an aspect of that lingering fear involved whether antidepressants (or therapeutic stimulants) disqualified people from being drafted.As indicated in the\u00a0U.S. Army Recruiting Command\u2019s Twitter replies and fact check, no one has been drafted in the United States since 1973. As such, any information about a potential future draft can only be based on existing information regarding volunteer recruitment.Privately-run resource Military.com hosted a FAQ about recruitment, and question number nine had to do with antidepressants and enlistment, not a draft. Answers were compiled from information submitted on forums \u201cmonitored and answered by real recruiters,\u201d and the scope of the question about whether \u201canti-depressants disqualifying\u201d was wide. Two answers were submitted, with a broad scope of application to putative draftees and recruits.According to that information, antidepressants disqualified potential recruits for a year after ceasing to take the medication. Moreover, the answering recruiter said self-initiated cessation was insufficient to enlist. A second question appeared to have been answered by an Air Force member:Response 1: Anti depressants are disqualifying for 1 year after you stop taking them. You MUST stop with your doctors advice, DO NOT stop on your own. These medications often have to be reduced slowly to lower side effects and reduce risk of relapse. Once you are off and depression free for 1 year get copies of your treatment paperwork, including therapy notes and take them with you to your recruiter. They will submit the documents to [United States Military Entrance Processing Command\/Station, or MEPS] for review. MEPS will either DQ you, allow you to physical and enlist, or allow you to physical with a waiver (most likely).Response 2: You\u2019ll need to bring my medical records from the doctor who prescribed the anti-depressants. You\u2019ll go to MEPS, take the [Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB] but your processing will be terminated at a certain point due to being honest about depression. Your records will be sent to the [Air Force] surgeon general\u2019s office for review. This supposedly takes between six weeks and three months \u2014 mine took a full three months. If the waiver is granted, you\u2019ll be cleared to return to MEPS. On your return trip, they\u2019ll do a height\/weight check then send you offsite to a psych consult. The doctor will then send his recommendation to MEPS where you will be reviewed further. This took nearly five weeks for me. If you are deemed fit for service, you will return to MEPS for job selection. Contrary to what I was initially told, depression rules out many jobs in the AF.It appears that the military and its branches had a fluid and changing policy on mental health conditions, medication, and medical history. In November 2017, USA Today reported on a previously undisclosed policy allowing people with a medical history of mental illness to obtain waivers and serve:People with a history of \u201cself-mutilation,\u201d bipolar disorder, depression and drug and alcohol abuse can now seek waivers to join the Army under an unannounced policy enacted in August [2017], according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.The decision to open Army recruiting to those with mental health conditions comes as the service faces the challenging goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018. To meet last year\u2019s goal of 69,000, the Army accepted more recruits who fared poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers granted for marijuana use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.U.S. Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Randy Taylor told the outlet that the new guidelines were not necessarily hard and fast ones:\u201cWith the additional data available, Army officials can now consider applicants as a whole person, allowing a series of Army leaders and medical professionals to review the case fully to assess the applicant\u2019s physical limitations or medical conditions and their possible impact upon the applicant\u2019s ability to complete training and finish an Army career \u2026 These waivers are not considered lightly.\u201dIn April 2018, ArmyTimes.com\u00a0reported that relaxation of prior policies around medical and mental health histories had caused controversy following the November 2017\u00a0USA Today\u00a0piece. Again, the specifics of the policy did not seem to be fully clear at that time, and Army higher-ups described the changes as something of a case-by-case basis adopted for children of servicemen and women with more comprehensive childhood records:The Army\u2019s personnel chief responded to the memo in November [2017] by clarifying that it was mistakenly distributed, but adding that the service was beginning to have more of an open mind about recruits\u2019 mental health history.\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that the conditions themselves have been unfairly characterized,\u201d Lt. Gen. Thomas Seamands, the Army G-1, said in a statement at the time. \u201cFor example, a child who received behavioral counseling at age 10 would be forever banned from military service were it not for the ability to make a waiver request.\u201d\u2026\u00a0And in fact, it has been a concern for many military families. A spate of military children have been kicked out of initial military training after their childhood medical records were added to their service member records, sometimes revealing that they had turned to therapy as young children.It was also, as noted, a focus on volunteer enlistment \u2014 not a policy enacted with a draft in mind:\u201cThe waivers are really indicating to me that our recruiters are doing exactly what we\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey said [in April 2018]. \u201cIf they see something in the record that is of concern or is a question of meeting a DoD standard, they ask for somebody to review it.\u201dIn January 2019, the\u00a0Psychological Health Center of Excellence (or PHCoE, formerly known as the Deployment Health Clinical Center) Clinician\u2019s Corner blog included an entry titled \u201cNavy Changes Policy on Psychotropic Medications and Aviation.\u201d It discussed whether a service member who was diagnosed with a mental health condition could maintain their military flight status during treatment, explaining:Can a service member who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and is being treated with psychotropic medication maintain their military flight status while in treatment? YES! The use of psychotropic medications was disqualifying for U. S. Naval Aviators (pilots, flight officers, air traffic controllers and aircrew members) before November 2018. After this date, the U.S. Navy Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide (ARWG)(link is external) was updated to allow Navy and Marine Corps personnel who are on a stable dose of FDA-approved psychotropic medications to maintain their flight status during treatment.According to the PHCoE blog, the first Navy waivers were granted in 2017 \u2014 around the time the first report disclosing the existence of waivers appeared:The first waiver for a class of psychotropic medication use in Army aircrews was granted in 2004 for a diagnosis of chronic pain. Currently, Army aviators on stable doses of selected medications for most mental health diagnoses are eligible to maintain flight status. Similarly, Air Force policy allows designated personnel to fly while on monotherapy with one of four approved medications for treatment of specified conditions after the prescribed waiting periods officially went into effect in 2013. The Air Force is currently conducting a 20-year study to follow airmen on antidepressants, where results from the first five years found that no antidepressant medication has been associated with any Air Force mishap since the protocol started in 2013.The first waivers granted in the Navy began in 2017, for diagnoses of major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Upon review of selected individuals, the Consult Advisory Board voted to allow aviators, in specified flying billets (e.g. dual-piloted, non-tactical aircraft), to be eligible for waiver consideration with continued therapy with FDA-approved psychotropic medication(s). Consideration for a waiver may be requested after a suitable period of observation in a non-flying status has elapsed, provided that the dose of the medication(s) is stable and the clinical condition is determined to be in stable remission. The duration of this period of observation in a non-flying status is dictated by the psychiatric diagnosis and is outlined in the relevant section of the ARWG.Operation Military Kids\u2019 \u201c20 Health Conditions That May Not Allow You to Join the Military\u201d page was updated on January 3 2020, and it contained a section on depression. According to that site, a history of depression (and presumably having taken antidepressants) might make it \u201cdifficult\u201d (but not impossible) to enlist:Since the U.S. Armed Forces deal with arming individuals with powerful weapons it must tread on mental health very carefully. Though people with mental health concerns are very good people that are still capable of living high-quality lives, the U.S. Military is very strict on how it handles mood disorders \u2026 [That] means that if you or someone you know that is considering enlisting in the U.S. Military has been diagnosed with [depression] in the past, it may be difficult to join.Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were labeled \u201cpossibly disqualifying,\u201d while bipolar disorder was described as \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder was also described as a disqualifying condition, with the following caveat:The military is currently reexamining its approach for ADHD and has noted recently that it might start assessing circumstances on a case by case basis.After conflict between the United States and Iran was initiated due to Suleimani\u2019s death, speculation about war led to rumors that using antidepressants disqualified Americans from any military draft. An unrelated hoax exploited simmering draft fears, leading military recruiters to reiterate that reinstatement of the draft was a legislatively complicated process. Given that nearly half a century had passed since the previous active draft, the only up-to-date information available had to do with voluntary enlistment. As of 2017, the United States military had relaxed their policies about mental health and antidepressants to some degree, but those policies appeared to be in ongoing flux. Further, it was incredibly difficult to extrapolate how such fluid guidelines might apply to an involuntary enlistment process or draft. Because of this, we have rated this claim Decontextualized due to the complexity of its elements.","sources":"https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/australia-scott-morrison-bushfires-disinformation\/, https:\/\/recruiting.army.mil\/News\/Article-Display\/Article\/2051787\/urgent-news-army-recruiting-discredits-military-draft-texts\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/wetritzcracker\/status\/1213600480732934144, https:\/\/wpde.com\/news\/local\/memes-about-wwiii-and-military-draft-inflate-uncertainty-heres-the-truth, https:\/\/www.armytimes.com\/news\/your-army\/2018\/04\/20\/after-waiver-controversy-army-to-evaluate-troops-mental-health-pasts-on-case-by-case-basis\/, https:\/\/www.operationmilitarykids.org\/military-disqualifications\/#depression, https:\/\/twitter.com\/the_fat_bro\/status\/1214606604655636481, https:\/\/www.vox.com\/world\/2019\/7\/8\/18693297\/us-iran-war-trump-nuclear-iraq, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Does+Using+Antidepressants+Disqualify+You+from+a+Military+Draft%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/live-updates\/iran-commander-vows-harsher-revenge-against-us-relief-in-tehran-today-after-trump-speech-2020-01-09\/, https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/politics\/2017\/11\/12\/army-lifts-ban-recruits-history-self-mutilation-other-mental-health-issues\/853131001\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214638966126891009, https:\/\/t.co\/4gP2ZoyUJe, https:\/\/twitter.com\/wetritzcracker\/status\/1213600480732934144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214644346320048130, https:\/\/www.military.com\/join-armed-forces\/military-recruiting-process-faqs.html, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/kopi_wan\/status\/1213157117080662016, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/kopi_wan\/status\/1213157117080662016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214644346320048130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/deelightfuller\/status\/1213488354697895936, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/were-an-army-veterans-prosthetic-legs-repossessed-after-a-va-and-medicare-dispute\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/USArmy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/t.co\/csGpTQNfQc, https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/01\/08\/794729081\/u-s-army-alert-you-are-not-being-drafted, https:\/\/t.co\/cs3ZhrX3Yf, https:\/\/www.pdhealth.mil\/news\/blog\/navy-changes-policy-psychotropic-medications-and-aviation, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214638966126891009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/SSS_gov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/WWIII?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/torideprow\/status\/1213216042408972288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/torideprow\/status\/1213216042408972288","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":2330}
{"claim_id":"9245","hypothesis":"Even partial steroid treatment can benefit extremely preterm infants, NIH study suggests","date_published":"October 18, 2016","explanation_1":"This news release by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) covers research findings on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment in pregnant women expecting preterm delivery, as published in JAMA Pediatrics. Although women likely to deliver before 34 weeks are routinely given steroid treatment to reduce the chance of complications, physicians weren\u2019t sure whether a partial course of treatment would provide the same \u2014 or any \u2014 benefits. In this new study, researchers concluded that ANS therapy was dose-dependent in providing protective effects against death or neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm infants. The release claims that even partial steroid treatment can\u00a0 benefit those born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. Details on funding sources and treatment\u2019s context are given high up in the news release. It also starts out well by providing some relevant figures, such as the number of subjects in the study, their gestational ages and follow-up times. However, other important quantitative data aren\u2019t disclosed at all, such as the extent of the treatment\u2019s benefits in the three groups, as well as the costs associated with steroid therapy. Instead, only sweeping, vague comparative language is used to illustrate complications and other outcomes, which leaves the reader wondering how beneficial steroid treatment really is. Another major point that was not mentioned was the study\u2019s limitations \u2014 namely that this was an observational cohort study that cannot establish cause and effect. Patients were not blinded to their treatments and were not randomized, which led to an unequal distribution of patients in the 3 groups in terms of socioeconomic status and other infant variables. In the end, the complete ANS treatment group already had distinct advantages from these factors in achieving better outcomes. Although studies on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment already exist in the body of literature, there hasn\u2019t been much research looking at dose-dependent effects of ANS on extremely premature infants, especially in regard to early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other studies have looked into partial ANS courses and rates of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease among infants. Steroids are routinely given to pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks and are considered to be standard treatment. However, there is no clear protocol on administering ANS treatment when premature delivery is approaching, since completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours. If the latest research shows that even partial ANS treatment provides benefits to preterm infants, this should be reported to empower patients and to guide clinical practice.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"The two antenatal steroids (ANS) used in this study included betamethasone and dexamethasone, but their costs were never mentioned. A complete course of ANS was defined as 2 intramuscular doses of betamethasone administered 24 hours apart or 4 doses of dexamethasone administered 12 hours apart. According to drugs.com, 500 mL of dexamethasone costs $23.94. Our online search didn\u2019t uncover any price estimates for liquid Betamethasone. Drugs.com only lists topical Betamethasone prices. We always like to see a ballpark range of costs in news releases, so consumers can estimate their therapy costs. Since costs are not discussed in the news release, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. It\u2019s worth noting here that the actual costs of the steroids pale in comparison to the cost of the overall treatment of these infants. If the partial treatment is even\u00a0partially effective, that could lower future medical care costs. Although the news release gives figures for the number of study participants and their gestational ages, it doesn\u2019t provide any quantitative data on the benefits of steroid therapy. Instead, it uses broad, vague language, such as \u201csignificant differences in rates of death.\u201d It also states, \u201cInfants in the complete treatment group fared best,\u201d and \u201cinfants in the partial treatment group fared better than untreated infants.\u201d As we have pointed out in previous reviews, the word \u201csignificant\u201d is confusing and ambiguous, since it could mean \u201cstatistically significant\u201d or \u201cremarkable\/substantial,\u201d the colloquial use of the term. Without any numbers to put \u201cbest\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d into perspective, readers are left wondering just how well each group fared. The original journal article gives the rates of various complications in percentages. Since the study\u2019s primary objective was to compare the rates of death or neurodevelopmental impairment in infants born between 22-27 weeks, it would have been sufficient to disclose only these figures for the three groups. Researchers wrote, \u201cDeath or neurodevelopmental impairment occurred in 68.1%, 54.4% and 48.1% of patients in the no, partial and complete ANS (antenatal steroids) groups, respectively.\u201d Since the news release does not quantify the benefits for its readers, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. Every intervention carries risks, and antenatal steroid therapy is no exception. Although this therapy is generally deemed to be safe, some studies have reported undesired effects on the mother\u2019s immune system and metabolism, as well as reduction of fetal heart rate and breathing movements. A multiple course of antenatal steroids might even slow fetal intrauterine growth and lower neonatal birth weight. Since harms were not addressed, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating. The news release does an appropriate job disclosing the number of participants and follow-up times and listing treatment groups and outcome measurements (although not quantitatively). However, it doesn\u2019t detail any of the study\u2019s limitations. This was an observational cohort study, which means it\u2019s difficult to determine causation, since patients weren\u2019t randomized and blinded to their treatments. Researchers also acknowledged that there was an unequal distribution of patients in the three groups because of the observational design. The complete antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment group had distinct socioeconomic advantages compared to the partial treatment and no treatment groups. For example, the complete ANS group were comprised of individuals more likely to have a high school education, be white and married, and less likely to be on public insurance, compared to the other two groups. The infants of the ANS group were also more likely to have a higher mean birth weight and a higher mean gestational age, compared to the other two groups. Since none of these points were addressed, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no disease mongering in the news release. The news release identifies the funding source in its headline and first sentence \u2013 the National Institutes of Health. It later adds that NIH\u2019s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences also provided funding for the study. There was no mention of conflicts of interest, since there were none reported in the original journal article. Alternative therapies are not discussed in the news release. For women who are more likely to deliver prematurely, they may receive a progesterone shot \u2014 the most common being the 17-OHPC shot \u2014 to prevent preterm birth. Other medications, such as tocolytics, which include ritodrine, magnesium sulfate, calcium channel blockers and indomethacin, can be administered to delay delivery. Additionally, women in preterm labor usually are given antibiotics, as some studies have suggested that antibiotics may prolong pregnancy and reduce problems in the newborn. Since none of these alternatives are mentioned, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating. The news release reveals high up in the article that steroids are a standard treatment for pregnant women expecting preterm delivery, or before 34 weeks. \u201cThese drugs are known to reduce the chance of complications and heath among premature infants,\u201d it states. Since the release makes it clear that steroids are nothing new, we give it a Satisfactory rating here. As implied by the news release, the main objective of the research was to look at the varying levels of treatment \u2014 in this case, no, partial and complete antenatal courses. Previously, physicians may have opted to forgo treatment when premature delivery is on the horizon, since an entire treatment course takes at least 48 hours. But according to the release, the new study gives \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that even a partial course can provide some benefit. The release might better have characterized the study as yielding minimally statistically significant results rather than \u201cstrong evidence.\u201d But overall, the news release merits a Satisfactory rating for novelty. The news release does not use unjustifiable, sensational language.","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/iStock_5843677_MEDIUM.jpg,http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamapediatrics\/article-abstract\/2557387,http:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/50\/4\/515,https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8165070","label":3,"subjects":"antenatal steroid treatment,NIH,preterm infants","__index_level_0__":7578}
