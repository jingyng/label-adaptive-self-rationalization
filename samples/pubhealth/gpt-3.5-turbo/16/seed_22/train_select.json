(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) However, in this case, it is accurate. Africans in at least one Chinese city are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to COVID-19 fears. Numerous legitimate news reports describe such targeted evictions, stemming from fears of another COVID-19 outbreak, in the southern China city of Guangzhou. Home to many Africans, Guangzhou has long been one of China\u2019s main commercial and trading centers. One report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as \"\"Little Africa\"\" are being forced to remain inside their apartments \u2014 even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine \u2014 and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to Al Jazeera. President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. But China has denied racism in the effort. But the actions are widespread enough, according to the Associated Press, that African officials are confronting China over racist treatment of Africans, including Africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe said: \"\"It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents. China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\"\" The Guangdong provincial government has responded to concerns about discrimination by calling China and Africa good friends, partners and brothers, according to the BBC. More than two dozen Africans told CNN about being left without a home, being subject to random testing for COVID-19, or being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Photos and videos posted on social media showed Africans sleeping on sidewalks or waiting under shop awnings after being ordered out of their apartments and hotel rooms, the Washington Post reported. And community leaders told the BBC that hundreds of Africans had been evicted after online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among African people. A video shared on Facebook claims that \"\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold.\"\" Numerous news articles report that, amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, China has focused on foreigners as a possible source of the virus, and Africans in the southern China city of Guangzhou are being evicted from their homes.

Home to many Africans, Guangzhou has long been one of China\u2019s main commercial and trading centers. One report cited a case in which a police officer accompanied a landlord on an eviction of an African. Black residents in a part of Guangzhou known as \"\"Little Africa\"\" are being forced to remain inside their apartments \u2014 even if they have not traveled anywhere that would warrant a quarantine \u2014 and submit to coronavirus tests, the Washington Post reported. Chinese officials say they are trying to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, focusing on foreigners, according to Al Jazeera. President Xi Jinping urged authorities to carefully watch for imported cases from \u200bother countries, state news agency Xinhua reported. But China has denied racism in the effort. But the actions are widespread enough, according to the Associated Press, that African officials are confronting China over racist treatment of Africans, including Africans being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe said: \"\"It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents. China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\"\" The Guangdong provincial government has responded to concerns about discrimination by calling China and Africa good friends, partners and brothers, according to the BBC. More than two dozen Africans told CNN about being left without a home, being subject to random testing for COVID-19, or being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Photos and videos posted on social media showed Africans sleeping on sidewalks or waiting under shop awnings after being ordered out of their apartments and hotel rooms, the Washington Post reported. And community leaders told the BBC that hundreds of Africans had been evicted after online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among African people. A video shared on Facebook claims that \"\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold.\"\" Numerous news articles report that, amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, China has focused on foreigners as a possible source of the virus, and Africans in the southern China city of Guangzhou are being evicted from their homes. African leaders have called out the evictions as racist.\"n\nClaim: \u201cAfricans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold\u201d as \u201cChinese nationals blame them for the rising number of new coronavirus cases in the country.\u201d\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"True. The evidence provided clearly shows that Africans in China, particularly in Guangzhou, are facing widespread evictions and discrimination related to COVID-19 fears. There are numerous legitimate news reports, eye-witness accounts, and social media posts confirming that Africans are being forced to sleep outside in the cold due to fears of a second wave of the coronavirus. Therefore, the claim that Africans in China are being forced to sleep outside is true based on the evidence provided."}

Both totals exceeded one-day records from just a day earlier. Despite the grim figures, Cuomo said overall trends still appeared positive. Cuomo cited a drop in new hospitalizations and other data as evidence that New York\u2019s social-distancing restrictions were \u201cbending the curve,\u201d helping to gain some control over the infection rate. New York is one of 42 states where governors have issued \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders and closed all non-essential workplaces. While public health experts say such measures are vital for controlling the contagion, the restrictions have strangled the U.S. economy, leading to widespread layoffs, upheavals on Wall Street and projections of a severe recession. Cuomo said the loss of life would likely continue at current levels or increase in days ahead as critically ill patients die after prolonged bouts hooked up to ventilators. U.S. deaths due to coronavirus topped 14,700 on Wednesday, the second highest reported number in the world behind Italy, according to a Reuters tally. New York state accounts for over a third of the U.S. total.

{"claim_id":10187,"hypothesis":"Dogs Sniff Out Lung Cancer in Humans","date_published":"August 17, 2011","explanation_1":"Other than the too-simple headline, this story about four dogs in Europe finding 71 out of 100 lung cancers is pretty responsible. For readers who get all the way to the end, it will be clear that the dog-detection system is far from available now and might require technology to replicate it into a device that works accurately almost all the time. But we wish the story had looked at some other valid questions about the research: They don\u2019t provide any data about test-retest over time, or the other challenges that might exist with training large numbers of dogs over time and space. The US spends an estimated $10 billion on treatment for patients with lung cancer. It is the second most common form of cancer in the US, and the leading cause of cancer death. An estimated 220,000 people will be diagnosed this year and about 157,000 will die of lung cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. If there were a way to detect it earlier, it might add years to those lives and save the cost of more invasive testing for those who don\u2019t have the disease. This story does not include any of this context for the reader. Of course, preventing smoking addiction in the population also helps save lives.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"The story does not mention costs. At the very least, what does it cost to train dogs?

Thus, when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the U.S. military living in Mexico after they had been\u00a0deported from the United States (a story we\u00a0previously reported on) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite. However, deported veterans exist, although no one \u2014 not even the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 knows how many. Their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream American consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in Tijuana. \u201cThe Bunker,\u201d also known as the Deported Veterans Support House, is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in Mexico\u2019s border town of Tijuana, and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the United States military, who fought everywhere from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Former Army paratrooper Hector Barajas, 39, opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who, like him, had been deported: \u201cI started The Bunker because there was a need,\u201d Barajas told us. He said since his deportation, he had been meeting others like him living in Tijuana, and discovered that they lived throughout Mexico\u00a0\u2014 but not just Mexico. There are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries, he said. Since then, The Bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause: Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home. We shouldn\u2019t honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for. It may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the United States military does not automatically confer citizenship, but it doesn\u2019t. It can smooth\u00a0the way, provided the aspiring\u00a0citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe. However, it\u2019s not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume (having never been told otherwise) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship, and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait. Sometimes, too, there are bureaucratic foulups. One man was deported after\u00a0he was unable to attend a hearing, despite his reason: he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time. Others do everything the way they\u2019re supposed to, filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings, but still get deported, and no one seems to know\u00a0exactly why. Once they are outside the U.S., they maintain a\u00a0legal right to VA benefits such as healthcare, and to whatever funds they might be entitled, but they have no way of getting back into the United States to obtain that assistance, and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them. Because these particular veterans are either in the United States on green cards or without documentation after their discharges, they can be deported with cause, or for no reason at all. Past and present members of the armed forces\u00a0are supposed to receive special consideration\u00a0during deportation hearings, but the\u00a0guidelines are inconsistently applied. However, some\u00a0of these veterans have\u00a0spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses, which makes their situation more difficult to parse, at least politically. Elected officials (and\u00a0candidates) who might ordinarily be in full-throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers. Sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the American flag\u00a0suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before. Miguel Perez, a United States Army veteran, falls under that category. The 39-year-old Illinois man, who served two tours in Afghanistan and who has been in the U.S. since he was eight, was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008. The green card holder had served half of a 15-year prison sentence when Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement took him for deportation proceedings. After losing an appeal, Perez was deported in March 2018: Perez was flown from Gary, Indiana, to Brownsville, Texas, where officers escorted him across the border and turned him over to Mexican authorities, ICE officials said. Perez appeared shocked by his treatment during his final moments on U.S. soil. An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would \u201cfix this\u201d while leading him to a gate, Perez said. \u201cWhen we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done here,'\u201d he said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally? This is it?\u201d The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to\u00a0return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don\u2019t apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes.

Roche\u2019s announcement on Friday follows others including U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Co, Italy\u2019s DiaSorin that aim to develop and sell tests to identify antibodies. \u201cThis is the working assumption: If you test and find people that have developed these antibodies, then at least for a certain period of time they will have gained immunity,\u201d Thomas Schinecker, Roche\u2019s diagnostics head, said. \u201cWe worked day and night on this, over weekends, to make sure we can help as many patients as possible,\u201d Schinecker told Reuters. The Basel-based company pledged to make its antibody test available by early May in countries that accept European CE regulatory standards, and is seeking Food and Drug Administration emergency authorisation for U.S. use. It plans by June to boost production to \u201chigh double-digit millions\u201d per month, with the tests due to be run on more than 40,000 of Roche\u2019s cobas e testing machines installed worldwide. The test identifies antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the body, suggesting possible immunity. Countries have various plans to use such tests to better understand the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus, while also identifying those who were infected but showed only mild symptoms, or none at all. Diasorin SpA of Italy is among those developing an antibody test which it hopes to put to use this month. Chief Executive Carlo Rosa told Reuters last week that demand is immense, a situation that parallels the global scramble for ventilators to keep critically ill patients alive. \u201cWe won\u2019t be in a position to respond to the enormous demand that there will be for these tests on our own,\u201d said Rosa, adding Diasorin has 5,000 testing platforms installed globally, including 500 in Italy, which can process 170 samples an hour. Authorities in the Italian regions of Veneto and Emilia Romagna have already begun testing health workers and authorities in hard-hit Lombardy where thousands have died are planning an antibody screening from April 21. Finland, Germany, Britain and other countries have antibody testing plans, too, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using them to study community-wide transmission. It is not yet clear how conflicting demands from governments and businesses will be managed. Amazon.com has voiced interest in testing, but in Spain, the purchase by Siemens wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA of 2,000 assays to test employees, prompted the Spanish government to requisition the tests, union leaders said. In Roche\u2019s home country of Switzerland, officials are examining antibody tests in trials underway in Geneva\u2019s university hospital, while still warning that too little is known about the new coronavirus to conclude a positive test offers conclusive evidence of immunity. \u201cWhat you can\u2019t say, and that\u2019s this idea that\u2019s going around, is that if I have the antibodies, then I know if I\u2019m immune or not,\u201d said Patrick Mathys, the Swiss health ministry\u2019s crisis management head. That will take more research. A spokesman for the ministry said antibody tests are foreseen playing a role for future steps to lift the country\u2019s restrictions like bans on group gatherings and school closures. For now, the Swiss government is basing its decision to start easing curbs on April 27 on slowing rates of new infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Before antibodies play a role, \u201cfirst we\u2019ve got to have validated tests,\u201d the spokesman said. Even tests with high accuracy have weaknesses, potentially producing thousands of false positive results. False positives could lead someone to believe they have immunity when in fact they have none. Roche\u2019s tests have met the company\u2019s accuracy expectations, Schinecker said, though it is not yet releasing data. \u201cWe put our best scientists on this,\u201d Schinecker said. \u201cWhat we see is that the way we\u2019ve designed the assay, it\u2019s extremely specific.\u201d","sources":" ","label":0,"subjects":"Health News","__index_level_0__":8089,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nGovernments and businesses are seeking out such tests, to help them craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies even though it is not yet certain if those infected develop immunity to the new virus as with many other illnesses.

A spokesman for the ministry said antibody tests are foreseen playing a role for future steps to lift the country\u2019s restrictions like bans on group gatherings and school closures. For now, the Swiss government is basing its decision to start easing curbs on April 27 on slowing rates of new infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Before antibodies play a role, \u201cfirst we\u2019ve got to have validated tests,\u201d the spokesman said. Even tests with high accuracy have weaknesses, potentially producing thousands of false positive results. False positives could lead someone to believe they have immunity when in fact they have none. Roche\u2019s tests have met the company\u2019s accuracy expectations, Schinecker said, though it is not yet releasing data. \u201cWe put our best scientists on this,\u201d Schinecker said. \u201cWhat we see is that the way we\u2019ve designed the assay, it\u2019s extremely specific.\u201dn\nClaim: Switzerland's Roche joins global race to make coronavirus antibody tests.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim is true. The evidence provided clearly states that Roche is indeed joining the global race to make coronavirus antibody tests. Roche's diagnostics head, Thomas Schinecker, mentioned that they worked on developing these tests day and night and are planning to make them available by early May. Additionally, the evidence mentions Roche's plans to boost production and seek FDA emergency authorization for U.S. use. Therefore, the claim is true."}

{"claim_id":11422,"hypothesis":"New HPV vaccine offers greater protection against cervical cancer than current vaccine","date_published":"May 8, 2015","explanation_1":"This news release has several strengths. It carefully describes an important study comparing two forms of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and provides the reader with information on the potential impact of HPV infections. However, it doesn\u2019t deliver fully on several of our other criteria including costs, quantification of benefits, and harms. We also think that it is important from a public health perspective to discuss use of the vaccine in the context of screening programs for cervical cancer (e.g. Pap tests). While the release does mention screening, it does so only in passing. The vaccine can \u00a0greatly reduce the risk that immunized girls will develop cervical cancer in the future, but it cannot totally eliminate that risk, even when all three doses are administered. In addition, the rates of complete vaccination among eligible girls is not ideal, and a few words about the importance of completion would have added to the release. HPV infection occurs in just about every sexually active adult. In the vast majority of cases, its presence produces no lasting effects. Depending of the strain of virus and other factors, however, the virus can cause a number of genital conditions including genital cancers. A vaccine that lowers risk when administered prior to sexual activity in girls is a significant step toward reducing the burden of the disease. This release highlights the results of a study that compared two forms of the vaccine that target different HPV subtypes.","fact_checkers":"Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kevin Lomangino","premise":"The release is from the UK and likely written for a UK audience, which would expect the cost of the vaccine to be covered under the NHS vaccination program. (The release mentions that the current vaccine is covered by NHS.) However, the release does not provide any detail on what the vaccine costs per person or what the vaccination program costs NHS \u2014 which is something we think even readers in the UK would be interested in and deserve to know. For our U.S. readers, we\u2019d note that\u00a0the vaccine requires three doses and therefore three different office visits. The costs of the visits and the vaccines ($130-140 per dose) bring the total immunization cost to approximately $500. Insurance usually covers a portion of the costs, but patients may have copayments. The release headline says the new version of the vaccine is \u201cbetter\u201d than the existing version, and the study backs this up. As the release notes, \u201c\u0085Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\u201d But while \u201c97 percent effective\u201d sounds very impressive, what exactly does that mean? \u201c97 percent effective\u201d compared with what? The study published in the NEJM has the statistics that can put this into perspective. The paper notes the exact rate of disease that was observed in both the old and new vaccine groups: \u201cThe rate of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to [various HPV subtypes] \u2026 was 0.1 per 1000 person-years in the 9vHPV [new vaccine] group and 1.6 per 1000 person-years in the qHPV [existing vaccine] group.\u201d \u00a0For a more reader-friendly description, the release could have said the rates were 0.1 vs. 1.6 cases per thousand people in the study annually. In addition, the accompanying editorial in the NEJM rightly points to the less than spectacular successes to date in actually immunizing young and adolescent girls with three doses over 6 months. \u201cAt 57%, coverage for the first dose of HPV vaccination among girls 13 to 17 years of age lags behind coverage for other vaccines recommended for children 11 to 12 years of age by approximately 20 to 25 percentage points.\u201d Greater emphasis on the need to follow through with all three doses would have been welcome. The only mention of potential harms from the new vaccine come from a study author who says, \u201cThis is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers.\u201d \u00a0Indeed, the vaccine appears to be safe, but we think that a complete disclosure of the adverse events observed in the study would have been helpful. The conclusion in the research notes, \u201cAdverse events related to injection site were more common in the 9vHPV group than in the qHPV group.\u201d So yes, the vaccine is safe, but appears to have more issues at the injection site than the existing vaccines. This is important because not all girls carry through with all three vaccinations; the lack of follow-through may be related to pain on injection. The release notes that the vaccine has been approved by the US FDA on the basis of the study being reported on. It also provides some information about the study itself, noting that it was a \u201cclinical trial [comparing] the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. \u201d Ideally we should have been told it was a randomized double blind study and the study duration was 6 months. Some detail about the demographics of the women in the study would also have been helpful. However, we think the release provides enough information for readers to be assured of the study\u2019s overall quality. The release doesn\u2019t exaggerate the burden of HPV infection or cervical cancer. In fact, we think the release could have done more to create urgency around the need to vaccinate. The release points out that the study was funded by the manufacturer of the vaccine and that Dr. Cuzick was a coauthor of the study. The release does point out that there are two older vaccines that are available. It notes that\u00a0the quadrivalent vaccine protects against 4 strains of HPV, offering about 70 percent protection against cervical cancer, whereas the 9-valent vaccine protects against 9 strains and can prevent up to 90 percent of all cervical cancers. The release also mentions in passing that the vaccine can be discussed as part of a screening program in women ages 25 to 45. We feel that the release could have emphasized this more. The release makes it clear that the new vaccine is available in the US but not yet in the UK. The release makes it clear that the study is the first of its kind comparing two types of HPV vaccine. Quotes from Dr. Cuzik are enthusiastic but could not be described as unjustified. He says, \u201cThis is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019d add that while his statement may be accurate, the promise of the vaccine will only be achieved with higher vaccination rates","sources":"http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMoa1405044","label":0,"subjects":"Academic medical center news release,Cancer","__index_level_0__":8988,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThe release is from the UK and likely written for a UK audience, which would expect the cost of the vaccine to be covered under the NHS vaccination program.

The conclusion in the research notes, \u201cAdverse events related to injection site were more common in the 9vHPV group than in the qHPV group.\u201d So yes, the vaccine is safe, but appears to have more issues at the injection site than the existing vaccines. This is important because not all girls carry through with all three vaccinations; the lack of follow-through may be related to pain on injection. The release notes that the vaccine has been approved by the US FDA on the basis of the study being reported on. It also provides some information about the study itself, noting that it was a \u201cclinical trial [comparing] the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. \u201d Ideally we should have been told it was a randomized double blind study and the study duration was 6 months. Some detail about the demographics of the women in the study would also have been helpful. However, we think the release provides enough information for readers to be assured of the study\u2019s overall quality. The release doesn\u2019t exaggerate the burden of HPV infection or cervical cancer. In fact, we think the release could have done more to create urgency around the need to vaccinate. The release points out that the study was funded by the manufacturer of the vaccine and that Dr. Cuzick was a coauthor of the study. The release does point out that there are two older vaccines that are available. It notes that\u00a0the quadrivalent vaccine protects against 4 strains of HPV, offering about 70 percent protection against cervical cancer, whereas the 9-valent vaccine protects against 9 strains and can prevent up to 90 percent of all cervical cancers. The release also mentions in passing that the vaccine can be discussed as part of a screening program in women ages 25 to 45. We feel that the release could have emphasized this more. The release makes it clear that the new vaccine is available in the US but not yet in the UK. The release makes it clear that the study is the first of its kind comparing two types of HPV vaccine. Quotes from Dr. Cuzik are enthusiastic but could not be described as unjustified. He says, \u201cThis is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019d add that while his statement may be accurate, the promise of the vaccine will only be achieved with higher vaccination ratesn\nClaim: New HPV vaccine offers greater protection against cervical cancer than current vaccine\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim is true based on the evidence provided. The release mentions that the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, was 97% effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal disease caused by certain strains of HPV, which is higher than the existing Gardasil vaccine. Additionally, it is stated that the 9-valent vaccine can prevent up to 90 percent of all cervical cancers, compared to about 70 percent protection offered by the quadrivalent vaccine. Therefore, the evidence supports the claim that the new HPV vaccine offers greater protection against cervical cancer than the current vaccine."}

In that explanation, \u201cgun\u201d refers to \u201csoldier\u201d (equating arms with the man, as it were), making any soldier\u2019s or sailor\u2019s male child \u2014 conceived in wedlock or not \u2014 a \u201cson of a gun.\u201d Alliteration (repetition of sounds) and well-cadenced rhymes were just as well-loved centuries ago as they are now, thus our forefathers would have delighted in \u201cson of a gun\u2019s\u201d inherent ear appeal in the same way we were slyly pleased by \u201cthe Thrilla in Manila\u201d and \u201cin like Flynn.\u201d","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"The faintly derogative epithet \u201cson of a gun\u201d has been documented as part of the lexicon of the English language since 1708, but no one can really lay claim to knowing how it began or what the phrase originally signified. Numerous interesting backstories have emerged in the centuries since, and it\u2019s possible one might even be the right one, but we no longer have any way of knowing. We can, however, dismiss some of the more fanciful \u201cexplanations\u201d that have come along: We can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above. First, wives and girlfriends (i.e., prostitutes) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time. Can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships, and how many extra rations they\u2019d have had to carry, if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along? And where did these women stay? There was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew (even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once), and women couldn\u2019t be out on deck where they\u2019d interfere with the operation of the ship. Were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time? Yes, some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives, but this happened infrequently at best, making the presence of non-passenger females (pregnant or otherwise) aboard sailing ships unusual. The vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard, thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women\u2019s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed. (Larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck. This is where the crew on such ships would sleep, not amidst the guns on the gun deck.) Second, we should look askance at the claim that when in port, and with the crew restricted to the ship, women typically gave birth aboard ship. Crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports, which we can fairly assume their home berths were not. And even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew (either to desertion or drunkenness) if they were let off the ship, the wives were under no such restrictions. Not being necessary to the running of the ship, nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth. Their husbands not only wouldn\u2019t accompany this hypothetical exodus, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to even if they could. In the era of sailing ships, the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now \u2014 dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on, but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere, and the farther away the better. Bringing babies into the world was considered wholly the province of women (doctors were summoned only if matters had taken a decidedly bad turn, and even then only rarely), and men were present at such events only when it could not otherwise be avoided. Men certainly did not voluntarily insert themselves into the proceedings, nor would their presence have been welcomed by the women straining to bring children into the world, the midwives attending them, and the array of female relatives that inevitably gathered by the bedside. Third, although a certain convoluted train of logic might tie the firing of large guns to hastening a difficult birth (e.g., inspiration by example, a cornerstone of sympathetic magic), there\u2019s no reason to believe anyone living in those times even tried this, let alone that the practice was so widespread that the firing of guns to ease childbirth begat a distinct phrase. Histories of life in the 1700s and 1800s are thunderous in their silence about this practice, and it can safely be assumed that quiet reflects a stunning truth about the matter \u2014 that whatever tales we\u2019re now telling ourselves, cannonfire wasn\u2019t being used to hasten babies into the world. Granted, gunfire had been employed in distant times to fend off disease (it never worked), so there is some historical basis for a tie between the discharge of firearms and medical emergencies. During the 1793 yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia, many took to firing muskets both in the street and indoors under the mistaken assumption that introducing the acrid fumes of burnt gunpowder into the air would kill off the mysterious illness daily making away with hundreds of citizens. Such practice was even recommended by the city\u2019s government, so this wasn\u2019t even a case of a few badly-educated members of the populace seizing upon a fanciful notion; at the time it appeared to have the backing of the scientific community. However, it was the fumes of the spent gunpowder, not the report of the guns, that was supposed to effect the cure. In the realm of superstition, sudden noise is espoused as a way to drive away evil (we toll wedding bells for this purpose, and the New Year\u2019s Eve hullabaloo springs from that same wellspring of belief), but there is only one reported tie in that area of study between abrupt racket and the induction of labor, and it involves the ringing of church bells. Rather, the canon of superstition advises the loosening and opening of items to assist during a difficult childbirth: windows are to be flung open, doors unlocked, and shoelaces undone to help the impending mother in her travails. Nothing in superstition, however, advises frightening women into giving birth, much less introducing roaring cannons into the procedure. Another explanation for \u201cson of a gun\u201d ties the phrase to the reason for shotgun weddings \u2014 the child of such unions was deemed a \u201cson of the gun.\u201d That might seem a more reasonable origin, but that meaning did not appear in connection to the term until 1922.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Language, folk etymology, Phrase Craze, son of a gun","__index_level_0__":1596,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThe faintly derogative epithet \u201cson of a gun\u201d has been documented as part of the lexicon of the English language since 1708, but no one can really lay claim to knowing how it began or what the phrase originally signified.

Such practice was even recommended by the city\u2019s government, so this wasn\u2019t even a case of a few badly-educated members of the populace seizing upon a fanciful notion; at the time it appeared to have the backing of the scientific community. However, it was the fumes of the spent gunpowder, not the report of the guns, that was supposed to effect the cure. In the realm of superstition, sudden noise is espoused as a way to drive away evil (we toll wedding bells for this purpose, and the New Year\u2019s Eve hullabaloo springs from that same wellspring of belief), but there is only one reported tie in that area of study between abrupt racket and the induction of labor, and it involves the ringing of church bells. Rather, the canon of superstition advises the loosening and opening of items to assist during a difficult childbirth: windows are to be flung open, doors unlocked, and shoelaces undone to help the impending mother in her travails. Nothing in superstition, however, advises frightening women into giving birth, much less introducing roaring cannons into the procedure. Another explanation for \u201cson of a gun\u201d ties the phrase to the reason for shotgun weddings \u2014 the child of such unions was deemed a \u201cson of the gun.\u201d That might seem a more reasonable origin, but that meaning did not appear in connection to the term until 1922.n\nClaim: \"Disputed parentage of a child born aboard a ship was resolved by listing the newborn as a \"\"son of the gun.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Not enough information.

{"claim_id":39172,"hypothesis":" Wheat is toxic because farmers   routinely apply Roundup to crops days before harvest to dry down or kill   the plants. \u00a0    ","date_published":"March 17, 2015","explanation_1":"The Real Reason Wheat is Toxic ","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"The theory that Roundup makes wheat toxic is   yet another unproven attempt to explain why more and more people are   suffering from wheat intolerance. The eRumor   first appeared in a   blog published by   the Healthy Home Economist in November 2014. The post claims that   farmers who treat crops with Roundup days before harvest are to blame   for wheat intolerance, which is also referred to as celiac disease or a   gluten allergy. The post,   which was quickly shared more than 560,000 times on Facebook, states:  \u201cWheat harvest protocol in the United States is to   drench the wheat fields with Roundup several days before the combine   harvesters work through the fields as withered, dead wheat plants are   less taxing on the farm equipment and allows for an earlier, easier and   bigger harvest.\u201d It\u2019s true   that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, can be applied to   wheat before harvest in a process known as \u201cdesiccation.\u201d However, it\u2019s   not clear how often desiccation is used. According to   the   University of Minnesota Extension:\u00a0  \u201cResearch has shown that glyphosate applied with   or without ammonium sulfate may hasten dry down of the wheat crop if   conditions for dry down are adverse. With a pre-harvest interval of   seven days, a couple of days at the most, may be gained.\u201d The use of   desiccation \u201chas increased steadily,\u201d but there\u2019s still not enough   experimental data to determine desiccation\u2019s impact on wheat and seed   quality, the Journal of Seed Science\u00a0reports. Those claims often cite   USDA statistics that report 98 percent of spring wheat, 99 percent of durum wheat and 61   percent of winter wheat was treated with glyphosate in 2012. However,   those statistics don\u2019t tell us how often wheat was treated days before   harvest \u2014 only what percentage was treated at some point in the crop\u2019s   lifecycle. TruthorFiction.com reached out to the   National Association of Wheat Growers for comment on the prevalence of   desiccation. Future updates will be posted here. It is true,   however, that glyphosate has become the most widely used herbicide on   food crops. Anywhere from 13 to 20 million acres of crops are treated   with 18.7 million gallons of it each year, the   EPA says. The eRumor\u2019s   claim that glyphosate causes wheat intolerance is also proven. A 2009   study on   glyphosate\u2019s impact on freshwater fish is regularly cited when health   claims are made about glyphosate. The study found that glyphosate   created \u201csevere pathological lesions\u201d and \u201cmicroridges\u201d in the digestive   tracts of fish. That rendered them unable to \u201clubricate ingested food\u201d   or to \u201cwithstand trauma resulting from ingested material.\u201d A   scientific paper published in 2013 called for additional research to determine whether or   not glyphosate has the same impact on human digestive systems because   its effects would be similar to celiac disease. The   researchers concluded:\u00a0  \u201cThe monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and   in human urine and blood has been inadequate. The common practice of   desiccation and\/or ripening with glyhposate right before the harvest   ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply \u2026 We   urge governments globally to reexamine their policy towards glyphosate   and to introduce new legislation that would restrict its usage.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s no   doubt that wheat intolerance is on the rise. The Mayo Clinic   estimates that   four times more people are affected by it today than in the 1950s. The   only question is why it has been on the rise, and researchers   don\u2019t have a definitive answer. Dr. Chella   David, a geneticist and immunologist at Mayo,   says it could be   caused by immune systems turning on themselves because our environments   are so sterile that they have nothing else to attack. He says   differences in the ways wheat is processed and eaten could be a factor   as well. \u201cMany of the   processed foods we eat were not in existence 50 years ago,\u201d David says. A number of   theories exist to explain why more and more people can\u2019t eat gluten, and   the only clear answer is that more research is needed to find the true   cause.

The post claims that   farmers who treat crops with Roundup days before harvest are to blame   for wheat intolerance, which is also referred to as celiac disease or a   gluten allergy. The post,   which was quickly shared more than 560,000 times on Facebook, states:  \u201cWheat harvest protocol in the United States is to   drench the wheat fields with Roundup several days before the combine   harvesters work through the fields as withered, dead wheat plants are   less taxing on the farm equipment and allows for an earlier, easier and   bigger harvest.\u201d It\u2019s true   that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, can be applied to   wheat before harvest in a process known as \u201cdesiccation.\u201d However, it\u2019s   not clear how often desiccation is used. According to   the   University of Minnesota Extension:\u00a0  \u201cResearch has shown that glyphosate applied with   or without ammonium sulfate may hasten dry down of the wheat crop if   conditions for dry down are adverse. With a pre-harvest interval of   seven days, a couple of days at the most, may be gained.\u201d The use of   desiccation \u201chas increased steadily,\u201d but there\u2019s still not enough   experimental data to determine desiccation\u2019s impact on wheat and seed   quality, the Journal of Seed Science\u00a0reports. Those claims often cite   USDA statistics that report 98 percent of spring wheat, 99 percent of durum wheat and 61   percent of winter wheat was treated with glyphosate in 2012. However,   those statistics don\u2019t tell us how often wheat was treated days before   harvest \u2014 only what percentage was treated at some point in the crop\u2019s   lifecycle. TruthorFiction.com reached out to the   National Association of Wheat Growers for comment on the prevalence of   desiccation. Future updates will be posted here. It is true,   however, that glyphosate has become the most widely used herbicide on   food crops. Anywhere from 13 to 20 million acres of crops are treated   with 18.7 million gallons of it each year, the   EPA says. The eRumor\u2019s   claim that glyphosate causes wheat intolerance is also proven. A 2009   study on   glyphosate\u2019s impact on freshwater fish is regularly cited when health   claims are made about glyphosate. The study found that glyphosate   created \u201csevere pathological lesions\u201d and \u201cmicroridges\u201d in the digestive   tracts of fish. That rendered them unable to \u201clubricate ingested food\u201d   or to \u201cwithstand trauma resulting from ingested material.\u201d A   scientific paper published in 2013 called for additional research to determine whether or   not glyphosate has the same impact on human digestive systems because   its effects would be similar to celiac disease. The   researchers concluded:\u00a0  \u201cThe monitoring of glyphosate levels in food and   in human urine and blood has been inadequate. The common practice of   desiccation and\/or ripening with glyhposate right before the harvest   ensures that glyphosate residues are present in our food supply \u2026 We   urge governments globally to reexamine their policy towards glyphosate   and to introduce new legislation that would restrict its usage.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s no   doubt that wheat intolerance is on the rise. The Mayo Clinic   estimates that   four times more people are affected by it today than in the 1950s. The   only question is why it has been on the rise, and researchers   don\u2019t have a definitive answer. Dr. Chella   David, a geneticist and immunologist at Mayo,   says it could be   caused by immune systems turning on themselves because our environments   are so sterile that they have nothing else to attack. He says   differences in the ways wheat is processed and eaten could be a factor   as well. \u201cMany of the   processed foods we eat were not in existence 50 years ago,\u201d David says. A number of   theories exist to explain why more and more people can\u2019t eat gluten, and   the only clear answer is that more research is needed to find the true   cause. Posted  11\/14\/14   Commentsn\nClaim:  Wheat is toxic because farmers   routinely apply Roundup to crops days before harvest to dry down or kill   the plants. \u00a0    \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that wheat is toxic because farmers apply Roundup to crops days before harvest is not enough information. While it is true that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, can be applied to wheat before harvest, there is not enough experimental data to determine the impact of this practice on wheat and seed quality. Additionally, researchers are still trying to determine the cause of the rise in wheat intolerance, so it cannot be definitively stated that Roundup application is the reason for the toxicity of wheat. Therefore, the claim is not enough information."}

It is a severe reaction to one of the ingredients (unknown which) in this product. I\u2019ve received hundreds of messages from people who have endured the exact same thing (especially since November\/December) from various Blue Buffalo products \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\udc95I\u2019ve added a few screenshots of other people\u2019s stories with permission****I can\u2019t add them all there are so many \ud83d\ude1eMcDonald\u2019s original post appeared to be the portion below, and started with describing how she purchased Blue Buffalo Dental Bones on January 4 2020 at a PetSmart location. She stated she gave Dallas one of the bones on the night of January 4 2020, adding that her pet vomited blood overnight.After watchful waiting, Dallas\u2019 condition purportedly deteriorated and he was transported to a veterinarian for additional testing:OP\u2014>Don\u2019t buy this shit. I grabbed these at Pets Mart on Saturday thinking Blue Buffalo $40 dental \u201cbones\u201d would be good stuff (heathy, holistic, wheat free, no chemical dye) for a bit of tartar buildup. My dog Dallas had one yesterday evening (we supervised him and he chewed it up). Sometime overnight he started throwing up blood ( total was 14-18 times before the vet got it under control with meds). I initially wrote it off to a bit of gastro upset and the red in his vomit to the dehydrated beets in it. But he wouldn\u2019t eat chicken and rice and couldn\u2019t even keep water down. Then he started drooling and dragging his feet and then couldn\u2019t even stand.Needless to say we rushed him to the vet. When I looked up this brand I was shocked to find similar experiences posted online, especially in the last few weeks.He tested negative for pancreatitis. X-ray showed no obstruction (which we were fairly positive of even beforehand seeing as we watched him eat it) but it showed that his stomach is super irritated and pancreas was a bit off too. Bloodwork is all wonky cause his RBC is so high from dehydration.At that point, McDonald noted that the veterinarian\u2019s tests were inconclusive \u2014 her conclusion that Blue Buffalo Dental Bones had caused Dallas\u2019 idiopathic illness was based on information she obtained by searching on Google for complaints about that specific product. McDonald said that Dallas was infrequently ill and rarely had stomach problems, that she supervised his consumption of the Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and that she located several similar complaints from owners whose dogs had fallen ill after consuming the same product:He\u2019s staying overnight at the vet on IV fluids. Endoscopy showed a lot of damage in his stomach, too much for surgery. We will know more tomorrow. This has been a nightmare \ud83d\udc94 feels so wrong being at home without my dog and I\u2019m beating myself up for not doing my research first like I usually do \ud83d\ude25I\u2019m sharing because;1. This guy has an iron stomach and usually nothing gets to him. 5 yo and NEVER had any previous health issues or food allergies \u2639\ufe0f2. He ate ONE and it was supervised, he broke it down and consumed it properly3. If you google this brand there are eerily similar complaints especially in the last few weeks. Diagnoses I keep seeing are pancreatitis and HGE.If it saves even one person the heartache we are enduring right now then it\u2019s worth it. A higher price doesn\u2019t mean better quality or safe!ETA: If you can\u2019t share my post you might have to click the original post. It is shareable on my wall but some page settings have sharing turned off.According to McDonald, the diagnoses mentioned by other distressed dog owners were pancreatitis and HGE, presumably \u201chemorrhagic gastroenteritis.\u201d McDonald also updated to include additional anecdotal reports from dog owners whose pets became ill or died in a similar fashion. Those commenters also believed that their pets were sickened by Blue Buffalo Dental Bones (or possibly other Blue Buffalo products. )We checked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) animal\/veterinary recalls site for any complaints involving Blue Buffalo Dental Bones; the only result related to Blue Buffalo on a whole involved a 2017 voluntary recall of \u201cone production lot of BLUE Wilderness\u00ae Rocky Mountain RecipeTM Red Meat Dinner Wet Food for Adult Dogs, as the product has the potential to contain elevated levels of naturally-occurring beef thyroid hormones.\u201dThat release described a specific \u201clot\u201d of one variety of canned dog food, and a completely different and unrelated risk posed by that voluntarily recalled product:Dogs ingesting high levels of beef thyroid hormones may exhibit symptoms such as increased thirst and urination, weight loss, increased heart rate and restlessness. These symptoms may resolve when the use of the impacted food is discontinued. However, with prolonged consumption these symptoms may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or difficulty breathing. Should these symptoms occur, contact your veterinarian immediately.According to the release, it appeared that illness in one dog \u2014 not a large number, as the Facebook post implied about Blue Buffalo\u2019s Dental Bones \u2014 triggered the widespread recall. In that instance, the FDA and Blue Buffalo monitored the case, and the dog made a full recovery:Although the Blue Buffalo Customer Care Resource Team has not received any reports of dogs exhibiting these symptoms from consuming this product, the FDA advised Blue Buffalo of a single consumer who reported symptoms in one dog, who has now fully recovered. Blue Buffalo immediately began an investigation, however, and after working with the FDA, Blue Buffalo decided it would be prudent to recall the one production lot in question.An absence of reports was not due to the FDA not logging reports like the one in the Facebook post. On page 10 of 12 unlabeled consumer reports, a separate brand of dental bones were cited by a consumer as the cause of her dog\u2019s euthanization. Unlike the dog in the Facebook post, that pet had consumed many of the dental bones over a long period before falling ill:My dog began vomiting at around 7:00pm on Monday, February 4, 2013. He continued to vomit throughout the night, at least once per hour. He became very lethargic and would cry out in pain if touched. I took him to the vet the next morning when he had not improved. He was on IV fluids all day and put out < 2cc of urine, and that urine was mostly blood. The blood tests revealed that he was in complete renal failure. The veterinarian told me that he would die within 24 hours due to his complete loss of kidney function, and that my best option was to have him euthanized because he was in pain and would continue to get worse as death grew closer. Prior to this, he was a happy and healthy indoor dog. He was playful and loving, and I took care of him as if he were my child. He was on a diet of Blue Buffalo Brown Rice and Lamb formula, and he was not allowed any table scraps or other foods. I recently began feeding him \u201cDingo Dental Bones For Total Care Minis\u201d at a rate of about one bone per day or every other day. This is the only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.In the consumer-submitted report, the dog\u2019s owner described a dental bones brand separate from Blue Buffalo as \u201cthe only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.\u201d That descriptor alluded to the difficulty in pinpointing sudden and severe illness in a beloved pet, particularly dogs.More to the point, the majority of pet owner reports involving a pet\u2019s meals in the day or days before the pet fell ill were likely to include one or more prominent national brands, of which Blue Buffalo was one. Dogs could consume any number of non-food items before falling ill in the night, and the pet\u2019s owner would recall having given their pet Purina, Alpo, or Blue Buffalo just prior to their sudden illness. In that respect, narrowing down the cause of illness would be perpetually likely to involve a major brand of pet food consumed the day before the pet fell ill or died.McDonald appended several screenshots of messages to her post, which had roughly thirty images in total. Of all the times readers shared this post, that indicated that perhaps one or two dozen users contacted her with suspicions about the safety of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones or other Blue Buffalo products.The two messages visible on McDonald\u2019s main post involved complaints about dog food, but not Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. The first complaint was from a woman who urged fellow dog owners not to feed their pets Blue Buffalo brand dog food, not chews. The second was even more vague, albeit heartbreaking, containing a woman\u2019s claim that she switched her dog to Blue Buffalo \u201ca few months\u201d prior to the dog\u2019s death due to unspecified causes \u2014 not due to dental bones, nor specifically something like pancreatitis or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.It is important to remember that Blue Buffalo and similarly prominent pet food brands are fed to millions of pets in the United States on a daily basis. Pets who fall ill or die suddenly are extremely likely to have eaten a brand\u2019s pet food due to their ubiquity and necessity alone. Pets are also unable to provide their owners with information about their illnesses or diets, leading heartbroken \u201cpet parents\u201d to attempt to piece together a definitive account of what sickened their dog or cat. In these examinations, a prominent brand of pet food is almost always likely to be on the list.Brand-related pet panics typically seem to center at least first around food, an issue addressed during a different panic in 2013. During that investigation, veterinarian Dr. Stephen Ettinger noted that \u201cit is rare that their food is responsible for the illness.\u201dEttinger further pointed out that anecdotal claims often take center stage when consumers feared danger in pet products:\u201cWhen a pet is sick, pet owners often look first to the pet\u2019s food as the cause. However, it is rare that their food is responsible for the illness,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ettinger in an article published by DVM360.com, a trade publication for veterinarians. Ettinger, an academic veterinarian at Cornell University, recently commented in a ConsumerAffairs story about similar complaints involving Beneful dog food.\u201cThese statements (the consumer postings) are not backed by any scientific studies, and the conditions described in the postings are amongst the most common conditions seen in everyday veterinary practice,\u201d said Ettinger said after reviewing many of the posted Beneful reports.Veterinary hospital organization VCA Hospitals maintained a page\u00a0about hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, explaining the condition and citing \u201cdietary indiscretion\u201d as a primary cause:Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) (also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [HGE]) is an acute (sudden) disorder of dogs characterized by vomiting and bloody diarrhea. Most cases occur without warning in otherwise healthy dogs. The main and most disturbing clinical sign is large amounts of bloody diarrhea, very often bright red. Some dogs may have a painful abdomen, decreased appetite, lethargy (fatigue), or fever. [\u2026]What causes AHDS? The exact cause of AHDS remains unknown (idiopathic). It may be related to dietary indiscretion (ingesting non-food items or different foods), immune-mediated disease, toxins, or pancreatitis. Stress, anxiety, and hyperactivity are thought to be possible contributing factors in many cases.On January 6 2020, Blue Buffalo specifically acknowledged the viral Blue Buffalo Dental Bones complaint on Facebook, writing:We\u2019ve heard from many of you on the recent social posts regarding our BLUE Dental Bones. As pet parents ourselves, there is nothing we hate more than hearing of a sick pet. Thank you for reaching out and showing your concern.We\u2019ve contacted this pet parent to learn more about their pup\u2019s recent health issue and would like to assure our loyal BLUE customers that our BLUE Dental Bones undergo significant quality and digestibility testing to ensure we provide the safest and healthiest product possible. We take all customer complaints very seriously and will continue to investigate this issue.Many of the top comments came from pet owners lodging complaints about their dogs\u2019 illnesses and Blue Buffalo products. The top comment was from a user who did not mention Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, but rather \u201cproduct\u201d:Our healthy 2 year old dog spent days in the er with hemmoragic gastronitis on the 22nd after eating your products as well. Many many dogs are all having the same symptoms. All at the same time all with you being the common denominator. We are getting our food and treats tested. We will never use your products again and are warning everyone we can to never use your products! You are making dogs sick and some are dying horrible deaths!Other users referenced a completely separate set of anecdotes (regarding reported heart problems in dogs), and several commenters left well wishes for Dallas while also adding that their dogs were healthy users of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. A second commenter also referenced what appeared to be kibble, not dental bones:Now we are another customer that just got back from the vet with a dog diagnoses of pancreatitis and a very hefty bill after opening a brand new bag Sunday morning. Luckily he only ate that one meal and then threw it up within the hour and hasn\u2019t had a bite since. We thought we might loose him. Hopefully our wallet will keep him alive because you\u2019re food wants otherwise.One person relayed a story of a different product being blamed for heart issues in humans, a product purportedly vindicated after a viral controversy. And a third shared a story of a recently deceased pet, referencing similar symptoms but not any specific mechanism or product:Alarming that your dog food and treats are still on shelves. My 5 year old completely healthy fur baby showed the same symptoms on the 23rd of December, took her to the vet and she passed away on Christmas. I will never buy a single product of yours again, and I will make sure everyone I know with fur babies is aware of these incidents and hopefully will also stay away from your products.A fourth person confidently claimed that 99 percent of veterinarians do not recommend Blue Buffalo. When asked to back up that assertion, the commenter said that they were \u201cjust repeating what they heard\u201d from a single veterinarian.A highly viral January 2020 claim was one of several Facebook pet-related safety warnings, urging dog owners to steer clear of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones due to the purported grave illness of one individual dog and based on a distressed owner\u2019s Google searching. A handful of fellow dog owners came forward to report similar suspicions, but many of their shared stories involved either different health conditions or different Blue Buffalo products. The Food and Drug Administration had no information regarding a safety risk with Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and its only result among recalls was a voluntary one based on the symptoms of one dog that later recovered. Although it remained possible Blue Buffalo Dental Bones were causing illness and death, the claim was difficult to narrow down due in part to the fact most dogs are fed commercially produced dog food from a handful of national brands \u2014 including Blue Buffalo.Correction: A previous version of this story had the date of the original post as January 5 2019, not January 5 2020. We apologize for the error. -bb","sources":"https:\/\/www.consumeraffairs.com\/news\/pet-owners-blame-blue-buffalo-for-their-animals-illnesses-fda-expresses-concern-about-continuing-pet-food-issues-031213.html, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27Blue+Buffalo+Dental+Bones+Hemorrhagic+Gastritis%27+Facebook+Warning&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nikki.barker.589\/posts\/10107255556628432, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BlueBuffalo\/posts\/10156824120223359?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDOiym_N9pBBgingk2Glz25BYSjlYwwAxznqlxL_u9IjjKntbUvCzQYhnijK_IGGLyZQDrZod92dG7QbXeU8S4jus9EqloDmCKrJEYW1ji895DjC5tULZcsQq-m4MBON7FqZSDxfb7iXQjJGwfZ1NTyRfrb4dl16rlakfxkpcCEUlAdIdsAngAlXuRYQwLMTf6FtJvUoxc-OnIUZkehQKtbIgNt13pXIcL_8pD7FIXuk7Ohuo9SVO5tpx3Z-kcbAvTUUSTdPx-7jFutsaEUdKTWyhj1lxCS5TYpdJmUTj0x9NQva04SJWMQxjVcn5_5bA_3IncXjgXMmxGM&__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARAWSr919a9dLgEYOXG-gl9oRRXnaEXwLWb5fZTFUXqLfJpp8ZCAg6kgSk124Wq-8Cc9fBFk5wZrfuHwW0SIFkjMoRMXWEak2q2M_IkeSf7GkeLbgq2HhMFN44U_E754Imb_ZxeIXWfzcCPH34hTmf6Zxja5x4zWtfdk_c2XCTGLPqYiKsYt8UfA_WfKXZ4rVjXnfho-hWZF8riunV9xwqHcMJ5R1O6jJdb84BCgD-vKlZdFI39JeePWRxkz6d_rPFUMNhh-s_PojUUmol3sNK5od2-FCHAWzKzwG-YVGd5ZG6Qan_44sQ9CXBU8c5L8-1gjGc6dWWQZUEe6&__tn__=-R, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/animal-veterinary\/safety-health\/recalls-withdrawals, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/were-an-army-veterans-prosthetic-legs-repossessed-after-a-va-and-medicare-dispute\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/safety\/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts\/blue-buffalo-voluntarily-recalls-one-lot-blue-wildernessr-rocky-mountain-recipe-tm-red-meat-dinner, https:\/\/vcahospitals.com\/know-your-pet\/hemorrhagic-gastroenteritis-in-dogs, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/86880\/download, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":1,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1020,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn January 5 2020, Facebook user Nikki McDonald shared the following post about the brand Blue Buffalo\u2019s Dental Bones product, reporting that her dog Dallas was gravely injured and nearly killed after she gave him the product:In under a week, the post was shared hundreds of thousands of times.

When I looked up this brand I was shocked to find similar experiences posted online, especially in the last few weeks.He tested negative for pancreatitis. X-ray showed no obstruction (which we were fairly positive of even beforehand seeing as we watched him eat it) but it showed that his stomach is super irritated and pancreas was a bit off too. Bloodwork is all wonky cause his RBC is so high from dehydration.At that point, McDonald noted that the veterinarian\u2019s tests were inconclusive \u2014 her conclusion that Blue Buffalo Dental Bones had caused Dallas\u2019 idiopathic illness was based on information she obtained by searching on Google for complaints about that specific product. McDonald said that Dallas was infrequently ill and rarely had stomach problems, that she supervised his consumption of the Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and that she located several similar complaints from owners whose dogs had fallen ill after consuming the same product:He\u2019s staying overnight at the vet on IV fluids. Endoscopy showed a lot of damage in his stomach, too much for surgery. We will know more tomorrow. This has been a nightmare \ud83d\udc94 feels so wrong being at home without my dog and I\u2019m beating myself up for not doing my research first like I usually do \ud83d\ude25I\u2019m sharing because;1. This guy has an iron stomach and usually nothing gets to him. 5 yo and NEVER had any previous health issues or food allergies \u2639\ufe0f2. He ate ONE and it was supervised, he broke it down and consumed it properly3. If you google this brand there are eerily similar complaints especially in the last few weeks. Diagnoses I keep seeing are pancreatitis and HGE.If it saves even one person the heartache we are enduring right now then it\u2019s worth it. A higher price doesn\u2019t mean better quality or safe!ETA: If you can\u2019t share my post you might have to click the original post. It is shareable on my wall but some page settings have sharing turned off.According to McDonald, the diagnoses mentioned by other distressed dog owners were pancreatitis and HGE, presumably \u201chemorrhagic gastroenteritis.\u201d McDonald also updated to include additional anecdotal reports from dog owners whose pets became ill or died in a similar fashion. Those commenters also believed that their pets were sickened by Blue Buffalo Dental Bones (or possibly other Blue Buffalo products. )We checked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) animal\/veterinary recalls site for any complaints involving Blue Buffalo Dental Bones; the only result related to Blue Buffalo on a whole involved a 2017 voluntary recall of \u201cone production lot of BLUE Wilderness\u00ae Rocky Mountain RecipeTM Red Meat Dinner Wet Food for Adult Dogs, as the product has the potential to contain elevated levels of naturally-occurring beef thyroid hormones.\u201dThat release described a specific \u201clot\u201d of one variety of canned dog food, and a completely different and unrelated risk posed by that voluntarily recalled product:Dogs ingesting high levels of beef thyroid hormones may exhibit symptoms such as increased thirst and urination, weight loss, increased heart rate and restlessness. These symptoms may resolve when the use of the impacted food is discontinued. However, with prolonged consumption these symptoms may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or difficulty breathing. Should these symptoms occur, contact your veterinarian immediately.According to the release, it appeared that illness in one dog \u2014 not a large number, as the Facebook post implied about Blue Buffalo\u2019s Dental Bones \u2014 triggered the widespread recall. In that instance, the FDA and Blue Buffalo monitored the case, and the dog made a full recovery:Although the Blue Buffalo Customer Care Resource Team has not received any reports of dogs exhibiting these symptoms from consuming this product, the FDA advised Blue Buffalo of a single consumer who reported symptoms in one dog, who has now fully recovered. Blue Buffalo immediately began an investigation, however, and after working with the FDA, Blue Buffalo decided it would be prudent to recall the one production lot in question.An absence of reports was not due to the FDA not logging reports like the one in the Facebook post. On page 10 of 12 unlabeled consumer reports, a separate brand of dental bones were cited by a consumer as the cause of her dog\u2019s euthanization. Unlike the dog in the Facebook post, that pet had consumed many of the dental bones over a long period before falling ill:My dog began vomiting at around 7:00pm on Monday, February 4, 2013. He continued to vomit throughout the night, at least once per hour. He became very lethargic and would cry out in pain if touched. I took him to the vet the next morning when he had not improved. He was on IV fluids all day and put out < 2cc of urine, and that urine was mostly blood. The blood tests revealed that he was in complete renal failure. The veterinarian told me that he would die within 24 hours due to his complete loss of kidney function, and that my best option was to have him euthanized because he was in pain and would continue to get worse as death grew closer. Prior to this, he was a happy and healthy indoor dog. He was playful and loving, and I took care of him as if he were my child. He was on a diet of Blue Buffalo Brown Rice and Lamb formula, and he was not allowed any table scraps or other foods. I recently began feeding him \u201cDingo Dental Bones For Total Care Minis\u201d at a rate of about one bone per day or every other day. This is the only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.In the consumer-submitted report, the dog\u2019s owner described a dental bones brand separate from Blue Buffalo as \u201cthe only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.\u201d That descriptor alluded to the difficulty in pinpointing sudden and severe illness in a beloved pet, particularly dogs.More to the point, the majority of pet owner reports involving a pet\u2019s meals in the day or days before the pet fell ill were likely to include one or more prominent national brands, of which Blue Buffalo was one. Dogs could consume any number of non-food items before falling ill in the night, and the pet\u2019s owner would recall having given their pet Purina, Alpo, or Blue Buffalo just prior to their sudden illness. In that respect, narrowing down the cause of illness would be perpetually likely to involve a major brand of pet food consumed the day before the pet fell ill or died.McDonald appended several screenshots of messages to her post, which had roughly thirty images in total. Of all the times readers shared this post, that indicated that perhaps one or two dozen users contacted her with suspicions about the safety of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones or other Blue Buffalo products.The two messages visible on McDonald\u2019s main post involved complaints about dog food, but not Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. The first complaint was from a woman who urged fellow dog owners not to feed their pets Blue Buffalo brand dog food, not chews. The second was even more vague, albeit heartbreaking, containing a woman\u2019s claim that she switched her dog to Blue Buffalo \u201ca few months\u201d prior to the dog\u2019s death due to unspecified causes \u2014 not due to dental bones, nor specifically something like pancreatitis or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.It is important to remember that Blue Buffalo and similarly prominent pet food brands are fed to millions of pets in the United States on a daily basis. Pets who fall ill or die suddenly are extremely likely to have eaten a brand\u2019s pet food due to their ubiquity and necessity alone. Pets are also unable to provide their owners with information about their illnesses or diets, leading heartbroken \u201cpet parents\u201d to attempt to piece together a definitive account of what sickened their dog or cat. In these examinations, a prominent brand of pet food is almost always likely to be on the list.Brand-related pet panics typically seem to center at least first around food, an issue addressed during a different panic in 2013. During that investigation, veterinarian Dr. Stephen Ettinger noted that \u201cit is rare that their food is responsible for the illness.\u201dEttinger further pointed out that anecdotal claims often take center stage when consumers feared danger in pet products:\u201cWhen a pet is sick, pet owners often look first to the pet\u2019s food as the cause. However, it is rare that their food is responsible for the illness,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ettinger in an article published by DVM360.com, a trade publication for veterinarians. Ettinger, an academic veterinarian at Cornell University, recently commented in a ConsumerAffairs story about similar complaints involving Beneful dog food.\u201cThese statements (the consumer postings) are not backed by any scientific studies, and the conditions described in the postings are amongst the most common conditions seen in everyday veterinary practice,\u201d said Ettinger said after reviewing many of the posted Beneful reports.Veterinary hospital organization VCA Hospitals maintained a page\u00a0about hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, explaining the condition and citing \u201cdietary indiscretion\u201d as a primary cause:Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) (also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [HGE]) is an acute (sudden) disorder of dogs characterized by vomiting and bloody diarrhea. Most cases occur without warning in otherwise healthy dogs. The main and most disturbing clinical sign is large amounts of bloody diarrhea, very often bright red. Some dogs may have a painful abdomen, decreased appetite, lethargy (fatigue), or fever. [\u2026]What causes AHDS? The exact cause of AHDS remains unknown (idiopathic). It may be related to dietary indiscretion (ingesting non-food items or different foods), immune-mediated disease, toxins, or pancreatitis. Stress, anxiety, and hyperactivity are thought to be possible contributing factors in many cases.On January 6 2020, Blue Buffalo specifically acknowledged the viral Blue Buffalo Dental Bones complaint on Facebook, writing:We\u2019ve heard from many of you on the recent social posts regarding our BLUE Dental Bones. As pet parents ourselves, there is nothing we hate more than hearing of a sick pet. Thank you for reaching out and showing your concern.We\u2019ve contacted this pet parent to learn more about their pup\u2019s recent health issue and would like to assure our loyal BLUE customers that our BLUE Dental Bones undergo significant quality and digestibility testing to ensure we provide the safest and healthiest product possible. We take all customer complaints very seriously and will continue to investigate this issue.Many of the top comments came from pet owners lodging complaints about their dogs\u2019 illnesses and Blue Buffalo products. The top comment was from a user who did not mention Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, but rather \u201cproduct\u201d:Our healthy 2 year old dog spent days in the er with hemmoragic gastronitis on the 22nd after eating your products as well. Many many dogs are all having the same symptoms. All at the same time all with you being the common denominator. We are getting our food and treats tested. We will never use your products again and are warning everyone we can to never use your products! You are making dogs sick and some are dying horrible deaths!Other users referenced a completely separate set of anecdotes (regarding reported heart problems in dogs), and several commenters left well wishes for Dallas while also adding that their dogs were healthy users of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. A second commenter also referenced what appeared to be kibble, not dental bones:Now we are another customer that just got back from the vet with a dog diagnoses of pancreatitis and a very hefty bill after opening a brand new bag Sunday morning. Luckily he only ate that one meal and then threw it up within the hour and hasn\u2019t had a bite since. We thought we might loose him. Hopefully our wallet will keep him alive because you\u2019re food wants otherwise.One person relayed a story of a different product being blamed for heart issues in humans, a product purportedly vindicated after a viral controversy. And a third shared a story of a recently deceased pet, referencing similar symptoms but not any specific mechanism or product:Alarming that your dog food and treats are still on shelves. My 5 year old completely healthy fur baby showed the same symptoms on the 23rd of December, took her to the vet and she passed away on Christmas. I will never buy a single product of yours again, and I will make sure everyone I know with fur babies is aware of these incidents and hopefully will also stay away from your products.A fourth person confidently claimed that 99 percent of veterinarians do not recommend Blue Buffalo. When asked to back up that assertion, the commenter said that they were \u201cjust repeating what they heard\u201d from a single veterinarian.A highly viral January 2020 claim was one of several Facebook pet-related safety warnings, urging dog owners to steer clear of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones due to the purported grave illness of one individual dog and based on a distressed owner\u2019s Google searching. A handful of fellow dog owners came forward to report similar suspicions, but many of their shared stories involved either different health conditions or different Blue Buffalo products. The Food and Drug Administration had no information regarding a safety risk with Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and its only result among recalls was a voluntary one based on the symptoms of one dog that later recovered. Although it remained possible Blue Buffalo Dental Bones were causing illness and death, the claim was difficult to narrow down due in part to the fact most dogs are fed commercially produced dog food from a handful of national brands \u2014 including Blue Buffalo.Correction: A previous version of this story had the date of the original post as January 5 2019, not January 5 2020. We apologize for the error. -bbn\nClaim: Blue Buffalo Dental Bones pose a severe risk of injury or death to dogs, gravely injured a dog named Dallas, and led to the deaths of other dogs.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Not enough information. \n\nWhile there are claims and anecdotes about Blue Buffalo Dental Bones leading to severe illness in dogs, there is no concrete evidence or official reports to confirm these claims.

{"claim_id":34166,"hypothesis":"In October 2019, the Rev. Robert Morey of St. Anthony's parish in Florence, South Carolina, refused former Vice President Joe Biden the Catholic rite of communion.","date_published":"October 30, 2019","explanation_1":"Until and unless we receive information that corroborates Morey\u2019s account.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights. The story was covered by several major national news outlets\u00a0but originated in a statement sent to the Florence Morning News by Robert Morey, a priest in the Catholic parish of St. Anthony in Florence, South Carolina. On Oct. 28, the Morning News reported that: Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church\u2019s 9 a.m. Mass\u2026 \u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Morey told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey added. Asked by Snopes to confirm, deny, or clarify Morey\u2019s account, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment on the story. Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":7484,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights.

{"claim_id":38613,"hypothesis":" An open letter to Oxford students demanding that a statute of Oxford benefactor Cecil Rhodes be removed from campus has gone viral. ","date_published":"March 30, 2016","explanation_1":"Oxford Pushes Back Letter About Cecil Rhodes Statute ","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"No author is listed for this open letter to Oxford University students demanding the removal of a Cecil Rhodes statute, and we haven\u2019t been able to verify where it came from. The \u201cRhodes Must Fall\u201d movement gained widespread publicity in early 2016. The Cecil Rhodes statute, which has sat outside a building at Oriel College for more than 100 years, represents racism and colonialism, student activists have argued. According to a Change.org petition started by supporters of the group: We find it deplorable that Oriel College continues to glorify an international criminal through its uncritical, deeply\u00a0violent iconography. As long as the statue remains, Oriel College\u00a0and Oxford University continue to tacitly identify with\u00a0Rhodes\u2019s values, and to maintain a toxic culture of domination and oppression. We believe that the colonialism, racism\u00a0and\u00a0patriarchy this statue is seeped in has no place in our university \u2013 which for many of us is also our home. The\u00a0removal of this statue would be a welcome first step in the University\u2019s\u00a0attempt to redress the ways in which it has\u00a0been an active beneficiary of empire. While it remains standing, the statue of Rhodes remains a celebration not just of\u00a0the crimes of the\u00a0man himself, but of the imperialist legacy on which Oxford University has thrived, and continues to\u00a0thrive. While the statue remains standing, Oxford University continues to\u00a0condone the persistent racism that shadows\u00a0this institution. At issue is Cecil Rhodes\u2019 legacy of British imperialism in South Africa, where he served as prime minister of Cape Colony and enforced racial segregation. Rhodes was intent on \u201cpainting the map red\u201d (a term for British colonization) in Africa, and he even dreamed of reclaiming the American colonies for the British Empire, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. After his political career, Cecil Rhodes became the benefactor of the Rhodes Scholarships. Each year, 32 American students are selected as Rhodes Scholars for \u201ctheir character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.\u201d Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten told student demonstrators in January that Nelson Mendela had endorse the Rhodes scholarships, and that those who were not prepared to embrace freedom of though should \u201cthink about being educated elsewhere,\u201d The Guardian reports: In early February, Oxford University administrators announced that they would not remove the Rhodes statue from campus, despite concerns from student groups. After the Oxford Union backed a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes statute on January 20th, it was later revealed that the statute would remain due to pressure from donors, the Telegraph reports: \u201cI think that we are giving them [the students] the respect of listening to their views, even when we don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he told the\u00a0Today programme on BBC Radio 4. \u201cBut if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards\u00a0Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for\u00a0any undergraduate, Karl Popper\u2019s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about\u00a0being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.\u201d \u201cThat focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in American campuses and British\u00a0campuses,\u201d Patten said. \u201cOne of the points of a university \u2013 which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free\u00a0inquiry and debate \u2013 is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don\u2019t like and talk\u00a0about them and debate them.\u201d He added: \u201cCan you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people,\u00a0it\u2019s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to\u00a0talk about western values, which I regard as glob.\u201d By mid-February, administrators made clear that the Rhodes statute would not be removed. Around that same time, the \u201cOxford Pushes Back\u201d letter to student demonstrators first surfaced on a discussion board called the Daily Gripe, on February 13th.

The \u201cRhodes Must Fall\u201d movement gained widespread publicity in early 2016. The Cecil Rhodes statute, which has sat outside a building at Oriel College for more than 100 years, represents racism and colonialism, student activists have argued. According to a Change.org petition started by supporters of the group: We find it deplorable that Oriel College continues to glorify an international criminal through its uncritical, deeply\u00a0violent iconography. As long as the statue remains, Oriel College\u00a0and Oxford University continue to tacitly identify with\u00a0Rhodes\u2019s values, and to maintain a toxic culture of domination and oppression. We believe that the colonialism, racism\u00a0and\u00a0patriarchy this statue is seeped in has no place in our university \u2013 which for many of us is also our home. The\u00a0removal of this statue would be a welcome first step in the University\u2019s\u00a0attempt to redress the ways in which it has\u00a0been an active beneficiary of empire. While it remains standing, the statue of Rhodes remains a celebration not just of\u00a0the crimes of the\u00a0man himself, but of the imperialist legacy on which Oxford University has thrived, and continues to\u00a0thrive. While the statue remains standing, Oxford University continues to\u00a0condone the persistent racism that shadows\u00a0this institution. At issue is Cecil Rhodes\u2019 legacy of British imperialism in South Africa, where he served as prime minister of Cape Colony and enforced racial segregation. Rhodes was intent on \u201cpainting the map red\u201d (a term for British colonization) in Africa, and he even dreamed of reclaiming the American colonies for the British Empire, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. After his political career, Cecil Rhodes became the benefactor of the Rhodes Scholarships. Each year, 32 American students are selected as Rhodes Scholars for \u201ctheir character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead.\u201d Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten told student demonstrators in January that Nelson Mendela had endorse the Rhodes scholarships, and that those who were not prepared to embrace freedom of though should \u201cthink about being educated elsewhere,\u201d The Guardian reports: In early February, Oxford University administrators announced that they would not remove the Rhodes statue from campus, despite concerns from student groups. After the Oxford Union backed a motion to remove the Cecil Rhodes statute on January 20th, it was later revealed that the statute would remain due to pressure from donors, the Telegraph reports: \u201cI think that we are giving them [the students] the respect of listening to their views, even when we don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he told the\u00a0Today programme on BBC Radio 4. \u201cBut if people at a university are not prepared to demonstrate the sort of generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards\u00a0Rhodes and towards history, if they are not prepared to embrace all those values which are contained in the most important book for\u00a0any undergraduate, Karl Popper\u2019s Open Society, if they are not prepared to embrace those issues then maybe they should think about\u00a0being educated elsewhere. But I hope they will embrace those issues and engage in debate.\u201d \u201cThat focus on Rhodes is unfortunate but it\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening in American campuses and British\u00a0campuses,\u201d Patten said. \u201cOne of the points of a university \u2013 which is not to tolerate intolerance, to engage in free\u00a0inquiry and debate \u2013 is being denied. People have to face up to facts in history which they don\u2019t like and talk\u00a0about them and debate them.\u201d He added: \u201cCan you imagine a university where there is no platform? I mean a bland diet of bran to feed people,\u00a0it\u2019s an absolutely terrible idea. If you want universities like that you go to China where they are not allowed to\u00a0talk about western values, which I regard as glob.\u201d By mid-February, administrators made clear that the Rhodes statute would not be removed. Around that same time, the \u201cOxford Pushes Back\u201d letter to student demonstrators first surfaced on a discussion board called the Daily Gripe, on February 13th. Some of Patten\u2019s quotes are included in the Oxford Pushes Back letter, but there\u2019s no indication that he actually wrote it, or that it came from the university. In the end, there\u2019s no way to tell who the original author was.

Instead, UCR data show that violent crime in El Paso generally followed a national trend. It spiked to its highest level in 30 years in the early 1990s and has steadily declined since. The following graph compares crime data from the El Paso Police Department with nationwide figures from 1985 to 2015. Source: Uniform Crime Report. In that 30-year time frame, El Paso was never one of the \u201cmost dangerous cities\u201d in the United States. When compared to cities with similarly-sized populations, El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate consistently fell well below locales such as Boston, Baltimore, Detroit, and Memphis, according to UCR data (which can be found online). In 2018, US News & World Report ranked El Paso number 11 in \u201cbest places to retire,\u201d citing in part the community\u2019s relative safety and thriving economy. This ranking was not new, as El Paso had regularly been ranked one of the country\u2019s safest cities for its population size going as far back as 2005 \u2014 three years before the border fence there was built. Construction on the barrier between El Paso and Juarez began in 2008 under President George W. Bush and was completed in 2009 as part of a larger border security plan known as \u201cOperation Hold the Line\u201d which was launched in 1993. UCR data drawn from the El Paso Police Department shows that violent crime, already trending downward, continued to drop fairly consistently in the five years leading up to fence construction, from a high of 6,109 incidents in 1993 to an all-time low in 2006 of 2,422: Source: Uniform Crime Report.

What did make a difference was a flood of Border Patrol agents, who began Operation Hold the Line in 1993. Hundreds of agents were stationed every few feet along the border. Violent crime in El Paso drastically reduced in the years following. \u201cWe\u2019ve played a big part of that,\u201d said Border Patrol Sector Chief Aaron Hull. We can\u2019t determine whether crime in El Paso fell as a result of increased Border Patrol presence, the dynamic that caused crime to drop nationwide, or some combination of both.

Claiming Breitbart was standing with the Trump campaign instead of its own employees, Fields and several other Breitbart employees resigned.

I never touched you.\"\" But security footage of the event released by the Jupiter Police Department March 29 appears to show Lewandowski grabbing Fields. (video from the Washington Post) Despite the recent video, Trump said Lewandowski didn\u2019t misrepresent what happened. Rather, it\u2019s Fields who is being deceptive, he said. \"\"(Fields) said she went to the ground, or something to the effect of she almost went to the ground,\"\" Trump said at a March 29 CNN town hall. \"\"She was in pain. She went to the ground. When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed. She didn't talk about it.\"\" Trump asked on Twitter why no one was checking to see how Fields\u2019 story changed, and Fields responded, \"\"Because my story never changed. Seriously, just stop lying.\"\" Did Fields change her story on what happened between her and Lewandowski? It appears not. We couldn\u2019t find an example of her publicly retelling what happened since the second week of March when the story first unfolded. And since the security footage became public March 29, Fields has not yet given an interview. We tried to reach Trump and Fields and did not hear back. At the CNN town hall, Trump said Fields\u2019 initial claim was that she fell to the ground or that she almost fell to the ground. It was the latter. \"\"I was jolted backwards,\"\" Fields wrote March 10. \"\"Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken.\"\" The Washington Post\u2019s Ben Terris witnessed the incident and wrote a similar account the same day. \"\"As security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit ballroom, (Fields) pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question,\"\" Terris wrote. \"\"I watched as a man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s 41-year-old campaign manager.\"\" Lewandowski and the Trump campaign immediately denied Fields\u2019 accusation. \"\"The accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false,\"\" spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement. \"\"As one of the dozens of individuals present as Mr. Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.\"\" Fields stood by her account of what happened in a March 14 interview with Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly. \"\"This is a campaign that continues to lie,\"\" she said. \"\"I never wanted it to get this way. Those bruises will heal. My problem is the smearing of my name, my reputation.\"\" Following the incident, Breitbart editor-at-large Joel Pollak published a report where he questioned whether it was actually Lewandowski who grabbed Fields rather than another man. Claiming Breitbart was standing with the Trump campaign instead of its own employees, Fields and several other Breitbart employees resigned. Since the security footage came out in the past couple days, though, Pollak has admitted that his report was incorrect. Trump, conversely, said the footage \"\"exonerates\"\" Lewandowski \"\"totally.\"\" It doesn\u2019t; it looks from the video as if he did grab her \u2014 and the police report says the video is consistent with what Fields\u00a0alleged. Trump also criticized Fields for allegedly grabbing him to ask a question and for holding a pen. While somewhat expected for a reporter to have a pen handy, Trump said it could have been a \"\"little bomb\"\" or a knife. Our ruling Trump said that when Michelle Fields \"\"found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.\"\" We see no evidence that Fields\u2019 story about her altercation with Trump\u2019s campaign manager has changed. She gave an initial account and hasn't backed off of it.\"n\nClaim: \"Donald Trump Says that when Michelle Fields \"\"found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that Donald Trump said when Michelle Fields found out there was security camera footage, her story changed is false. The evidence provided shows that Fields' story has remained consistent since the incident on March 8, and she has not given any interviews or changed her account since the security footage was released on March 29. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that her story changed after the security footage was revealed."}

The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women.

The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to.

In particular, the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor posed a risk to customers of U-Haul, who were at risk specifically if they were moving into a new neighborhood where the rumor had taken root.","fact_checkers":"  Kim LaCapria  ","premise":"\"A June 27 2020 post by\u00a0user\u00a0Cindy Kowalczyk was shared thousands of times, claiming (without citations or sources) that \u201cAntifa plans residential Neighborhood attacks\u201d using U-Haul moving trucks:The Rumor and Earlier IterationsIn the above screenshot, black text against a gray background read:Just a heads up for all my Facebook family It has been reported Antifa plans residential Neighborhood attacks.

I am not revealing my personal iMessages and sources of messages I get via Facebook to you or anyone else.As observed by the commenter, the information was suspiciously without a source. Its content was also structured in passive voice, asserting \u201cit has been reported\u201d (but not by whom) and adding the more nebulous \u201capparently reports [said. ]\u201dThe claim appeared to be yet another variation on a previously viral (and completely false) claim that antifa protesters were being \u201cbused\u201d into Ada, Oklahoma:Were Four Busloads of Protesters (or \u2018Antifa\u2019) in Ada, Oklahoma Met by \u2018600 Armed Americans,\u2019 \u2014 and the News Won\u2019t Report It?Kowalczyk maintained the antifa U-Haul rumor would not be reported by \u201cmainstream news\u201d sources, an element in common with the above \u201cbusloads of protesters\u201d rumor. That particular claim was embedded in both rumors, providing an immediate suggestion that an absence of verification or credible source was due not to it being a falsehood, but some sort of media conspiracy to suppress brewing \u201cattacks.\u201dInherent Risks, Coded Language, and No Clear PointAs commenters observed, the rumor had another innate risk \u2014 U-Haul trucks are generally used by individuals or families during a residential move.On top of that, anyone arriving in a U-Haul truck to a new neighborhood was likely to, at that point, be unknown to their new neighbors. By suggesting that strangers in U-Hauls were \u201cplanning attacks on residential neighborhoods,\u201d the rumor posed a risk to any innocent people who just happened to be moving at the time it spread.A longer post which mentioned the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor demonstrated how anyone who was unlucky enough to be driving a U-Haul in late June and early July 2020 was at risk due to the rumor, and it mentioned a concurrent false rumor about anti-fascist protesters, Gettysburg, and July 4th 2020:ANTIFA PLAN:\ufffc 30,000 members per state\u2026many trained by radical Islam they plan on killing as many Trump supporters and whites as possible! !ANTIFA To Desecrate Gettysburg National Cemetery on July 4 [2020]- Then MURDER & BURN White Suburbs under cover of \u201cFireworks\u201d[\u2026]Side note: In VA, Jonesey adding a confirmation to this post.

Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa.

Apparently reports say they will be renting uhauls to carry people unnoticed into tthe neighborhoods. Keep your eyes open let your neighbors know and be safe.A commenter on the post asked for a source:Just curious as to where this info came from? Reports? From who?Kowalczyk responded twice:I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t come from CNN or any other mainstream media news source.here we go again. It was sent to me. I am not revealing my personal iMessages and sources of messages I get via Facebook to you or anyone else.As observed by the commenter, the information was suspiciously without a source. Its content was also structured in passive voice, asserting \u201cit has been reported\u201d (but not by whom) and adding the more nebulous \u201capparently reports [said. ]\u201dThe claim appeared to be yet another variation on a previously viral (and completely false) claim that antifa protesters were being \u201cbused\u201d into Ada, Oklahoma:Were Four Busloads of Protesters (or \u2018Antifa\u2019) in Ada, Oklahoma Met by \u2018600 Armed Americans,\u2019 \u2014 and the News Won\u2019t Report It?Kowalczyk maintained the antifa U-Haul rumor would not be reported by \u201cmainstream news\u201d sources, an element in common with the above \u201cbusloads of protesters\u201d rumor. That particular claim was embedded in both rumors, providing an immediate suggestion that an absence of verification or credible source was due not to it being a falsehood, but some sort of media conspiracy to suppress brewing \u201cattacks.\u201dInherent Risks, Coded Language, and No Clear PointAs commenters observed, the rumor had another innate risk \u2014 U-Haul trucks are generally used by individuals or families during a residential move.On top of that, anyone arriving in a U-Haul truck to a new neighborhood was likely to, at that point, be unknown to their new neighbors. By suggesting that strangers in U-Hauls were \u201cplanning attacks on residential neighborhoods,\u201d the rumor posed a risk to any innocent people who just happened to be moving at the time it spread.A longer post which mentioned the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor demonstrated how anyone who was unlucky enough to be driving a U-Haul in late June and early July 2020 was at risk due to the rumor, and it mentioned a concurrent false rumor about anti-fascist protesters, Gettysburg, and July 4th 2020:ANTIFA PLAN:\ufffc 30,000 members per state\u2026many trained by radical Islam they plan on killing as many Trump supporters and whites as possible! !ANTIFA To Desecrate Gettysburg National Cemetery on July 4 [2020]- Then MURDER & BURN White Suburbs under cover of \u201cFireworks\u201d[\u2026]Side note: In VA, Jonesey adding a confirmation to this post. [On June 28 2020] at his local firework stand that has been at the same spot for years\u2026there was a semi truck delivery, at which point Uhaul trucks from all over where loading up.The claim also referenced \u201cresidential neighborhoods,\u201d which was puzzling. Any area zoned for homes and apartments was a \u201cresidential neighborhood,\u201d but people expressing concerns sparked by rumors like these appeared to think it was specifically about\u00a0their neighborhoods, all across the United States.It was clear from comments on the post that the rumor was causing significant fear, but aside from \u201cattacks,\u201d the post didn\u2019t provide any clear objective. It merely stated that \u201cantifa\u201d rented U-Hauls en masse, and left sharers to fill in the details with their imaginations.Judging by the rumor\u2019s traction, the strategy was highly effective.A First Wave of the Same RumorTwitter nuisance and Pizzagate pusher Jack Posobiec\u00a0made a point of\u00a0mentioning vague and unsourced \u201cintelligence\u201d received by police in New York and Washington, DC about the use of U-Hauls on June 2 2020:UPDATE: Now DC is receiving intelligence about U-Haul trucks connected to suspected weapons stashes around the city\u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) June 2, 2020It\u2019s Going Down\u00a0tweeted about the rumors on the same day, citing a Fox News article with dubious information:Neo-Nazi groups, already shut down by Twitter, promoted on social media the lie that \"\"ANTIFA\"\" was going to come into suburban \"\"white hoods\"\" to riot and attack people. Now this lie is being promoted at #FoxNews. Egregious example of misinformation and manipulation. pic.twitter.com\/mrBXhyeb37\u2014 It's Going Down (@IGD_News) June 2, 2020@IGD_News referenced a June 2 2020 Fox News article\u00a0(\u201cAntifa arrests coming, concerns over riots heading to suburbia, government source says\u201d) which essentially served as an in-print version of the same rumor. Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa. Two days later, Twitter nuisance Jack Posobiec and Fox News spread iterations of the claim; predictably, no such \u201cinvasion\u201d came to pass. A similar and likely directly related rumor circulated about \u201cantifa buses\u201d in Ada, Oklahoma, and it too was false. In particular, the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor posed a risk to customers of U-Haul, who were at risk specifically if they were moving into a new neighborhood where the rumor had taken root.Comments\"n\nClaim: \"Antifa is renting U-Hauls to quietly infiltrate \"\"residential neighborhoods\"\" for \"\"attacks.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that Antifa is renting U-Hauls to infiltrate residential neighborhoods for attacks is false.

{"claim_id":10255,"hypothesis":"Study Finds Single, Escalated Dose of Brachytherapy Radiation May Be a Safe and Effective Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer","date_published":"March 3, 2017","explanation_1":"This news release from a professional society of radiation oncologists summarizes a trial in 58 men with Stage 1 localized prostate cancer that found using a single treatment of\u00a0high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (where radioactive implants are inserted directly into the tissue) may be an acceptable and safe alternative to typical longer, but lower doses of radiation. Recognizing\u00a0that a higher dose, single radiation treatment could be more toxic to tissues surrounding the prostate, this trial set out to measure the effectiveness and safety of such treatment. While the research was non-randomized, its generally positive tone was balanced by\u00a0emphasizing that there needs to be additional follow-up research to see how it compares with conventional approaches. After stating in the headline the treatment \u201cmay be safe and effective,\u201d the release provides a fairly detailed description of harms. A concern with this study is that nearly all of the patient volunteers would have been candidates for active surveillance\u2013meaning that they did not need an active treatment. With no caveat that expert guidelines recommend surveillance for low-risk Stage 1 prostate cancers, this release engages in disease-mongering. It is recognized that exposure to radioactive treatments can be harmful and so finding other ways to treat tumors in the prostate should be welcomed. If a treatment for localized prostate cancer which is\u00a0administered in a single procedure, is equally effective and safe as conventional treatment, it is possible that patients may have fewer side effects and adverse events related to their prostate cancer treatment. This\u00a0study provides some\u00a0data on the safety and tolerability of the single dose of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy compared to\u00a0LDR brachytherapy, \u00a0It is important to note that these patients were a very select sample of prostate cancer patients (low to intermediate risk) and so extrapolating those findings to other prostate cancer patients may not be appropriate.","fact_checkers":"Alan Cassels,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"There was zero mention of cost, which is unfortunate because presumably a single treatment would entail fewer costs than one that involved multiple procedures. The main benefit focused on a vaguely described \u201cbiochemical progression,\u201d which means that there was some evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Determining PSA progression is more complicated following radiation because it takes time for the PSA level to stabilize (unlike following surgery to remove the prostate) before you can determine whether the PSA is rising. Biochemical progression is also a surrogate measure and does not imply that the cancer is\u2013or will\u2013clinically progress. The researchers did acknowledge that the actual benefits are unknown, saying that \u201cas the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d The release provided detailed information on harms: \u201cWithin the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency\/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\u201d But given that many oncology experts would consider the treatment unnecessary, any level of toxicity\u00a0could be considered unacceptable. The lay reader would have benefited from a description of what \u201cgrade 2 or grad 3+\u201d levels of toxicity means. There were a few issues that could have been clarified: the fact that these men were quite low risk to start with, that five of the initial patients dropped out of the study (and we aren\u2019t told why) and that this was a non-randomized, prospective clinical trial which is potentially subject to a series of biases. The key takeaway is that this evidence does not establish the superiority of this approach to any other radiotherapy, any active treatment, or active surveillance. The quote from a study author at the end of the release indicating that more research was required and this study was not definitive proof of the superiority of the 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy was a welcome caution, and somewhat at odds with the overall positive tone of the release. Promoting brachytherapy radiation for treatment of low-risk men is a form of disease-mongering, particularly since there is no mention of the surveillance option.

The news release suggests that this is a new strategy based on new research but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. According to UpToDate, an evidence-based list of practice recommendations published by Wolters Kluwer, use of single, high dose brachytherapy for prostate cancer is not novel: \u201cThe HDR brachytherapy dose is usually administered in one to four large dose fractions over a period of time, typically 24 to 40 hours.

Reporter Bill Melugin posted a photograph of the alleged tampon on Twitter:The officer was reportedly not wearing his uniform and paid for the drink with a debit card issued by a police credit union.We contacted Target seeking comment; the company sent us the same statement it gave to KTTV:We take this allegation seriously. We have reviewed video footage and have not found any suspicious behavior. We have shared the video with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and look forward to the conclusions of their investigation.Reached for comment and asked how the officer determined that the alleged object was a tampon, the sheriff\u2019s department also shared a statement:Walnut Station Detectives are investigating an incident of alleged poisoning of food or drink at a local business. The incident was reported to have occurred Friday, June 19, 2020 at approximately 2:30p.m., on the 700 block of Grand Avenue in the city of Diamond Bar. The victim as a male White 36 years-old. This is an ongoing investigation. No further information is available at this time.The claim was formally debunked in late July 2020, when \u2014\u00a0according to KTTV \u2014 police determined that there was no \u201cattack.\u201d The staff member who prepared the drink unwittingly \u201cscooped up a cleaning cloth that had fallen into ice\u201d into the officer\u2019s drink.\u201cThe investigation was unable to prove malicious intent on the part of the store employee,\u201d Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing local officers, initially called the alleged incident a \u201cdisgusting assault on a police officer was carried out by someone with hatred in their heart.\u201dBut even before the company\u2019s statement, the claim of \u201cassault\u201d drew skepticism. Two separate news sites, Jezebel and Vice, conducted their own tests to see whether a tampon dipped into a Frappuccino would come out looking like the object in Melugin\u2019s photo. The results of both tests ran counter to police allegations. According to Jezebel\u2019s Megan Reynolds:The substance found in the Frappuccino does not resemble any sort of tampon that I\u2019ve ever used or seen in the wild. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s clumpy, and if you look at it quickly, resembles a cat hairball or maybe some paper towels. A tampon doesn\u2019t expand lengthwise and if it did, the shape would be uniform and not lumpen and irregular, as this item is. Tampons expand widthwise to accommodate a wide variety of body shapes and types. Everyone\u2019s vagina is different, but a tampon that resembled housing insulation or a long clot of cotton batting would be entirely ineffective.Meanwhile, Vice reported that the object posted in Melugin\u2019s photograph measured 4.957 inches, nearly an inch longer than the final length of the tampon the site used to recreate the alleged incident by soaking it in water and then leaving it inside a Frappuccino for two hours.\u201cSuspicious, but not outside the realm of possibility for a lesser-quality tampon,\u201d Vice noted. \u201cOther things to keep in mind is that it appears the very bottom of the tampon is cut off in the photo uploaded to Twitter, and we do not know what zoom the image was taken at.\u201dThe intentional poisoning claim from Los Angeles police came less than a month after police union officials in New York City accused workers at a Shake Shack restaurant in Manhattan of doing the same to their own colleagues. As the New York Post reported:A lieutenant from the Bronx blasted out an email to the unions that six cops \u201cstarted throwing up after drinking beverages they got from shake shack on 200 Broadway.\u201dIt was unclear why the sergeant and lieutenant escalated the situation.Detectives easily closed the case after interviewing five employees and reviewing surveillance footage showing the shakes were made normally, sources said.The machine was cleaned before the officers ordered, according to sources, and it still contained residual milkstone remover \u2014 a typically acidic solution used to combat buildup in dairy equipment.But by 10:45 p.m., the Detectives Endowment Association was declaring that Finest had become \u201cill\u201d after being \u201cintentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack\u201d \u2014 as Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch made a show of visiting Bellevue while his union declared at 10:47 p.m. that police officers came \u201cunder attack\u201d from a \u201ctoxic substance, believed to be bleach.\u201dThe allegation was debunked only one day later when Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison posted, \u201cAfter a thorough investigation by the NYPD\u2019s Manhattan South investigators, it has been determined that there was no criminality by shake shack\u2019s employees.\u201dIt is worth noting that the \u201cshunned policeman\u201d is a known urban legend \u2014 a subtheme of the \u201cshunned serviceman\u201d folklore. The stories generally revolve around either some sort of attempt to poison or harm the aggrieved party via something put in their food or drink, or outright refusal to serve them.

Reporter Bill Melugin posted a photograph of the alleged tampon on Twitter:The officer was reportedly not wearing his uniform and paid for the drink with a debit card issued by a police credit union.We contacted Target seeking comment; the company sent us the same statement it gave to KTTV:We take this allegation seriously. We have reviewed video footage and have not found any suspicious behavior. We have shared the video with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and look forward to the conclusions of their investigation.Reached for comment and asked how the officer determined that the alleged object was a tampon, the sheriff\u2019s department also shared a statement:Walnut Station Detectives are investigating an incident of alleged poisoning of food or drink at a local business. The incident was reported to have occurred Friday, June 19, 2020 at approximately 2:30p.m., on the 700 block of Grand Avenue in the city of Diamond Bar. The victim as a male White 36 years-old. This is an ongoing investigation. No further information is available at this time.The claim was formally debunked in late July 2020, when \u2014\u00a0according to KTTV \u2014 police determined that there was no \u201cattack.\u201d The staff member who prepared the drink unwittingly \u201cscooped up a cleaning cloth that had fallen into ice\u201d into the officer\u2019s drink.\u201cThe investigation was unable to prove malicious intent on the part of the store employee,\u201d Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing local officers, initially called the alleged incident a \u201cdisgusting assault on a police officer was carried out by someone with hatred in their heart.\u201dBut even before the company\u2019s statement, the claim of \u201cassault\u201d drew skepticism. Two separate news sites, Jezebel and Vice, conducted their own tests to see whether a tampon dipped into a Frappuccino would come out looking like the object in Melugin\u2019s photo. The results of both tests ran counter to police allegations. According to Jezebel\u2019s Megan Reynolds:The substance found in the Frappuccino does not resemble any sort of tampon that I\u2019ve ever used or seen in the wild.

The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene.The folks in the lab finally figured out what it was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise. It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields. Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners. The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver\u2019s remains were not recovered; however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.

Perhaps it\u2019s the vicarious enjoyment of a Tim Allen-ish \u201cMore Power!\u201d fantasy carried to its fatal yet hilarious conclusion. Or maybe it\u2019s a simple matter of cars and the men who love them, the eternal love affair. Whatever. The boys love it, and that\u2019s all that matters. This tale of vehicular velocity ferocity has been popular among servicemen since the late 1970s. In those early word-of-mouth versions, the JATO was taken from a cargo plane or out of a warehouse on base, thereby answering a key question left up in the air in later versions: Where did the intrepid lad obtain the engine? The story is even older than that. One of our readers says he heard it in 1961 or 1962. In that version, two JATO units mounted as \u201clakers\u201d (exhaust pipes) on a 1940 Ford were fired on Bayshore freeway while trying to outrun the California Highway Patrol. The car was last seen going end over end across San Francisco bay. Another reader heard it in 1964 while stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. In that version, the unmanned JATO\u2019d car went airborne and smashed into a tree, destroying both car and plant. The version we now know and love (complete with puzzled police and the smoldering wreck of what\u2019s left of a car impacted into the face of a cliff), began making the cyberspatial rounds in 1990. In 1992 the incident was said to have happened in New Mexico, with the car being a Plymouth Road Runner. By 1994 the car had transformed itself into a Chevrolet Impala, but now the accident\u2019s venue was California. (See how these things mutate over time?) 1995 saw this legend just about take over the Internet as it was flashed from e-mail to e-mail as \u201cthis year\u2019s Darwin Award winner.\u201d It\u2019s this version which is still in circulation today, the car frozen in time as a Chevy Impala, the location given as somewhere in Arizona. As it appeared in 1995: \u201cDarwin award\u201d Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards \u2014 it\u2019s an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way.Last year\u2019s winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke(tm) machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And for this year\u2019s nominee, the story is: The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, on the outside of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The boys in the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra `push\u2019 for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the JATO!! Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between 250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve \u2026 The brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the car. TODAY\u2019S LESSON: Solid-fuel rockets don\u2019t have an \u2018off\u2019 switch \u2026 Nor, so it seems, do good stories. A spokesman of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated in a 1996 newspaper article the JATO story wasn\u2019t true though they continued to get asked about it. \u201cWe get a call on that about every 90 days,\u201d said Dave Myers. \u201cIt keeps us on the map.\u201d There are two fatal problems with the JATO story. First, anybody who understood the extreme forces involved well enough to attach a JATO unit to a car so that it would keep the car going in a straight line (rather than immediately spinning around) would probably know better than to do it in the first place. Second, the Arizona Highway Patrol has a phone number. A call to them will confirm they\u2019ve both heard the story and no, it\u2019s not true. Sorry, fellas. Though the legend of the smoldering Chevy smashed into a cliff face is pure fabrication, JATO engines have been mounted on cars on a couple of occasions. As reported in Motor Trend in 1957, Dodge took a brand-new car out to El Mirage dry lake bed in California, removed the gas tank, and mounted a JATO unit in its place. (The intent was to test the car\u2019s brakes and to film the event for TV commercials.) The car went 140 mph. Flynn, Mike. The Best Book of Bizarre But True Stories Ever. London: Carlton, 1999.

As it appeared in 1995: \u201cDarwin award\u201d Nominee: You all know about the Darwin awards \u2014 it\u2019s an annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way.Last year\u2019s winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke(tm) machine, which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it. And for this year\u2019s nominee, the story is: The Arizona (U.S.) Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road, on the outside of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The boys in the lab finally figured out what it was, and what had happened. It seems that a guy had somehow got hold of a JATO unit, (Jet Assisted Take Off, actually a solid-fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra `push\u2019 for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert, and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed, and fired off the JATO!! Best as they could determine, he was doing somewhere between 250 and 300 mph (350-420kph) when he came to that curve \u2026 The brakes were completely burned away, apparently from trying to slow the car. TODAY\u2019S LESSON: Solid-fuel rockets don\u2019t have an \u2018off\u2019 switch \u2026 Nor, so it seems, do good stories. A spokesman of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated in a 1996 newspaper article the JATO story wasn\u2019t true though they continued to get asked about it. \u201cWe get a call on that about every 90 days,\u201d said Dave Myers. \u201cIt keeps us on the map.\u201d There are two fatal problems with the JATO story. First, anybody who understood the extreme forces involved well enough to attach a JATO unit to a car so that it would keep the car going in a straight line (rather than immediately spinning around) would probably know better than to do it in the first place. Second, the Arizona Highway Patrol has a phone number. A call to them will confirm they\u2019ve both heard the story and no, it\u2019s not true. Sorry, fellas. Though the legend of the smoldering Chevy smashed into a cliff face is pure fabrication, JATO engines have been mounted on cars on a couple of occasions. As reported in Motor Trend in 1957, Dodge took a brand-new car out to El Mirage dry lake bed in California, removed the gas tank, and mounted a JATO unit in its place. (The intent was to test the car\u2019s brakes and to film the event for TV commercials.) The car went 140 mph. Flynn, Mike. The Best Book of Bizarre But True Stories Ever. London: Carlton, 1999.

Among the many issues it covers, one in particular, found in Chapter 2 Section 212, is the prohibition of entry to the US if the Alien belongs to an organization seeking to overthrow the government of the United States by \u201cforce, violence, or other unconstitutional means.\u201d This, by its very definition, rules out Islamic immigration to the United States. This law is being ignored by the White House. Islamic immigration to the U.S. is prohibited under this law because the Koran, Sharia Law and the Hadith all require complete submission to Islam, which is antithetical to the US government, the Constitution, and to the Republic. All Muslims who believe that the Koran is life\u2019s guiding principal also believe in total submission to islam & sharia law. To all who claim that Islam is a religion, read the law again \u2026 the law states that Aliens who are affiliated with ANY \u201corganization\u201d that advocates the overthrow of the U.S. government are prohibited.

'\u201d\u00a0 The law\u00a0referenced was the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as the\u00a0McCarran\u2013Walter Act. Its text is available in full at the U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services (USCIS) web site, where a preface indicates\u00a0that the law has \u201cbeen amended many times over the years but is still the basic body of immigration law.\u201d The claim typically cited \u201cChapter 2 Section 212\u201d of the Act, which excludes as ineligible for admission the following persons: In general\u00a0any alien\u00a0who a consular officer or the Attorney General knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in\u00a0any activity a purpose of which is the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means. That law, originally aimed at Communists, could be used now to exclude persons (both Muslims and non-Muslims) who have demonstrated an affiliation or sympathy with violent extremist groups professing Islamist motivations and goals (e.g., ISIS, al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram) from entering the U.S., but asserting that it enables a de facto ban on all Muslims is inaccurate. Most major religions involve basic, agreed-upon sets of tenets by\u00a0which their faithful live, and no widely-accepted understanding of Islam encompasses a prohibition on\u00a0following the laws of any country or advocates the overthrow of government. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was not without critics, among them President Harry S. Truman, who vetoed the bill on\u00a025 June 1952. In a letter titled \u201cVeto of Bill to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality\u201d and addressed to the House of Representatives, President Truman described\u00a0the bill\u2019s provisions as both antithetical to American values and discriminatory: The greatest vice of the present quota system, however, is that it discriminates, deliberately and intentionally, against many of the peoples of the world \u2026\u00a0The desired effect [of selective admission of immigrants] was obtained\u00a0\u2026\u00a0People from such countries as Greece, or Spain, or Latvia were virtually deprived of any opportunity to come here at all, simply because Greeks or Spaniards or Latvians had not come here before 1920 in any substantial numbers. The idea behind this discriminatory policy was, to put it baldly, that Americans with English or Irish names were better people and better citizens than Americans with Italian or Greek or Polish names. It was thought that people of West European origin made better citizens than Rumanians or Yugoslavs or Ukrainians or Hungarians or Baits or Austrians. Such a concept is utterly unworthy of our traditions and our ideals. It violates the great political doctrine of the Declaration of Independence that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d It denies the humanitarian creed inscribed beneath the Statue of Liberty proclaiming to all nations, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d It repudiates our basic religious concepts, our belief in the brotherhood of man, and in the words of St. Paul that \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free \u2026. for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d In that letter President Truman\u00a0further maintained the act\u2019s provisions were out of alignment with foreign policy goals, inhibiting immigrants who needed it most from seeking safe harbor in America: The basis of this quota system was false and unworthy in 1924. It is even worse now. At the present time, this quota system keeps out the very people we want to bring in. It is incredible to me that, in this year of 1952, we should again be enacting into law such a slur on the patriotism, the capacity, and the decency of a large part of our citizenry. Today, we have entered into an alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty, with Italy, Greece, and Turkey against one of the most terrible threats mankind has ever faced. We are asking them to join with us in protecting the peace of the world. We are helping them to build their defenses, and train their men, in the common cause. But, through this bill we say to their people: You are less worthy to come to this country than Englishmen or Irishmen; you Italians, who need to find homes abroad in the hundreds of thousands \u2014 you shall have a quota of 5,645; you Greeks, struggling to assist the helpless victims of a communist civil war \u2014 you shall have a quota of 308; and you Turks, you are brave defenders of the Eastern flank, but you shall have a quota of only 225! Truman\u2019s words seemed exceptionally prescient when he spoke of citizens in countries that had in recent years fallen behind the Iron Curtain: Today, we are \u201cprotecting\u201d ourselves, as we were in 1924, against being flooded by immigrants from Eastern Europe. This is fantastic. The countries of Eastern Europe have fallen under the communist yoke \u2014 they are silenced, fenced off by barbed wire and minefields \u2014 no one passes their borders but at the risk of his life. We do not need to be protected against immigrants from these countries \u2014 on the contrary we want to stretch out a helping hand, to save those who have managed to flee into Western Europe, to succor those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism, to welcome and restore them against the day when their countries will, as we hope, be free again \u2026\u00a0some 30,000 Rumanians, who have managed to escape the labor camps and the mass deportations of their Soviet masters, have asked our help. These are only a few examples of the absurdity, the cruelty of carrying over into this year of 1952 the isolationist limitations of our 1924 law. In that letter, President Truman spoke specifically of immigration quotas arranged deliberately to exclude specific nationalities. A large portion of the letter directly addressed Truman\u2019s belief that the American way of life ought to be extended to those living under the same totalitarian regimes the U.S. hoped to vanquish.

While the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 did include provisions for barring aliens who sought to overthrow the U.S. government by force, violence, or unconstitutional means, this does not equate to a blanket ban on Muslims. The act was not specifically targeting Muslims, but rather individuals or groups who posed a threat to the government.

But he didn't quite stay on message. Interviewer Matt Lauer began by asking Biden why the federal government wasn't closing the border between the United States and Mexico, where the outbreak began. \"\"We have contacted and been in constant contact with the leading health experts both in the world as well as here in the United States, and they have suggested that that is not the way we should move,\"\" Biden told Lauer. Lauer pressed Biden further on closing borders, saying, \"\"Let me ask this, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, I promise. But if a member of your family came to you ...\"\" \u2014 Biden laughs here \u2014 \"\"No, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?\"\" Biden: \"\"I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me. I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway. So from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing.\"\" That ended Lauer's flu questions. (His other questions were about the economy, Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch, and why Biden wasn't included among members of Obama's team named to  People  magazine's list of most beautiful people.) Within hours, Biden's spokesman sent out a statement: \"\"On the  Today Show  this morning the vice president was asked what he would tell a family member who was considering air travel to Mexico this week. The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick.\"\" We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin. The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. \"\"Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,\"\" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. \"\"The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings.\"\" We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze \"\"might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.\"\" \"\"Quite a bit of research indicates that,\"\" he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: \u2022 A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to \"\"a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis.\"\" \u2022 A 2003 study in the  New England Journal of Medicine  on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were \"\"clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft.\"\" \u2022 A 2005 study in  The Lancet  concluded, \"\"The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.\"\" That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 rubbing your eyes. \"\"If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane.\"\" If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was \"\"When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.\"\" That's just wrong. And he made the statement in the context of a highly sensitive public health matter where it's important to give the public accurate information. For fanning the flames of fear without having the facts on his side.\"","sources":"http:\/\/acer.eng.auburn.edu\/research.html, http:\/\/www.eng.auburn.edu\/users\/overfra\/, http:\/\/www.airlines.org\/news\/releases\/2009\/news_04-30-09.htm","label":2,"subjects":"National, Health Care, Transportation, Joe Biden, ","__index_level_0__":8344,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"Vice President Joe Biden went on the  Today  show on April 30, 2009, to quell concern about swine flu.

The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. \"\"Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,\"\" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. \"\"The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings.\"\" We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze \"\"might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.\"\" \"\"Quite a bit of research indicates that,\"\" he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: \u2022 A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to \"\"a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis.\"\" \u2022 A 2003 study in the  New England Journal of Medicine  on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were \"\"clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft.\"\" \u2022 A 2005 study in  The Lancet  concluded, \"\"The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.\"\" That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 rubbing your eyes. \"\"If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane.\"\" If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was \"\"When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.\"\" That's just wrong. And he made the statement in the context of a highly sensitive public health matter where it's important to give the public accurate information. For fanning the flames of fear without having the facts on his side.\"n\nClaim: When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that when one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft is false. The evidence provided from Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University explains that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet, sending particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. Research studies also support this information, showing that infections from airborne pathogens on airplanes are generally restricted to a few passengers close to the infected individual, rather than spreading throughout the entire aircraft. Therefore, the claim is false."}

The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine.

The propaganda film described in this book attempted to trace Jewish ancestry to other groups of people, most likely to demonize other cultures outside of the Aryan race \u2014 not to absolve any groups or make anti-racist arguments. An article published by the United States Holocaust Museum explained that although black people were not targeted in the same way as Jews, they were still persecuted, and Germany produced propaganda that painted black soldiers as chronic rapists and a threat to the \u201cpurity\u201d of the German race:\u00a0 The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder.

The film featured a lingering look at kosher animal slaughter, imputing sadism and bloodthirstiness to the \u201cJewish race.\u201d Jews were likened to rats and other vermin: \u201cThey carry disease,\u201d warned the narration. Such films, which depicted the Jews as a plague to be eradicated, hinted darkly at the real-life horrors to come. The propaganda film described in this book attempted to trace Jewish ancestry to other groups of people, most likely to demonize other cultures outside of the Aryan race \u2014 not to absolve any groups or make anti-racist arguments. An article published by the United States Holocaust Museum explained that although black people were not targeted in the same way as Jews, they were still persecuted, and Germany produced propaganda that painted black soldiers as chronic rapists and a threat to the \u201cpurity\u201d of the German race:\u00a0 The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups. [\u2026] Following World War I and the\u00a0Treaty of Versailles\u00a0(1919), the victorious Allies occupied the Rhineland in western Germany. The use of French colonial troops, some of whom were black, in these occupation forces exacerbated anti-black racism in Germany. Racist propaganda against black soldiers depicted them as rapists of German women and carriers of venereal and other diseases. The children of black soldiers and German women were called \u201cRhineland Bastards.\u201d The Nazis, at the time a small political movement, viewed them as a threat to the purity of the Germanic race. In\u00a0Mein\u00a0Kampf (My Struggle), Hitler charged that \u201cthe Jews had brought the Negroes into the Rhineland with the clear aim of ruining the hated white race by the necessarily-resulting bastardization.\u201dn\nClaim: A book about Hitler quotes him as saying that he would start a third world war \u2014 after his death.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"False.

{"claim_id":9245,"hypothesis":"Even partial steroid treatment can benefit extremely preterm infants, NIH study suggests","date_published":"October 18, 2016","explanation_1":"This news release by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) covers research findings on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment in pregnant women expecting preterm delivery, as published in JAMA Pediatrics. Although women likely to deliver before 34 weeks are routinely given steroid treatment to reduce the chance of complications, physicians weren\u2019t sure whether a partial course of treatment would provide the same \u2014 or any \u2014 benefits. In this new study, researchers concluded that ANS therapy was dose-dependent in providing protective effects against death or neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm infants. The release claims that even partial steroid treatment can\u00a0 benefit those born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. Details on funding sources and treatment\u2019s context are given high up in the news release. It also starts out well by providing some relevant figures, such as the number of subjects in the study, their gestational ages and follow-up times. However, other important quantitative data aren\u2019t disclosed at all, such as the extent of the treatment\u2019s benefits in the three groups, as well as the costs associated with steroid therapy. Instead, only sweeping, vague comparative language is used to illustrate complications and other outcomes, which leaves the reader wondering how beneficial steroid treatment really is. Another major point that was not mentioned was the study\u2019s limitations \u2014 namely that this was an observational cohort study that cannot establish cause and effect. Patients were not blinded to their treatments and were not randomized, which led to an unequal distribution of patients in the 3 groups in terms of socioeconomic status and other infant variables. In the end, the complete ANS treatment group already had distinct advantages from these factors in achieving better outcomes. Although studies on antenatal steroid (ANS) treatment already exist in the body of literature, there hasn\u2019t been much research looking at dose-dependent effects of ANS on extremely premature infants, especially in regard to early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Other studies have looked into partial ANS courses and rates of respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease among infants. Steroids are routinely given to pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks and are considered to be standard treatment. However, there is no clear protocol on administering ANS treatment when premature delivery is approaching, since completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours. If the latest research shows that even partial ANS treatment provides benefits to preterm infants, this should be reported to empower patients and to guide clinical practice.","fact_checkers":"Euna Bodner, MS,Dan Mayer, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"The two antenatal steroids (ANS) used in this study included betamethasone and dexamethasone, but their costs were never mentioned.

{"claim_id":9555,"hypothesis":"Botox Works As Well As Nerve Stimulator for Incontinence - Study","date_published":"October 10, 2016","explanation_1":"This news story\u00a0covers\u00a0a clinical trial that compared two different treatments for severe urinary urge incontinence in women. One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves. The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study\u2019s findings\u00a0(such as the\u00a0researchers\u2019 conclusions that\u00a0the results are of \u201cuncertain clinical importance\u201d). It also attempts to discuss cost, but provides no prices, and doesn\u2019t go far enough in detailing the potential harms of either treatment. And, because\u00a0the story\u2019s only interviewed\u00a0source has\u00a0potential conflicts of interest,\u00a0independent scrutiny was needed. Urinary incontinence is common, affecting millions of individuals, both women and men. The prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal result of aging. The condition is more prevalent in women, though beyond the age of 80, both men and women reportedly have similar rates. The kind of incontinence studied here\u2013\u201csevere refractory urge incontinence\u201d\u2013specifically means a person has an abnormally frequent urge to urinate, and it is\u00a0resistant to standard treatments.","fact_checkers":"Dave Mosher,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Joy Victory","premise":"We hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day. This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life. The closing line of the study brings this into question, i.e. how the work is of \u201cuncertain clinical importance,\u201d and good interview questions with both a study author and independent expert source could have greatly clarified the issue. Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com. And what of the harms of a neurostimulator implant? There\u2019s no mention of this, and the side effects are numerous. The story does a decent job of explaining that the study, stating it was \u201ca head to head comparison of a single Botox injection to the implanted medical device, assigning 381 women to randomly get one or the other treatment. The women were asked to keep diaries for six months.\u201d We\u2019re also told that the women had to have about 6 accidents over three days to be included in the study, and that other more standard treatments didn\u2019t help. The headline is also accurate, in terms of what the study found, and it doesn\u2019t overplay the results. In looking at the study, however, we\u2019ll note how we were struck by two things. First, the patients\u2019 reported impression of improvement in bladder leakage and function failed to pass a test of statistical significance, which undermines the story\u2019s claim that \u201cboth groups of women reported equal satisfaction.\u201d Second, the closing lines of the study point out how the treatment \u201cresulted in a small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain clinical importance.\u201d\u00a0This should have been explained to readers, along with details on what this means when researchers draw this conclusion. We don\u2019t see any language that would unnecessarily frighten a reader. The condition is real, uncomfortable, and carries\u00a0significant impact on people\u2019s daily lives. We didn\u2019t see\u00a0any backstopping of this study by an outside source. Although nonprofit websites are quoted, that material is used for purposes of background \u2014 not to assess the study\u2019s claims. Another significant oversight here is no mention of co-authors\u2019 financial relationships with the products used in both arms of the trial. (We give props to a Duke University press release about the study for pointing this out.) A quick Google search of the lead author\u2019s name and the term Medtronic reveals that she has been a consultant for the neurostimulator devicemaker, as well as for Allergan, Botox\u2019s manufacturer. We not only see a comparison to the medical device that the study focused on, but also methods that require no overt treatment, \u201csuch as weight loss, drinking less caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding lifting heavy objects.\u201d The story also notes that \u201c[e]xercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can help, as can \u2018bladder training\u2019 to accustom the body to urinating at regular times.\u201d The story could have been more clear that these treatments aren\u2019t likely to work for the women in this study who had a specific type of severe urge incontinence that is usually not responsive to exercise and other less invasive measures. Both of these treatments are widely available. But,\u00a0a description of the procedures themselves would have been helpful (they are both quite invasive and require seeing providers with special training). While \u2018regular\u2019 Botox cosmetic treatments can be easily given by various medical professionals, without specialized training, in the office, this may not be the case for Botox injections into the bladder. The story didn\u2019t establish what\u2019s novel about this study. As the news release states, the study was \u201cthe first randomized trial comparing the efficacy of two FDA-approved, third-line therapies in a severely affected population.\u201d We didn\u2019t catch any overtly copy\/pasted quotes or language that made its way into the story from the\u00a0Duke University news release.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Botox,urinary incontinence","__index_level_0__":9684,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nWe hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion.

The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day. This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life. The closing line of the study brings this into question, i.e. how the work is of \u201cuncertain clinical importance,\u201d and good interview questions with both a study author and independent expert source could have greatly clarified the issue. Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com. And what of the harms of a neurostimulator implant? There\u2019s no mention of this, and the side effects are numerous. The story does a decent job of explaining that the study, stating it was \u201ca head to head comparison of a single Botox injection to the implanted medical device, assigning 381 women to randomly get one or the other treatment. The women were asked to keep diaries for six months.\u201d We\u2019re also told that the women had to have about 6 accidents over three days to be included in the study, and that other more standard treatments didn\u2019t help. The headline is also accurate, in terms of what the study found, and it doesn\u2019t overplay the results. In looking at the study, however, we\u2019ll note how we were struck by two things. First, the patients\u2019 reported impression of improvement in bladder leakage and function failed to pass a test of statistical significance, which undermines the story\u2019s claim that \u201cboth groups of women reported equal satisfaction.\u201d Second, the closing lines of the study point out how the treatment \u201cresulted in a small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain clinical importance.\u201d\u00a0This should have been explained to readers, along with details on what this means when researchers draw this conclusion. We don\u2019t see any language that would unnecessarily frighten a reader. The condition is real, uncomfortable, and carries\u00a0significant impact on people\u2019s daily lives. We didn\u2019t see\u00a0any backstopping of this study by an outside source. Although nonprofit websites are quoted, that material is used for purposes of background \u2014 not to assess the study\u2019s claims. Another significant oversight here is no mention of co-authors\u2019 financial relationships with the products used in both arms of the trial. (We give props to a Duke University press release about the study for pointing this out.) A quick Google search of the lead author\u2019s name and the term Medtronic reveals that she has been a consultant for the neurostimulator devicemaker, as well as for Allergan, Botox\u2019s manufacturer. We not only see a comparison to the medical device that the study focused on, but also methods that require no overt treatment, \u201csuch as weight loss, drinking less caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding lifting heavy objects.\u201d The story also notes that \u201c[e]xercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can help, as can \u2018bladder training\u2019 to accustom the body to urinating at regular times.\u201d The story could have been more clear that these treatments aren\u2019t likely to work for the women in this study who had a specific type of severe urge incontinence that is usually not responsive to exercise and other less invasive measures. Both of these treatments are widely available. But,\u00a0a description of the procedures themselves would have been helpful (they are both quite invasive and require seeing providers with special training). While \u2018regular\u2019 Botox cosmetic treatments can be easily given by various medical professionals, without specialized training, in the office, this may not be the case for Botox injections into the bladder. The story didn\u2019t establish what\u2019s novel about this study. As the news release states, the study was \u201cthe first randomized trial comparing the efficacy of two FDA-approved, third-line therapies in a severely affected population.\u201d We didn\u2019t catch any overtly copy\/pasted quotes or language that made its way into the story from the\u00a0Duke University news release.n\nClaim: Botox Works As Well As Nerve Stimulator for Incontinence - Study\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Partially true and false. The evidence provided states that Botox injections for incontinence have shown to be effective in reducing the number of episodes and improving quality of life for some patients. However, there are side effects and potential complications associated with Botox injections that should be taken into consideration. Additionally, the study mentioned in the evidence did not show statistically significant improvements in bladder leakage and function, and the clinical importance of the results was uncertain. Therefore, while Botox may be effective for some individuals, it is important to consider the potential risks and limitations as well."}

This article describes a small randomized clinical trial comparing the results of weight-loss surgery (with either the gastric bypass procedure or placement of an adjustable gastric band) to dietary and exercise (\u201clifestyle\u201d) treatments to rid people of type 2 diabetes. The 61 obese adults in the study were taking either insulin or oral anti-diabetic medication, were mostly women and Caucasian, and were followed for three years. Overall, the story does a good job of laying out the benefits and goes to great lengths to put the results in context, noting in the lede sentence that this study is merely \u201cadding\u201d to the \u201cgrowing body of evidence\u201d favoring surgery over life style treatments for diabetes resolution. It also quotes those who caution readers about some limits of the study and warn against a willy-nilly\u00a0rush to the operating room. The article would have benefited from some information about the costs and potential harms of bariatric surgery, as well as details on availability and barriers to access for these procedures. Several types of surgery that essentially restrict stomach size and bypass portions of the intestine that absorb nutrients have been shown to result in long-term weight loss. These bariatric surgeries\u00a0are\u00a0not without risk, but have become increasingly popular, particularly for the severely obese. And as this new study suggests \u2014 and for reasons the article makes clear are not completely understood \u2014 the surgical treatments appear to not only significantly reduce weight, but also alter the biology of glucose and diabetic risk. They seem to do this better than lifestyle -based interventions, which often produce limited reductions in weight that returns all too quickly. Stories like this matter, not only because of the potential impact on public health, but also because bariatric surgery is expensive and has become a marketing opportunity for many medical centers and clinics. Readers need good, evidence-based reporting to distinguish help from hype.","fact_checkers":"Joann Rodgers, MS,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kevin Lomangino","premise":"The article carries no information about the cost of bariatric surgery, particularly some of the newer, more minimally invasive procedures.

Although the news release provides in-depth historical context and information on the availability of the drug, we wish it could have more critically evaluated the evidence, as well as provided more numbers to illustrate the benefit claims. A discussion on the limitations of evidence, namely how this study may have been through limited peer review, would have been useful.

It affects more than 4 million people worldwide, according to the US National Library of Medicine. About 60,000 new cases are identified each year in the United States. Although there is no cure, many of its symptoms (including tremor, slowed movement, rigidity and problems with balance) can be managed with drug therapies, the main one being levodopa.

The claim that a 150-year-old drug may provide 'off' time relief for people with advanced Parkinson's Disease is partially true because the evidence provided does support that the drug apomorphine, which has been around for 150 years, was found to reduce \"off\" time in Parkinson's patients in the study discussed. However, the evidence also highlights concerns about the drug's side effects and limitations in the study design, which raises questions about the effectiveness and safety of the drug.

Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.","sources":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/blog.providence.org\/coronavirus\/volunteers-making-homemade-masks-to-combat-shortages-caused-by-covid-19, https:\/\/www.providence.org\/lp\/100m-masks, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control\/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/infection-control\/control-recommendations.html, https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/coronavirus-interview-larry-brilliant-smallpox-epidemiologist\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27100+Million+Masks%27+--+Are+Homemade+Masks+Sufficient+for+COVID-19+First+Responders%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/face-masks.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/respirators-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/rapunzel-was-quarantined-in-tangled-google-the-name-of-her-kingdom\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-deaconess-ask-public-provide-medical-face-masks\/2865273001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/20\/coronvavirus-whole-world-responding-deaconess-face-masks-plea\/2884671001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/letters-health-care-providers\/surgical-mask-and-gown-conservation-strategies-letter-healthcare-providers, https:\/\/washington.providence.org\/about, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/natural-news-cdc-coronavirus\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeaconessHealthSystem\/posts\/10156622869747273?__cft__[0]=AZWNrouqxgFJbXaeggpz4E2RA8iOBJtkFvtemEZn4bq-hM2QI5K2E1IGUqrrCs9LhNGBN4mRzgLOh-OIyGFpI5jhdP3Xhm_rsPbfe4vOnKuYENNBdpfy3BUEB_8nnGrPF_gd1XN4qgLtXa8KhvV2sujUIxfHi1WLv3VEwkav9wASkA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1012,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn March 20 2020, KOMO anchor Mary Nam shared a photograph of a person wearing a surgical mask (a form of personal protective equipment, or PPE, known to be in short supply due the coronavirus pandemic), and put out a call for anyone who knows how to sew and has access to a sewing machine to participate in an effort to fortify COVID-19 medical supplies with homemade surgical masks:Know how to sew?

Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.n\nClaim: Homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other PPE is partially true and false. \n\nThe evidence shows that the CDC guidelines do allow for alternatives to N95s and other PPE when there is a shortage, and homemade masks can be used as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, and their capability to protect healthcare professionals is unknown. The CDC advises caution when considering this option and recommends that homemade masks be used in combination with a face shield for added protection. Therefore, while homemade masks can provide some level of protection, they are not as effective as surgical masks or N95 respirators."}

No, we\u2019re not talking about Flint, Mich. This concerns the southeast Asian city of Manila, the capital and\u00a0biggest city in the Philippines. In 1997, officials in the Pacific island nation set up not one but two private companies to deliver water to homes and businesses. One of those companies has been a financial success. So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation\u2019s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. \"\"In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent,\"\" Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose\u00a0by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore\u2019s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging. The soundest data we could find was in a 2013 report from local regulators, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took\u00a0place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate  (pesos\/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a  typical bill Typical household bill  (1997 pesos) 121 295 537  As you\u2019ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila\u2019s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization \"\"was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s.\"\" The IFC\u2019s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"\" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. \"\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\"\" Jones said. \"\"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"\" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. \"\"If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it\u2019s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,\"\" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before.

On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands. '\u201d That story reported: \u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows: In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:  The administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. So the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner. A considerable measure of truth, therefore, exists in the reports published by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Common Dreams.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":2501,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits.

Gardner Selby","premise":"\"People have increasingly crossed into Texas over the Rio Grande because they think Uncle Sam has open arms, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the other day. Cruz, at a San Antonio press conference with fellow Republicans Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, said a May 2014 government survey of over 200 people apprehended trying to enter the country illegally proves his point. Asked \"\"why are you coming here?,\"\" Cruz said, \"\"95 percent said we are coming \u00a0because we\u2019ve been promised amnesty. We are coming because if we get here, we were told that we are allowed to stay, that we will have a permiso.\"\" We wondered if most recent arrivals are citing expectations of amnesty. Record crossings Tens of thousands of people, including children mostly from Central American countries, have been crossing the border, resulting in a record number of non-Mexicans getting apprehended. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Survey says... And what was Cruz citing? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out June 2014 news stories in The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner summarizing a Border Patrol survey reportedly brought to light in an undated document Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed into the records of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a June 2014 hearing. A copy of Grassley\u2019s document, emailed to us by Texas Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s office, describes May 2014 interviews of adults and children by Border Patrol officers in the agency\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector. By telephone, Grassley spokeswoman Beth Pellett Levine said the senator knows a whistleblower summarized the interviews, though she said that as of June 24, 2014, Homeland Security hadn\u2019t confirmed or denied the document\u2019s authenticity. By email, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, declined to comment on the four-page document. According to the document, the agents interviewed 230 adults and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala on May 28, 2014. The focus, the document says, was to \"\"obtain a general consensus as to why\"\" the border crossers \"\"are migrating en masse\"\" into the country through the Rio Grande Valley. The word \"\"amnesty\"\" doesn\u2019t appear in the summary of results. Also, the document says in many cases, \"\"the subjects mentioned more than one reason,\"\" including gang-related violence, extreme poverty, high unemployment, poor living conditions and subpar educational circumstances -- with many women mentioning domestic abuse. Still, the document says, the main reason interviewed individuals \"\"chose this particular time to migrate\"\" was to \"\"take advantage of the \u2018new\u2019 U.S. \u2018law\u2019 that grants a \u2018free pass\u2019 or permit (referred to as \u2018permisos\u2019) being issued by the U.S. government to female adult\"\" non-Mexicans \"\"traveling with minors and to\"\" unaccompanied children.\"\" The document says the issue of \"\"permisos\"\" was the \"\"main reason provided by 95% (+\/-) of the interviewed subjects.\"\" The document doesn\u2019t confirm any new law and we\u2019re unaware of any. Confusingly, too, the document says the permisos are \"\"Notice to Appear\"\" documents, but it also says those documents aren\u2019t free passes to stay in the country. Rather, the document says, the notices are routinely issued to undocumented entrants \"\"when they are released on their own recognizance pending a hearing before an immigration judge.\"\" The document goes on to say the granting of permisos \"\"is apparently common knowledge in Central America and is spread by word of mouth, and international and local media. A high percentage of the subjects interviewed stated their family members in the U.S. urged them to travel immediately, because the United States government was only issuing \u2018permisos\u2019 until the end of June 2014,\"\" while several people said they\u2019d heard they\u2019d be issued only through May 2014, the document says. Most unaccompanied children, the document says, stated they were going to join a parent or parents or other family members already in the country. The children \"\"stated they wanted to take advantage of the \u2018permiso\u2019 being issued by the U.S. government to minors traveling alone.\"\" Many children cited high crime in their countries and forced recruitment into gangs, the document says, with others mentioning educational opportunities in the U.S. Outside lawyers: \u2018It\u2019s not amnesty\u2019 To our telephone inquiries, immigration lawyers who looked over the Grassley-publicized document offered different interpretations of the references to permisos. Each one also said it would be inaccurate to interpret the permisos as amnesty, as in passes to remain in the country without risk of being deported or other penalties. Elizabeth Lee Young of the University of Arkansas School of Law, who emailed us a \"\"Notice to Appear\"\" document, characterized it as an immigration court summons. \"\"Most of the people know it\u2019s a notice to go to court,\"\" Young said. Anyone who doesn\u2019t show up for their court date, she said, is subject to immediate deportation. Significantly, Young said, no one caught after crossing is given a work permit, which is how she said she usually interprets \"\"permiso.\"\" Detainees given a notice near the border, the lawyers told us, can then be held in a government facility or released deeper into the country on personal recognizance -- as children and women with children often are, the lawyers said. Toni Maschler, a Washington, D.C., attorney, said generally, she considers a permiso a permit, like a driver\u2019s license, and not the notice to appear for an immigration hearing. Maschler speculated the document\u2019s references to permisos were really to the document that releases someone on their own recognizance. Lisa Brodyaga, a lawyer in San Benito, close to the Texas-Mexico border, similarly said the document\u2019s references to permisos probably mean paperwork related to releases on personal recognizance, which she said clear the way for women and unaccompanied children to leave the border region; men, for the most part, she said, are kept in detention. Each release \"\"allows you to get out of detention, allows you to travel, it allows you to go be with your family,\"\" Brodyaga said, \"\"and, as long as you go to your hearings when you have them, it allows you to stay in the United States.

Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family.

The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. \"\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\"\" he wrote. \"\" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. \u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019 This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of \"\"Ben Carson\"\" and \"\"Pell Grants\"\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college. \"\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\"\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"\"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson.

Eugene Emery Jr.","premise":"\"Former Vice President Al Gore, now a crusader against climate change, argues that the continued release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is going to do more than just raise temperatures. It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process \"\"disrupts ocean chemistry,\"\" he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, \"\"but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years.\"\" That's important, he said, because, \"\"This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now.\"\" On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently \"\"much more acidic\"\" than it has been for \"\"many millions of years?\"\" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse\u2019s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: \"\"Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years.\"\" That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back \"\"many millions of years\"\" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that \"\"the uncertainty in the data points is very large.\"\" She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. \"\"If you go back 4 million years, you're there,\"\" Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. \"\"The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now.\"\" Again, that's not \"\"many millions of years.\"\" Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, \"\"Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today,\"\" he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off. It would have been more accurate to say, said Honisch, \"\"The ocean is acidifying faster today than it has in millions of years.\"\" Our ruling Former Vice President Al Gore said the ocean today \"\"is much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years.\"\" It's clear that the ocean is more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution. It's also clear that many millions of years ago it was much more acidic.

It's going to alter the balance of sea life by changing the acidity of the oceans. During a June 11 keynote address at U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse's 4th Annual Rhode Island Energy & Environmental Leaders Day, Gore said ocean acidification has been characterized as the evil twin of global warming. The process \"\"disrupts ocean chemistry,\"\" he said. Ocean water is still more base than acid on the pH scale, \"\"but it's much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years.\"\" That's important, he said, because, \"\"This disrupts the process by which shells are formed, not only for shellfish but also for the little critters, the zooplankton, the little tiny critters at the base of the ocean food chain. They have little thin shells. That's being disrupted now.\"\" On Sunday, we checked a similar claim from Whitehouse, who said the acidity of the oceans had increased 30 percent since the industrial age. We were equally interested in Gore's assessment of the problem over a much longer span. Is the ocean currently \"\"much more acidic\"\" than it has been for \"\"many millions of years?\"\" As we outlined in our examination of Whitehouse\u2019s claim, acidity is measured on the pH scale. The lower the number, the greater the acid level. Currently, the oceans have a pH of about 8.1. That's more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when the level was 8.2. When we contacted Gore's office, spokeswoman Betsy McManus directed us to an ocean acidification fact sheet from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She highlighted this statement, which starts out by describing that scientists measure ocean pH in ancient times by using telltale chemical signatures in tiny creatures buried in ocean sediment: \"\"Additional geochemical evidence and modeling provide strong evidence that the average surface ocean pH has not been much lower than about 8.2 for millions of years.\"\" That seems far less extreme than Gore's statement that the ocean is much more acidic than it has been for many millions of years. So we contacted several oceanographers to get data from the geologic record, where ocean pH is inferred from a variety of methods using cores taken from ancient ice and deep sea sediment. Just as you can get different temperature readings at the same time if you have thermometers in different locations, the pH measurements in any particular era and from cores taken from different locations can vary. If you look at individual data points, you don't have to go back \"\"many millions of years\"\" to find ocean levels as acidic as today. A 2009 study in the journal Science that went back 2.1 million years by analyzing the shells of single-celled plankton buried off the west coast of Africa, found that while the pH averaged around 8.2 during that period, there were a few points -- 100,000 and 900,000 years ago -- when the surface ocean pH hit 8.1, where it is today. But Barbel Honisch, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and chief author of the Science paper, cautioned that \"\"the uncertainty in the data points is very large.\"\" She said she has more confidence in data published a year later in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, which went back five million years, because it dovetails with other evidence. That study suggested that pH levels dropped to between 8.0 and 8.1 about 3 million to 4 million years ago. \"\"If you go back 4 million years, you're there,\"\" Honisch said, adding that other data support that conclusion as well. \"\"The ocean was more acidic or just as acidic as it is now.\"\" Again, that's not \"\"many millions of years.\"\" Acid levels also seemed to rise to today's level around 15 million to 16 million years ago, according to Honisch. And Andrew Dickson, an oceanographer at the University of California San Diego, said, \"\"Once we go back beyond about 23 million years, the average surface ocean pH is lower than today,\"\" he said. Another Science paper by Honisch and her colleagues, this one from 2012, looked at a broad array of evidence in 10-million-year blocks. Beginning 10 million years ago, acid levels gradually grew until the pH dropped to about 7.5 110 million years ago. That's five times more acidic than today's oceans. The climate experts we spoke with stressed that it's important to put this in perspective. Changes in pH typically occur over millions of years, giving life forms -- whose biology can be thrown akilter by a small change in pH -- time to adapt. Scientists fear that today's shift will come so rapidly, organisms won't be able to compensate, and many species will simply die off. It would have been more accurate to say, said Honisch, \"\"The ocean is acidifying faster today than it has in millions of years.\"\" Our ruling Former Vice President Al Gore said the ocean today \"\"is much more acidic, more than it has been for many millions of years.\"\" It's clear that the ocean is more acidic than it was before the Industrial Revolution. It's also clear that many millions of years ago it was much more acidic. But the best estimates suggest that the oceans reached levels of acidity comparable to today\u2019s levels sometime between about 900,000 years ago and 3 million to 4 million years ago -- far more recently than the \"\"many millions of years\"\" ago that Gore suggested. \"\"If I had one of your meters, this would be halfway up,\"\" said Dickson, one of our experts on ocean acidification.

We set out on a fact check. \u2018Apples To Oranges\u2019 Comparison? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development tracks homeless figures for each state based on point-in-time counts conducted every two years by local agencies. For 2005, HUD listed California\u2019s homeless population at 188,299, matching Newsom\u2019s figure. Last month, HUD released its 2019 report showing California had 151,278 homeless people, or about 37,000 fewer than in 2005. That also generally lines up with the governor\u2019s statement. But we found there\u2019s been a major change in how homeless people are counted since 2005. At that time, some communities, including Los Angeles County, would count the \"\"the hidden homeless,\"\" or those who were temporarily living in a motel or on someone\u2019s couch, in addition to those who lived on the streets, in cars, shelters or abandoned buildings. HUD stopped allowing the practice of counting the hidden homeless several years ago. That makes comparing past data to today\u2019s \"\"apples to oranges,\"\" said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness. \"\"It\u2019s not even close.\"\" Sharron Rapport, director of the California Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, said a significant number of people who were counted as homeless residents in the past are no longer tallied. \"\"There may not be an actual decrease of 35,000 people experiencing homeless. It could just be that we counted them differently before,\"\" said Rapport, who serves on the governor\u2019s homelessness task force. Advocates for homeless people have criticized HUD\u2019s methodology for not counting these less-visible individuals. They have said point-in-time counts, which are conducted on a single night at the end of January and largely by volunteers, tally only a fraction of the total homeless population. \"\"We know there\u2019s an epidemic, right? You would have to be blind to not understand the nature of the epidemic,\"\" Margaretta Lin, executive director of the Dellums Institute for Social Justice said in a CityLab news article in 2019. \"\"But HUD defines homelessness as people who are literally homeless. People who are in a motel for that night or couch surfing for that night, under the HUD definitions, they are not considered homeless.\"\" While the change in HUD\u2019s methodology partially explains the lower homeless population, Rapport said California is also doing a better job housing people without a permanent home than it did in the past. Los Angeles County, for example, is now housing 133 homeless people per day, a significant increase from the past, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a forum last week on homelessness. The mayor noted, however, that an estimated 150 people per day are becoming homeless in the county. A More Visible Crisis Setting the numbers aside, Rapport said there are several reasons homelessness is more visible now compared with 15 years ago. For one, it\u2019s in more communities. \"\"It used to be more concentrated in specific areas. Now it is more dispersed,\"\" Rapport said. \"\"We see homelessness in every part of our state. \u2026 It\u2019s not just in our urban centers, it\u2019s in our suburban areas, it\u2019s in our rural areas. People notice it more, I think, because of that.\"\" The high-profile Hepatitis A outbreaks that spread in homeless communities in San Diego and Los Angeles, along with more media coverage of the topic have also raised awareness, she said.

That makes comparing past data to today\u2019s \"\"apples to oranges,\"\" said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness. \"\"It\u2019s not even close.\"\" Sharron Rapport, director of the California Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, said a significant number of people who were counted as homeless residents in the past are no longer tallied. \"\"There may not be an actual decrease of 35,000 people experiencing homeless. It could just be that we counted them differently before,\"\" said Rapport, who serves on the governor\u2019s homelessness task force. Advocates for homeless people have criticized HUD\u2019s methodology for not counting these less-visible individuals. They have said point-in-time counts, which are conducted on a single night at the end of January and largely by volunteers, tally only a fraction of the total homeless population. \"\"We know there\u2019s an epidemic, right? You would have to be blind to not understand the nature of the epidemic,\"\" Margaretta Lin, executive director of the Dellums Institute for Social Justice said in a CityLab news article in 2019. \"\"But HUD defines homelessness as people who are literally homeless. People who are in a motel for that night or couch surfing for that night, under the HUD definitions, they are not considered homeless.\"\" While the change in HUD\u2019s methodology partially explains the lower homeless population, Rapport said California is also doing a better job housing people without a permanent home than it did in the past. Los Angeles County, for example, is now housing 133 homeless people per day, a significant increase from the past, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a forum last week on homelessness. The mayor noted, however, that an estimated 150 people per day are becoming homeless in the county. A More Visible Crisis Setting the numbers aside, Rapport said there are several reasons homelessness is more visible now compared with 15 years ago. For one, it\u2019s in more communities. \"\"It used to be more concentrated in specific areas. Now it is more dispersed,\"\" Rapport said. \"\"We see homelessness in every part of our state. \u2026 It\u2019s not just in our urban centers, it\u2019s in our suburban areas, it\u2019s in our rural areas. People notice it more, I think, because of that.\"\" The high-profile Hepatitis A outbreaks that spread in homeless communities in San Diego and Los Angeles, along with more media coverage of the topic have also raised awareness, she said. When we asked about Newsom\u2019s statement, the governor\u2019s office told us it\u2019s \"\"not a perfect\"\" comparison. But, they said, the federal reports are the only comprehensive source available. They added that Newsom was not trying to suggest that the crisis has improved, just the opposite. Our Ruling Newsom claimed: \"\"Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. \u2026 That\u2019s 35,000 more than we have today.\"\" His figures are technically right based on homelessness reports issued every two years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But his statement ignores a key change in how the reports count homeless people. In the past, they tallied a large number of \"\"hidden homeless,\"\" those living temporarily at a friend\u2019s home or motel. Today, those people are no longer counted, meaning Newsom\u2019s comparison is problematic, at best. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Gavin Newsom's 2020 State Of The State One year in, Gov. Gavin Newsom shows bold action, but California\u2019s homelessness crisis deepens \u2018A Real Emergency\u2019: Newsom Issues Executive Order To Use State Land, Travel Trailers, Hospitals For California Homeless Crisis A promise stalled: Eight months in, Gov.

While anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen may be useful in treating Covid-19 symptoms at home, it is important to note that the use of anti-inflammatories for Covid-19 treatment has been a topic of debate and controversy.

Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before using anti-inflammatories for Covid-19 treatment."}
