Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\" We won\u2019t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, \u00a0healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these \"\"major\"\" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. If all regulations were counted, Obama\u2019s record would be nowhere near Portman\u2019s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. But Portman said \"\"major\"\" rules.\"\" \"\"Major\"\" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them \"\"economically significant\"\" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to \"\"major\"\" that there is no need to split hairs here. We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. One was provided by Portman\u2019s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. Portman\u2019s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama\u2019s tenure with the first three of Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president\u2019s term. Portman\u2019s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. A similar analysis by George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman\u2019s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama\u2019s first term. This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman\u2019s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"\"major\"\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term.

They are calling for action to reduce BPA exposure, especially among vulnerable groups like babies and pregnant women. The evidence also shows that some European countries have already taken unilateral action on BPA, and experts estimate that BPA is detectable in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. and European population. Therefore, the claim that experts are demanding European action on the plastics chemical is true based on the evidence provided."}

{"claim_id":11422,"hypothesis":"New HPV vaccine offers greater protection against cervical cancer than current vaccine","date_published":"May 8, 2015","explanation_1":"This news release has several strengths. It carefully describes an important study comparing two forms of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and provides the reader with information on the potential impact of HPV infections. However, it doesn\u2019t deliver fully on several of our other criteria including costs, quantification of benefits, and harms. We also think that it is important from a public health perspective to discuss use of the vaccine in the context of screening programs for cervical cancer (e.g. Pap tests). While the release does mention screening, it does so only in passing. The vaccine can \u00a0greatly reduce the risk that immunized girls will develop cervical cancer in the future, but it cannot totally eliminate that risk, even when all three doses are administered. In addition, the rates of complete vaccination among eligible girls is not ideal, and a few words about the importance of completion would have added to the release. HPV infection occurs in just about every sexually active adult. In the vast majority of cases, its presence produces no lasting effects. Depending of the strain of virus and other factors, however, the virus can cause a number of genital conditions including genital cancers. A vaccine that lowers risk when administered prior to sexual activity in girls is a significant step toward reducing the burden of the disease. This release highlights the results of a study that compared two forms of the vaccine that target different HPV subtypes.","fact_checkers":"Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kevin Lomangino","premise":"The release is from the UK and likely written for a UK audience, which would expect the cost of the vaccine to be covered under the NHS vaccination program. (The release mentions that the current vaccine is covered by NHS.) However, the release does not provide any detail on what the vaccine costs per person or what the vaccination program costs NHS \u2014 which is something we think even readers in the UK would be interested in and deserve to know. For our U.S. readers, we\u2019d note that\u00a0the vaccine requires three doses and therefore three different office visits. The costs of the visits and the vaccines ($130-140 per dose) bring the total immunization cost to approximately $500. Insurance usually covers a portion of the costs, but patients may have copayments. The release headline says the new version of the vaccine is \u201cbetter\u201d than the existing version, and the study backs this up. As the release notes, \u201c\u0085Gardasil 9 was 97 per cent effective at preventing high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal disease caused by HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and was equally effective as the current Gardasil vaccine in preventing diseases caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18.\u201d But while \u201c97 percent effective\u201d sounds very impressive, what exactly does that mean? \u201c97 percent effective\u201d compared with what? The study published in the NEJM has the statistics that can put this into perspective. The paper notes the exact rate of disease that was observed in both the old and new vaccine groups: \u201cThe rate of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to [various HPV subtypes] \u2026 was 0.1 per 1000 person-years in the 9vHPV [new vaccine] group and 1.6 per 1000 person-years in the qHPV [existing vaccine] group.\u201d \u00a0For a more reader-friendly description, the release could have said the rates were 0.1 vs. 1.6 cases per thousand people in the study annually. In addition, the accompanying editorial in the NEJM rightly points to the less than spectacular successes to date in actually immunizing young and adolescent girls with three doses over 6 months. \u201cAt 57%, coverage for the first dose of HPV vaccination among girls 13 to 17 years of age lags behind coverage for other vaccines recommended for children 11 to 12 years of age by approximately 20 to 25 percentage points.\u201d Greater emphasis on the need to follow through with all three doses would have been welcome. The only mention of potential harms from the new vaccine come from a study author who says, \u201cThis is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers.\u201d \u00a0Indeed, the vaccine appears to be safe, but we think that a complete disclosure of the adverse events observed in the study would have been helpful. The conclusion in the research notes, \u201cAdverse events related to injection site were more common in the 9vHPV group than in the qHPV group.\u201d So yes, the vaccine is safe, but appears to have more issues at the injection site than the existing vaccines. This is important because not all girls carry through with all three vaccinations; the lack of follow-through may be related to pain on injection. The release notes that the vaccine has been approved by the US FDA on the basis of the study being reported on. It also provides some information about the study itself, noting that it was a \u201cclinical trial [comparing] the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, Gardasil 9, with the current vaccine, Gardasil, in more than 14,200 women aged between 16 and 26 years old. \u201d Ideally we should have been told it was a randomized double blind study and the study duration was 6 months. Some detail about the demographics of the women in the study would also have been helpful. However, we think the release provides enough information for readers to be assured of the study\u2019s overall quality. The release doesn\u2019t exaggerate the burden of HPV infection or cervical cancer. In fact, we think the release could have done more to create urgency around the need to vaccinate. The release points out that the study was funded by the manufacturer of the vaccine and that Dr. Cuzick was a coauthor of the study. The release does point out that there are two older vaccines that are available. It notes that\u00a0the quadrivalent vaccine protects against 4 strains of HPV, offering about 70 percent protection against cervical cancer, whereas the 9-valent vaccine protects against 9 strains and can prevent up to 90 percent of all cervical cancers. The release also mentions in passing that the vaccine can be discussed as part of a screening program in women ages 25 to 45. We feel that the release could have emphasized this more. The release makes it clear that the new vaccine is available in the US but not yet in the UK. The release makes it clear that the study is the first of its kind comparing two types of HPV vaccine. Quotes from Dr. Cuzik are enthusiastic but could not be described as unjustified. He says, \u201cThis is a significant achievement. The new vaccine, Gardasil 9, is not only safe but will offer greatly improved protection against cervical and other cancers. Eventually this will mean less screening is needed, as women will have greater protection from the outset.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019d add that while his statement may be accurate, the promise of the vaccine will only be achieved with higher vaccination rates","sources":"http:\/\/www.nejm.org\/doi\/full\/10.1056\/NEJMoa1405044","label":0,"subjects":"Academic medical center news release,Cancer","__index_level_0__":8988,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThe release is from the UK and likely written for a UK audience, which would expect the cost of the vaccine to be covered under the NHS vaccination program.

{"claim_id":37567,"hypothesis":"\"Players in the online \"\"World of Warcraft\"\" game were hit with an in-game virus, one that was later studied by researchers.\"","date_published":"March 9, 2020","explanation_1":"Was \u2018World of Warcraft\u2019 Once Hit by a Virus That Was Subsequently Studied by Researchers?","fact_checkers":"  Arturo Garcia  ","premise":"As the COVID-19 (aka Coronavirus disease) continued to spread in March 2020, social media users flashed back to a \u201cpandemic\u201d that unfolded nearly 20 years earlier \u2014 but this one took place entirely in the virtual world.According to the Hong Kong-based tech news site AbacusNews.com, more people on the Chinese platform Weibo have begun researching the Corrupted Blood online virus and players\u2019 responses to the bug, which broke out inside the World of Warcraft game platform (known as WOW for short) in September 2005:A Weibo hashtag related to the World of Warcraft epidemic has become one of the most-searched terms, reaching nearly 60 million views. And one Weibo influencer spotted a similarity between their origins: The Wuhan coronavirus and Corrupted Blood both started in animals.\u201cOn the fundamental level, Corrupted Blood started with a hunter\u2019s pet, namely an animal, before it transmitted to a person,\u201d the Weibo user wrote.On Twitter, author Rin Chupeco garnered attention by highlighting the incident in a very popular thread and adding, \u201cEpidemiologists actually STUDIED this to see how ppl would react to an epidemic [in real life].\u201dThe Warcraft outbreak was an unintended side-effect of an update to the game involving the character Hakkar the Soulflayer, introduced for players in the online multi-player game to take down to complete a raid. One of Hakkar\u2019s attacks siphoned off players\u2019 characters\u2019 \u201cblood,\u201d weakening them to replenish his own strength. The game allowed for players to contaminate (or \u201ccorrupt\u201d) their characters\u2019 blood and thus poison Hakkar. But the tactic could also affect characters\u2019 in-game pet.Engineers for the game told PC Magazine in 2019 that the problem originated from a mistake by the design team; if a character\u2019s pet was in play at the time they poisoned Hakkar using that maneuver, the corrupted blood effect \u2014 and damage to not only the pet but any other character \u2014 would linger even after completing that part of the game.\u201cEvery time you\u2019d summon that pet you\u2019d reinfect yourself and all the players around you and it wouldn\u2019t check if you were in a raid so you\u2019d do it while you were in town and the entire town would get corrupted,\u201d said Shane Dabiri, chief of staff for the game\u2019s manufacturer Blizzard Entertainment. The effect was further spread by players who willfully \u201cinfected\u201d their characters, and then deliberately took them to other virtual sites on the WOW platform.\u201cEven once we figured out what was going on it made it really, really hard to fix it,\u201d Cash said:Our choices were either to go through every pet in every server in every country in the entire world and check if it had corrupted blood and get rid of it, or get really hacky code in where every time you summoned a pet it would check and see if it had corrupted blood on it and get rid of it.At the time, an estimated 6.5 million players used the game platform. As Reuters would report in 2009, the corrupted blood outbreak, which lasted around a month, affected 4 million of them. But the situation also prompted researchers to take note.In a March 2007 article for the journal Epidemiology,\u00a0physician Ran D. Balicer from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel called the purposeful spread of corrupted blood by WOW players \u201cthe first virtual act of bio-warfare\u201d and drew parallels between that outbreak online and the public spread of other diseases in the real world:The role of an asymptomatic-yet-infective animal reservoir, for instance, is evident in avian influenza. Asymptomatic ducks had an important role in allowing this otherwise relatively lethal avian disease to become endemic in East Asia and spread to other parts of the world. Furthermore, attempts by game administrators to quarantine infected areas proved futile due to the ability of characters to rapidly teleport to distant lands. This is similar to the role of air travel in the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (ie, SARS).That same year, in a paper for Lancet Infectious Diseases, Tufts University professor Nina Fefferman and co-author Eric Lofgren from the University of North Carolina argued that because WOW players can be so immersed in the game, that their reactions could be used as a gauge for how non-gamers could react in the event of a real-world outbreak:The modern world has two distinct types of pathogens, real and virtual. Real pathogens are, logically, those that infect real organisms, many of which subsequently cause disease and become subject to the attentions of the medical and public-health professions. The second type of pathogen, the virtual virus, infects computers through software. The outbreak we have described marks the first time that a virtual virus has infected a virtual human being in a manner even remotely resembling an actual epidemiological event.

And one Weibo influencer spotted a similarity between their origins: The Wuhan coronavirus and Corrupted Blood both started in animals.\u201cOn the fundamental level, Corrupted Blood started with a hunter\u2019s pet, namely an animal, before it transmitted to a person,\u201d the Weibo user wrote.On Twitter, author Rin Chupeco garnered attention by highlighting the incident in a very popular thread and adding, \u201cEpidemiologists actually STUDIED this to see how ppl would react to an epidemic [in real life].\u201dThe Warcraft outbreak was an unintended side-effect of an update to the game involving the character Hakkar the Soulflayer, introduced for players in the online multi-player game to take down to complete a raid. One of Hakkar\u2019s attacks siphoned off players\u2019 characters\u2019 \u201cblood,\u201d weakening them to replenish his own strength. The game allowed for players to contaminate (or \u201ccorrupt\u201d) their characters\u2019 blood and thus poison Hakkar. But the tactic could also affect characters\u2019 in-game pet.Engineers for the game told PC Magazine in 2019 that the problem originated from a mistake by the design team; if a character\u2019s pet was in play at the time they poisoned Hakkar using that maneuver, the corrupted blood effect \u2014 and damage to not only the pet but any other character \u2014 would linger even after completing that part of the game.\u201cEvery time you\u2019d summon that pet you\u2019d reinfect yourself and all the players around you and it wouldn\u2019t check if you were in a raid so you\u2019d do it while you were in town and the entire town would get corrupted,\u201d said Shane Dabiri, chief of staff for the game\u2019s manufacturer Blizzard Entertainment. The effect was further spread by players who willfully \u201cinfected\u201d their characters, and then deliberately took them to other virtual sites on the WOW platform.\u201cEven once we figured out what was going on it made it really, really hard to fix it,\u201d Cash said:Our choices were either to go through every pet in every server in every country in the entire world and check if it had corrupted blood and get rid of it, or get really hacky code in where every time you summoned a pet it would check and see if it had corrupted blood on it and get rid of it.At the time, an estimated 6.5 million players used the game platform. As Reuters would report in 2009, the corrupted blood outbreak, which lasted around a month, affected 4 million of them. But the situation also prompted researchers to take note.In a March 2007 article for the journal Epidemiology,\u00a0physician Ran D. Balicer from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel called the purposeful spread of corrupted blood by WOW players \u201cthe first virtual act of bio-warfare\u201d and drew parallels between that outbreak online and the public spread of other diseases in the real world:The role of an asymptomatic-yet-infective animal reservoir, for instance, is evident in avian influenza. Asymptomatic ducks had an important role in allowing this otherwise relatively lethal avian disease to become endemic in East Asia and spread to other parts of the world. Furthermore, attempts by game administrators to quarantine infected areas proved futile due to the ability of characters to rapidly teleport to distant lands. This is similar to the role of air travel in the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (ie, SARS).That same year, in a paper for Lancet Infectious Diseases, Tufts University professor Nina Fefferman and co-author Eric Lofgren from the University of North Carolina argued that because WOW players can be so immersed in the game, that their reactions could be used as a gauge for how non-gamers could react in the event of a real-world outbreak:The modern world has two distinct types of pathogens, real and virtual. Real pathogens are, logically, those that infect real organisms, many of which subsequently cause disease and become subject to the attentions of the medical and public-health professions. The second type of pathogen, the virtual virus, infects computers through software. The outbreak we have described marks the first time that a virtual virus has infected a virtual human being in a manner even remotely resembling an actual epidemiological event. As technology and biology become more heavily integrated in daily life, this small step towards the interaction of virtual viruses and human beings could become highly significant.More than a decade later, those respective analyses continued to hold true; Eric Lofgren, who as of March 2020 was working as an infectious disease specialist at the Washington State University veterinary teaching hospital, told the Canadian Broadcast Company that implementing planned outbreaks within virtual settings could provide data for how to combat viral diseases outside of them.\u201cIn the real world, we can observe people\u2019s behaviour, but we don\u2019t know everything about the rest of the universe.

For readers who get all the way to the end, it will be clear that the dog-detection system is far from available now and might require technology to replicate it into a device that works accurately almost all the time. But we wish the story had looked at some other valid questions about the research: They don\u2019t provide any data about test-retest over time, or the other challenges that might exist with training large numbers of dogs over time and space. The US spends an estimated $10 billion on treatment for patients with lung cancer. It is the second most common form of cancer in the US, and the leading cause of cancer death. An estimated 220,000 people will be diagnosed this year and about 157,000 will die of lung cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. If there were a way to detect it earlier, it might add years to those lives and save the cost of more invasive testing for those who don\u2019t have the disease.

{"claim_id":34166,"hypothesis":"In October 2019, the Rev. Robert Morey of St. Anthony's parish in Florence, South Carolina, refused former Vice President Joe Biden the Catholic rite of communion.","date_published":"October 30, 2019","explanation_1":"Until and unless we receive information that corroborates Morey\u2019s account.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights. The story was covered by several major national news outlets\u00a0but originated in a statement sent to the Florence Morning News by Robert Morey, a priest in the Catholic parish of St. Anthony in Florence, South Carolina. On Oct. 28, the Morning News reported that: Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church\u2019s 9 a.m. Mass\u2026 \u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Morey told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey added. Asked by Snopes to confirm, deny, or clarify Morey\u2019s account, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment on the story. Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":7484,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights.

Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.n\nClaim: In October 2019, the Rev. Robert Morey of St. Anthony's parish in Florence, South Carolina, refused former Vice President Joe Biden the Catholic rite of communion.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Not enough information. While there is a statement from Rev. Robert Morey claiming he refused Joe Biden communion, there is no corroborating evidence or witnesses to confirm this account. Biden declined to comment on the incident, and there is no response from Morey or the diocese to provide further details. Additionally, Morey's past political contributions and disagreement with Biden on abortion rights raise questions about his potential motives. Without more information or evidence, it is not possible to determine the veracity of the claim."}

Appended pictures appear to show squares of missing hair at her hairline and the base of her neck. Also missing from the first-person account was information about whether the product demonstrated signs of tampering. Nair and other hair removal creams have a distinct, overpowering scent similar to sulfur, which is stronger still when it is undiluted.The New Richmond Police Department put out a press release saying they are investigating the incident:On July 28, 2019 The New Richmond Police Department received a complaint of alleged product tampering. A 21 year old female subject indicated she used hair conditioner, recently purchased, and upon using the product for the first time reported immediate significant hair loss on her head. The product was reported to have a different smell and color than the original product. Product tampering can be a felony offense and is cited under Wisconsin State Statute 941.327. Due to the significance of this offense, New Richmond officers and detectives have been working with Wal-Mart staff to identify potential suspects and review video surveillance. The New Richmond Police Department will continue to follow the facts of this case.While this appears to be an isolated case at this time, the New Richmond Police Department is asking anyone in this area that has been a recent victim of this type of activity to please report it immediately to your local police\/sheriff\u2019s department.The New Richmond Police Department is also reminding people to be diligent in checking products for safety seals and prior to any use to make sure it is consistent with the product you are expecting.Some news sites reported on the Facebook post as an isolated incident (\u201cWoman loses hair \u2018in clumps\u2019 after Nair was allegedly mixed into conditioner bought at Walmart\u201d), while others leapt to the conclusion that this was a trend:People Are Now Putting Hair Removal Creme In Shampoo BottlesSomeone had replaced the brand new product with Nair hair removal creme.I remember the rumors about people putting Nair in the conditioner and shampoo bottles of their worst enemies, but this is something entirely worse! Continuing into the post, she claims that she reported the incident to local police, and they are working to watch camera footage from the Walmart, to see if they can get to the bottom of the incident.Warning! People Are Putting Hair Removal Cream in Shampoo BottlesGreat, it looks like we all have one more thing to worry about. A mother is urging shoppers who purchase products at Walmart to double-check if any of the items have been tampered with before buying them. This after her daughter discovered her conditioner bottle contained Nair inside the product. Nair is a hair removal product that works by breaking the \u201cdisulfide bonds of the keratin molecules in hair\u201d which makes it easier for hair to be wiped away easily without using a razor.As the first of the two sites noted above, claims about contaminating conditioner with hair removal creams like Nair are old urban legends, which does not mean that someone, somewhere has not attempted to execute such a prank. Further, the post alludes to targeting a person in that fashion; as presented, the purported victim in the Facebook posts appeared to have been randomly selected.In the second excerpt, the site made reference to the manner in which Nair and other chemical depilatories function. In contrast with most conditioners (which sit on the hair for one to three minutes), Nair and hair removal creams sit on the skin for five to ten minutes \u2014 or even longer \u2014 to dissolve hair. On their website, Nair provides the following instructions for one product:Smooth on a thick, even layer to cover hair. Leave cream on for 5 minutes.Check a small area for hair removal. If your hair is thick, you may need more time. (Don\u2019t leave on longer than 10 minutes. )Gently wipe off the cream and hair with a damp washcloth. Don\u2019t rub!Rumors about contaminating conditioner (or shampoo) with Nair very likely antedate the internet. However, their plausibility was discussed on the Straight Dope message board back in 2001; forum members provided a laundry list of reasons the prank was impractical. It was cited other forums in undated posts, and appeared in 2010 on a forum for people with long hair. In an unrelated 2010 video, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d prank appeared on YouTube.In 2016, the \u201cNair in shampoo\u201d rumor was the subject of a viral hoax. In 2018, a Reddit user claimed a disgruntled roommate put hair removal cream in her shampoo, and that same year the likelihood of the prank working was discussed on Quora. On the latter post, a self-identified hairdresser claimed to have witnessed the aftermath of one such incident.In photographs, the woman making the claims appeared to be missing neatly bordered sections of scalp hair, not a diffuse amount throughout her scalp. Conditioner is distributed through hair, and whether strands had been shortened or unevenly dissolved was also not clear from the photographs.In the photograph on the left side of Timm\u2019s post, the conditioner is shown to be a large bottle with a pump, supposedly purchased just two days earlier. Hair removal cream surreptitiously added to the bottle in a Walmart aisle would be situated at the top and unlikely to move to the bottom of the bottle, whereas the pump would retrieve product from the bottom up. If an ill-intentioned shopper decanted hair removal cream into a very large pump bottle of conditioner, it seemed unlikely the affected product would migrate into the pump in the first day or two of use.It is also possible that the uneven distribution was due to a tampered but unshaken product, where pockets of pure \u201cNair\u201d were next to pockets of conditioner. However, massaging the product through hair ought to have diluted the \u201cNair\u201d as well, making it less efficient. Presumably, a then-diluted formula would have sat on the skin for a shorter period of time than five minutes, lowering the possibility of hairless patches.Another issue is that the articles quoted above asserted that \u201cpeople\u201d are \u201cnow putting\u201d hair removal cream in conditioner; we found no other reports of such tampering in the time period during which the reports appeared. We emailed Nair for information about the feasibility of the rumor, but have not yet received a response.In short, a woman claimed that a chemical hair remover\u00a0was added to hair conditioner she purchased at Walmart, leading to hair loss. It is possible that Nair-tainted conditioner caused the hair loss shown here, but it is also possible that the hair loss was due to another reason and that the poster assumed that unexpected loss of hair was because of product tampering. The latter issue\u00a0\u2014 product tampering in a store\u00a0\u2014 had been recently\u00a0reported, making it a possibility that news about product tampering led the woman to conclude that it had also happened to her.We found no additional, similar reports to suggest that the claim indicated a widespread trend.

{"claim_id":36856,"hypothesis":" Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign used a body double after Clinton suffered a medical episode at a 9\/11 ceremony in New York. ","date_published":"September 13, 2016","explanation_1":"Hillary Clinton Has a Body Double ","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"Rumors that Hillary Clinton has a body double are nothing but speculation at this point. The story unfolded when bystander video emerged of Clinton nearly fainting and stumbling from a curb before her aids loaded her into a van after a 9\/11 event in New York. The situation played into conspiracy theories that Clinton has been hiding a major medical condition, most likely Parkinson\u2019s disease. Clinton\u2019s doctor, Lisa Bardack, released a statement saying that Clinton had been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia during a follow up visit on Friday: She was put on antibiotics, and was advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at (Sunday\u2019s) event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.

{"claim_id":34700,"hypothesis":"\"Disputed parentage of a child born aboard a ship was resolved by listing the newborn as a \"\"son of the gun.\"","date_published":"September 7, 2002","explanation_1":"A more believable postulation for the origin of the term shifts the focus onto the occupation of the father and away from the location of the whelping (which fanciful lore would have us believe was on a deck between two guns, rather than in a cot in an officer\u2019s cabin or in a screened-off corner of the sick bay). In that explanation, \u201cgun\u201d refers to \u201csoldier\u201d (equating arms with the man, as it were), making any soldier\u2019s or sailor\u2019s male child \u2014 conceived in wedlock or not \u2014 a \u201cson of a gun.\u201d Alliteration (repetition of sounds) and well-cadenced rhymes were just as well-loved centuries ago as they are now, thus our forefathers would have delighted in \u201cson of a gun\u2019s\u201d inherent ear appeal in the same way we were slyly pleased by \u201cthe Thrilla in Manila\u201d and \u201cin like Flynn.\u201d","fact_checkers":"David Mikkelson","premise":"The faintly derogative epithet \u201cson of a gun\u201d has been documented as part of the lexicon of the English language since 1708, but no one can really lay claim to knowing how it began or what the phrase originally signified. Numerous interesting backstories have emerged in the centuries since, and it\u2019s possible one might even be the right one, but we no longer have any way of knowing. We can, however, dismiss some of the more fanciful \u201cexplanations\u201d that have come along: We can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above. First, wives and girlfriends (i.e., prostitutes) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time. Can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships, and how many extra rations they\u2019d have had to carry, if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along? And where did these women stay? There was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew (even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once), and women couldn\u2019t be out on deck where they\u2019d interfere with the operation of the ship. Were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time? Yes, some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives, but this happened infrequently at best, making the presence of non-passenger females (pregnant or otherwise) aboard sailing ships unusual. The vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard, thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women\u2019s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed. (Larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck. This is where the crew on such ships would sleep, not amidst the guns on the gun deck.) Second, we should look askance at the claim that when in port, and with the crew restricted to the ship, women typically gave birth aboard ship. Crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports, which we can fairly assume their home berths were not. And even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew (either to desertion or drunkenness) if they were let off the ship, the wives were under no such restrictions. Not being necessary to the running of the ship, nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth. Their husbands not only wouldn\u2019t accompany this hypothetical exodus, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to even if they could. In the era of sailing ships, the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now \u2014 dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on, but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere, and the farther away the better.

Numerous interesting backstories have emerged in the centuries since, and it\u2019s possible one might even be the right one, but we no longer have any way of knowing. We can, however, dismiss some of the more fanciful \u201cexplanations\u201d that have come along: We can dismiss many of the recurring elements in the four fanciful explanations touted above. First, wives and girlfriends (i.e., prostitutes) were not routinely brought along by ordinary sailors on naval vessels which were often out on a commission for months or years at a time. Can you imagine how much extra space would have to be built into these ships, and how many extra rations they\u2019d have had to carry, if all crew members brought their wives and girlfriends along? And where did these women stay? There was barely enough room below decks to accommodate the regular crew (even though only half the crew was ever asleep at once), and women couldn\u2019t be out on deck where they\u2019d interfere with the operation of the ship. Were they just all stuffed into the hold for six months at a time? Yes, some officers on some voyages were permitted to bring along wives, but this happened infrequently at best, making the presence of non-passenger females (pregnant or otherwise) aboard sailing ships unusual. The vast majority of such voyages had nary a female aboard, thus the notion that a popular phrase sprang from the common occurrence of women\u2019s so overrunning vessels that they were routinely whelping on the high seas is seriously flawed. (Larger naval vessels often included a berthing deck which was distinct from the gun deck. This is where the crew on such ships would sleep, not amidst the guns on the gun deck.) Second, we should look askance at the claim that when in port, and with the crew restricted to the ship, women typically gave birth aboard ship. Crews were usually restricted to ship only in hostile ports, which we can fairly assume their home berths were not. And even when shore leave was denied because the captain was intent upon being underway quickly and feared losing some of his crew (either to desertion or drunkenness) if they were let off the ship, the wives were under no such restrictions. Not being necessary to the running of the ship, nothing would have prevented expectant lasses from returning to their homes to give birth. Their husbands not only wouldn\u2019t accompany this hypothetical exodus, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted to even if they could. In the era of sailing ships, the role of the father during the birth process was not what it is now \u2014 dads of modern times may make it their business to be in the delivery room cheering matters on, but papas of more distant ages made certain to be elsewhere, and the farther away the better. Bringing babies into the world was considered wholly the province of women (doctors were summoned only if matters had taken a decidedly bad turn, and even then only rarely), and men were present at such events only when it could not otherwise be avoided. Men certainly did not voluntarily insert themselves into the proceedings, nor would their presence have been welcomed by the women straining to bring children into the world, the midwives attending them, and the array of female relatives that inevitably gathered by the bedside.

She stated she gave Dallas one of the bones on the night of January 4 2020, adding that her pet vomited blood overnight.After watchful waiting, Dallas\u2019 condition purportedly deteriorated and he was transported to a veterinarian for additional testing:OP\u2014>Don\u2019t buy this shit. I grabbed these at Pets Mart on Saturday thinking Blue Buffalo $40 dental \u201cbones\u201d would be good stuff (heathy, holistic, wheat free, no chemical dye) for a bit of tartar buildup. My dog Dallas had one yesterday evening (we supervised him and he chewed it up). Sometime overnight he started throwing up blood ( total was 14-18 times before the vet got it under control with meds). I initially wrote it off to a bit of gastro upset and the red in his vomit to the dehydrated beets in it. But he wouldn\u2019t eat chicken and rice and couldn\u2019t even keep water down. Then he started drooling and dragging his feet and then couldn\u2019t even stand.Needless to say we rushed him to the vet. When I looked up this brand I was shocked to find similar experiences posted online, especially in the last few weeks.He tested negative for pancreatitis. X-ray showed no obstruction (which we were fairly positive of even beforehand seeing as we watched him eat it) but it showed that his stomach is super irritated and pancreas was a bit off too. Bloodwork is all wonky cause his RBC is so high from dehydration.At that point, McDonald noted that the veterinarian\u2019s tests were inconclusive \u2014 her conclusion that Blue Buffalo Dental Bones had caused Dallas\u2019 idiopathic illness was based on information she obtained by searching on Google for complaints about that specific product. McDonald said that Dallas was infrequently ill and rarely had stomach problems, that she supervised his consumption of the Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and that she located several similar complaints from owners whose dogs had fallen ill after consuming the same product:He\u2019s staying overnight at the vet on IV fluids. Endoscopy showed a lot of damage in his stomach, too much for surgery. We will know more tomorrow. This has been a nightmare \ud83d\udc94 feels so wrong being at home without my dog and I\u2019m beating myself up for not doing my research first like I usually do \ud83d\ude25I\u2019m sharing because;1. This guy has an iron stomach and usually nothing gets to him. 5 yo and NEVER had any previous health issues or food allergies \u2639\ufe0f2. He ate ONE and it was supervised, he broke it down and consumed it properly3. If you google this brand there are eerily similar complaints especially in the last few weeks. Diagnoses I keep seeing are pancreatitis and HGE.If it saves even one person the heartache we are enduring right now then it\u2019s worth it. A higher price doesn\u2019t mean better quality or safe!ETA: If you can\u2019t share my post you might have to click the original post. It is shareable on my wall but some page settings have sharing turned off.According to McDonald, the diagnoses mentioned by other distressed dog owners were pancreatitis and HGE, presumably \u201chemorrhagic gastroenteritis.\u201d McDonald also updated to include additional anecdotal reports from dog owners whose pets became ill or died in a similar fashion. Those commenters also believed that their pets were sickened by Blue Buffalo Dental Bones (or possibly other Blue Buffalo products. )We checked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) animal\/veterinary recalls site for any complaints involving Blue Buffalo Dental Bones; the only result related to Blue Buffalo on a whole involved a 2017 voluntary recall of \u201cone production lot of BLUE Wilderness\u00ae Rocky Mountain RecipeTM Red Meat Dinner Wet Food for Adult Dogs, as the product has the potential to contain elevated levels of naturally-occurring beef thyroid hormones.\u201dThat release described a specific \u201clot\u201d of one variety of canned dog food, and a completely different and unrelated risk posed by that voluntarily recalled product:Dogs ingesting high levels of beef thyroid hormones may exhibit symptoms such as increased thirst and urination, weight loss, increased heart rate and restlessness. These symptoms may resolve when the use of the impacted food is discontinued. However, with prolonged consumption these symptoms may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or difficulty breathing. Should these symptoms occur, contact your veterinarian immediately.According to the release, it appeared that illness in one dog \u2014 not a large number, as the Facebook post implied about Blue Buffalo\u2019s Dental Bones \u2014 triggered the widespread recall. In that instance, the FDA and Blue Buffalo monitored the case, and the dog made a full recovery:Although the Blue Buffalo Customer Care Resource Team has not received any reports of dogs exhibiting these symptoms from consuming this product, the FDA advised Blue Buffalo of a single consumer who reported symptoms in one dog, who has now fully recovered. Blue Buffalo immediately began an investigation, however, and after working with the FDA, Blue Buffalo decided it would be prudent to recall the one production lot in question.An absence of reports was not due to the FDA not logging reports like the one in the Facebook post. On page 10 of 12 unlabeled consumer reports, a separate brand of dental bones were cited by a consumer as the cause of her dog\u2019s euthanization. Unlike the dog in the Facebook post, that pet had consumed many of the dental bones over a long period before falling ill:My dog began vomiting at around 7:00pm on Monday, February 4, 2013. He continued to vomit throughout the night, at least once per hour. He became very lethargic and would cry out in pain if touched. I took him to the vet the next morning when he had not improved. He was on IV fluids all day and put out < 2cc of urine, and that urine was mostly blood. The blood tests revealed that he was in complete renal failure. The veterinarian told me that he would die within 24 hours due to his complete loss of kidney function, and that my best option was to have him euthanized because he was in pain and would continue to get worse as death grew closer. Prior to this, he was a happy and healthy indoor dog. He was playful and loving, and I took care of him as if he were my child. He was on a diet of Blue Buffalo Brown Rice and Lamb formula, and he was not allowed any table scraps or other foods. I recently began feeding him \u201cDingo Dental Bones For Total Care Minis\u201d at a rate of about one bone per day or every other day. This is the only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.In the consumer-submitted report, the dog\u2019s owner described a dental bones brand separate from Blue Buffalo as \u201cthe only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.\u201d That descriptor alluded to the difficulty in pinpointing sudden and severe illness in a beloved pet, particularly dogs.More to the point, the majority of pet owner reports involving a pet\u2019s meals in the day or days before the pet fell ill were likely to include one or more prominent national brands, of which Blue Buffalo was one. Dogs could consume any number of non-food items before falling ill in the night, and the pet\u2019s owner would recall having given their pet Purina, Alpo, or Blue Buffalo just prior to their sudden illness. In that respect, narrowing down the cause of illness would be perpetually likely to involve a major brand of pet food consumed the day before the pet fell ill or died.McDonald appended several screenshots of messages to her post, which had roughly thirty images in total. Of all the times readers shared this post, that indicated that perhaps one or two dozen users contacted her with suspicions about the safety of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones or other Blue Buffalo products.The two messages visible on McDonald\u2019s main post involved complaints about dog food, but not Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. The first complaint was from a woman who urged fellow dog owners not to feed their pets Blue Buffalo brand dog food, not chews. The second was even more vague, albeit heartbreaking, containing a woman\u2019s claim that she switched her dog to Blue Buffalo \u201ca few months\u201d prior to the dog\u2019s death due to unspecified causes \u2014 not due to dental bones, nor specifically something like pancreatitis or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.It is important to remember that Blue Buffalo and similarly prominent pet food brands are fed to millions of pets in the United States on a daily basis. Pets who fall ill or die suddenly are extremely likely to have eaten a brand\u2019s pet food due to their ubiquity and necessity alone. Pets are also unable to provide their owners with information about their illnesses or diets, leading heartbroken \u201cpet parents\u201d to attempt to piece together a definitive account of what sickened their dog or cat. In these examinations, a prominent brand of pet food is almost always likely to be on the list.Brand-related pet panics typically seem to center at least first around food, an issue addressed during a different panic in 2013. During that investigation, veterinarian Dr. Stephen Ettinger noted that \u201cit is rare that their food is responsible for the illness.\u201dEttinger further pointed out that anecdotal claims often take center stage when consumers feared danger in pet products:\u201cWhen a pet is sick, pet owners often look first to the pet\u2019s food as the cause. However, it is rare that their food is responsible for the illness,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ettinger in an article published by DVM360.com, a trade publication for veterinarians. Ettinger, an academic veterinarian at Cornell University, recently commented in a ConsumerAffairs story about similar complaints involving Beneful dog food.\u201cThese statements (the consumer postings) are not backed by any scientific studies, and the conditions described in the postings are amongst the most common conditions seen in everyday veterinary practice,\u201d said Ettinger said after reviewing many of the posted Beneful reports.Veterinary hospital organization VCA Hospitals maintained a page\u00a0about hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, explaining the condition and citing \u201cdietary indiscretion\u201d as a primary cause:Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) (also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [HGE]) is an acute (sudden) disorder of dogs characterized by vomiting and bloody diarrhea. Most cases occur without warning in otherwise healthy dogs. The main and most disturbing clinical sign is large amounts of bloody diarrhea, very often bright red. Some dogs may have a painful abdomen, decreased appetite, lethargy (fatigue), or fever. [\u2026]What causes AHDS? The exact cause of AHDS remains unknown (idiopathic). It may be related to dietary indiscretion (ingesting non-food items or different foods), immune-mediated disease, toxins, or pancreatitis. Stress, anxiety, and hyperactivity are thought to be possible contributing factors in many cases.On January 6 2020, Blue Buffalo specifically acknowledged the viral Blue Buffalo Dental Bones complaint on Facebook, writing:We\u2019ve heard from many of you on the recent social posts regarding our BLUE Dental Bones. As pet parents ourselves, there is nothing we hate more than hearing of a sick pet. Thank you for reaching out and showing your concern.We\u2019ve contacted this pet parent to learn more about their pup\u2019s recent health issue and would like to assure our loyal BLUE customers that our BLUE Dental Bones undergo significant quality and digestibility testing to ensure we provide the safest and healthiest product possible. We take all customer complaints very seriously and will continue to investigate this issue.Many of the top comments came from pet owners lodging complaints about their dogs\u2019 illnesses and Blue Buffalo products. The top comment was from a user who did not mention Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, but rather \u201cproduct\u201d:Our healthy 2 year old dog spent days in the er with hemmoragic gastronitis on the 22nd after eating your products as well. Many many dogs are all having the same symptoms. All at the same time all with you being the common denominator. We are getting our food and treats tested. We will never use your products again and are warning everyone we can to never use your products! You are making dogs sick and some are dying horrible deaths!Other users referenced a completely separate set of anecdotes (regarding reported heart problems in dogs), and several commenters left well wishes for Dallas while also adding that their dogs were healthy users of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. A second commenter also referenced what appeared to be kibble, not dental bones:Now we are another customer that just got back from the vet with a dog diagnoses of pancreatitis and a very hefty bill after opening a brand new bag Sunday morning. Luckily he only ate that one meal and then threw it up within the hour and hasn\u2019t had a bite since. We thought we might loose him. Hopefully our wallet will keep him alive because you\u2019re food wants otherwise.One person relayed a story of a different product being blamed for heart issues in humans, a product purportedly vindicated after a viral controversy. And a third shared a story of a recently deceased pet, referencing similar symptoms but not any specific mechanism or product:Alarming that your dog food and treats are still on shelves. My 5 year old completely healthy fur baby showed the same symptoms on the 23rd of December, took her to the vet and she passed away on Christmas. I will never buy a single product of yours again, and I will make sure everyone I know with fur babies is aware of these incidents and hopefully will also stay away from your products.A fourth person confidently claimed that 99 percent of veterinarians do not recommend Blue Buffalo. When asked to back up that assertion, the commenter said that they were \u201cjust repeating what they heard\u201d from a single veterinarian.A highly viral January 2020 claim was one of several Facebook pet-related safety warnings, urging dog owners to steer clear of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones due to the purported grave illness of one individual dog and based on a distressed owner\u2019s Google searching. A handful of fellow dog owners came forward to report similar suspicions, but many of their shared stories involved either different health conditions or different Blue Buffalo products. The Food and Drug Administration had no information regarding a safety risk with Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and its only result among recalls was a voluntary one based on the symptoms of one dog that later recovered. Although it remained possible Blue Buffalo Dental Bones were causing illness and death, the claim was difficult to narrow down due in part to the fact most dogs are fed commercially produced dog food from a handful of national brands \u2014 including Blue Buffalo.Correction: A previous version of this story had the date of the original post as January 5 2019, not January 5 2020. We apologize for the error. -bb","sources":"https:\/\/www.consumeraffairs.com\/news\/pet-owners-blame-blue-buffalo-for-their-animals-illnesses-fda-expresses-concern-about-continuing-pet-food-issues-031213.html, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27Blue+Buffalo+Dental+Bones+Hemorrhagic+Gastritis%27+Facebook+Warning&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nikki.barker.589\/posts\/10107255556628432, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BlueBuffalo\/posts\/10156824120223359?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDOiym_N9pBBgingk2Glz25BYSjlYwwAxznqlxL_u9IjjKntbUvCzQYhnijK_IGGLyZQDrZod92dG7QbXeU8S4jus9EqloDmCKrJEYW1ji895DjC5tULZcsQq-m4MBON7FqZSDxfb7iXQjJGwfZ1NTyRfrb4dl16rlakfxkpcCEUlAdIdsAngAlXuRYQwLMTf6FtJvUoxc-OnIUZkehQKtbIgNt13pXIcL_8pD7FIXuk7Ohuo9SVO5tpx3Z-kcbAvTUUSTdPx-7jFutsaEUdKTWyhj1lxCS5TYpdJmUTj0x9NQva04SJWMQxjVcn5_5bA_3IncXjgXMmxGM&__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARAWSr919a9dLgEYOXG-gl9oRRXnaEXwLWb5fZTFUXqLfJpp8ZCAg6kgSk124Wq-8Cc9fBFk5wZrfuHwW0SIFkjMoRMXWEak2q2M_IkeSf7GkeLbgq2HhMFN44U_E754Imb_ZxeIXWfzcCPH34hTmf6Zxja5x4zWtfdk_c2XCTGLPqYiKsYt8UfA_WfKXZ4rVjXnfho-hWZF8riunV9xwqHcMJ5R1O6jJdb84BCgD-vKlZdFI39JeePWRxkz6d_rPFUMNhh-s_PojUUmol3sNK5od2-FCHAWzKzwG-YVGd5ZG6Qan_44sQ9CXBU8c5L8-1gjGc6dWWQZUEe6&__tn__=-R, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/animal-veterinary\/safety-health\/recalls-withdrawals, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/were-an-army-veterans-prosthetic-legs-repossessed-after-a-va-and-medicare-dispute\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/safety\/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts\/blue-buffalo-voluntarily-recalls-one-lot-blue-wildernessr-rocky-mountain-recipe-tm-red-meat-dinner, https:\/\/vcahospitals.com\/know-your-pet\/hemorrhagic-gastroenteritis-in-dogs, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/86880\/download, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fblue-buffalo-dental-bones-hemorrhagic-gastritis-facebook-warning%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":1,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1020,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn January 5 2020, Facebook user Nikki McDonald shared the following post about the brand Blue Buffalo\u2019s Dental Bones product, reporting that her dog Dallas was gravely injured and nearly killed after she gave him the product:In under a week, the post was shared hundreds of thousands of times.

She stated she gave Dallas one of the bones on the night of January 4 2020, adding that her pet vomited blood overnight.After watchful waiting, Dallas\u2019 condition purportedly deteriorated and he was transported to a veterinarian for additional testing:OP\u2014>Don\u2019t buy this shit. I grabbed these at Pets Mart on Saturday thinking Blue Buffalo $40 dental \u201cbones\u201d would be good stuff (heathy, holistic, wheat free, no chemical dye) for a bit of tartar buildup. My dog Dallas had one yesterday evening (we supervised him and he chewed it up). Sometime overnight he started throwing up blood ( total was 14-18 times before the vet got it under control with meds). I initially wrote it off to a bit of gastro upset and the red in his vomit to the dehydrated beets in it. But he wouldn\u2019t eat chicken and rice and couldn\u2019t even keep water down. Then he started drooling and dragging his feet and then couldn\u2019t even stand.Needless to say we rushed him to the vet. When I looked up this brand I was shocked to find similar experiences posted online, especially in the last few weeks.He tested negative for pancreatitis. X-ray showed no obstruction (which we were fairly positive of even beforehand seeing as we watched him eat it) but it showed that his stomach is super irritated and pancreas was a bit off too. Bloodwork is all wonky cause his RBC is so high from dehydration.At that point, McDonald noted that the veterinarian\u2019s tests were inconclusive \u2014 her conclusion that Blue Buffalo Dental Bones had caused Dallas\u2019 idiopathic illness was based on information she obtained by searching on Google for complaints about that specific product. McDonald said that Dallas was infrequently ill and rarely had stomach problems, that she supervised his consumption of the Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and that she located several similar complaints from owners whose dogs had fallen ill after consuming the same product:He\u2019s staying overnight at the vet on IV fluids. Endoscopy showed a lot of damage in his stomach, too much for surgery. We will know more tomorrow. This has been a nightmare \ud83d\udc94 feels so wrong being at home without my dog and I\u2019m beating myself up for not doing my research first like I usually do \ud83d\ude25I\u2019m sharing because;1. This guy has an iron stomach and usually nothing gets to him. 5 yo and NEVER had any previous health issues or food allergies \u2639\ufe0f2. He ate ONE and it was supervised, he broke it down and consumed it properly3. If you google this brand there are eerily similar complaints especially in the last few weeks. Diagnoses I keep seeing are pancreatitis and HGE.If it saves even one person the heartache we are enduring right now then it\u2019s worth it. A higher price doesn\u2019t mean better quality or safe!ETA: If you can\u2019t share my post you might have to click the original post. It is shareable on my wall but some page settings have sharing turned off.According to McDonald, the diagnoses mentioned by other distressed dog owners were pancreatitis and HGE, presumably \u201chemorrhagic gastroenteritis.\u201d McDonald also updated to include additional anecdotal reports from dog owners whose pets became ill or died in a similar fashion. Those commenters also believed that their pets were sickened by Blue Buffalo Dental Bones (or possibly other Blue Buffalo products. )We checked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) animal\/veterinary recalls site for any complaints involving Blue Buffalo Dental Bones; the only result related to Blue Buffalo on a whole involved a 2017 voluntary recall of \u201cone production lot of BLUE Wilderness\u00ae Rocky Mountain RecipeTM Red Meat Dinner Wet Food for Adult Dogs, as the product has the potential to contain elevated levels of naturally-occurring beef thyroid hormones.\u201dThat release described a specific \u201clot\u201d of one variety of canned dog food, and a completely different and unrelated risk posed by that voluntarily recalled product:Dogs ingesting high levels of beef thyroid hormones may exhibit symptoms such as increased thirst and urination, weight loss, increased heart rate and restlessness. These symptoms may resolve when the use of the impacted food is discontinued. However, with prolonged consumption these symptoms may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or difficulty breathing. Should these symptoms occur, contact your veterinarian immediately.According to the release, it appeared that illness in one dog \u2014 not a large number, as the Facebook post implied about Blue Buffalo\u2019s Dental Bones \u2014 triggered the widespread recall. In that instance, the FDA and Blue Buffalo monitored the case, and the dog made a full recovery:Although the Blue Buffalo Customer Care Resource Team has not received any reports of dogs exhibiting these symptoms from consuming this product, the FDA advised Blue Buffalo of a single consumer who reported symptoms in one dog, who has now fully recovered. Blue Buffalo immediately began an investigation, however, and after working with the FDA, Blue Buffalo decided it would be prudent to recall the one production lot in question.An absence of reports was not due to the FDA not logging reports like the one in the Facebook post. On page 10 of 12 unlabeled consumer reports, a separate brand of dental bones were cited by a consumer as the cause of her dog\u2019s euthanization. Unlike the dog in the Facebook post, that pet had consumed many of the dental bones over a long period before falling ill:My dog began vomiting at around 7:00pm on Monday, February 4, 2013. He continued to vomit throughout the night, at least once per hour. He became very lethargic and would cry out in pain if touched. I took him to the vet the next morning when he had not improved. He was on IV fluids all day and put out < 2cc of urine, and that urine was mostly blood. The blood tests revealed that he was in complete renal failure. The veterinarian told me that he would die within 24 hours due to his complete loss of kidney function, and that my best option was to have him euthanized because he was in pain and would continue to get worse as death grew closer. Prior to this, he was a happy and healthy indoor dog. He was playful and loving, and I took care of him as if he were my child. He was on a diet of Blue Buffalo Brown Rice and Lamb formula, and he was not allowed any table scraps or other foods. I recently began feeding him \u201cDingo Dental Bones For Total Care Minis\u201d at a rate of about one bone per day or every other day. This is the only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.In the consumer-submitted report, the dog\u2019s owner described a dental bones brand separate from Blue Buffalo as \u201cthe only product out of the ordinary that he came into contact with.\u201d That descriptor alluded to the difficulty in pinpointing sudden and severe illness in a beloved pet, particularly dogs.More to the point, the majority of pet owner reports involving a pet\u2019s meals in the day or days before the pet fell ill were likely to include one or more prominent national brands, of which Blue Buffalo was one. Dogs could consume any number of non-food items before falling ill in the night, and the pet\u2019s owner would recall having given their pet Purina, Alpo, or Blue Buffalo just prior to their sudden illness. In that respect, narrowing down the cause of illness would be perpetually likely to involve a major brand of pet food consumed the day before the pet fell ill or died.McDonald appended several screenshots of messages to her post, which had roughly thirty images in total. Of all the times readers shared this post, that indicated that perhaps one or two dozen users contacted her with suspicions about the safety of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones or other Blue Buffalo products.The two messages visible on McDonald\u2019s main post involved complaints about dog food, but not Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. The first complaint was from a woman who urged fellow dog owners not to feed their pets Blue Buffalo brand dog food, not chews. The second was even more vague, albeit heartbreaking, containing a woman\u2019s claim that she switched her dog to Blue Buffalo \u201ca few months\u201d prior to the dog\u2019s death due to unspecified causes \u2014 not due to dental bones, nor specifically something like pancreatitis or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.It is important to remember that Blue Buffalo and similarly prominent pet food brands are fed to millions of pets in the United States on a daily basis. Pets who fall ill or die suddenly are extremely likely to have eaten a brand\u2019s pet food due to their ubiquity and necessity alone. Pets are also unable to provide their owners with information about their illnesses or diets, leading heartbroken \u201cpet parents\u201d to attempt to piece together a definitive account of what sickened their dog or cat. In these examinations, a prominent brand of pet food is almost always likely to be on the list.Brand-related pet panics typically seem to center at least first around food, an issue addressed during a different panic in 2013. During that investigation, veterinarian Dr. Stephen Ettinger noted that \u201cit is rare that their food is responsible for the illness.\u201dEttinger further pointed out that anecdotal claims often take center stage when consumers feared danger in pet products:\u201cWhen a pet is sick, pet owners often look first to the pet\u2019s food as the cause. However, it is rare that their food is responsible for the illness,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ettinger in an article published by DVM360.com, a trade publication for veterinarians. Ettinger, an academic veterinarian at Cornell University, recently commented in a ConsumerAffairs story about similar complaints involving Beneful dog food.\u201cThese statements (the consumer postings) are not backed by any scientific studies, and the conditions described in the postings are amongst the most common conditions seen in everyday veterinary practice,\u201d said Ettinger said after reviewing many of the posted Beneful reports.Veterinary hospital organization VCA Hospitals maintained a page\u00a0about hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, explaining the condition and citing \u201cdietary indiscretion\u201d as a primary cause:Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome (AHDS) (also known as hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [HGE]) is an acute (sudden) disorder of dogs characterized by vomiting and bloody diarrhea. Most cases occur without warning in otherwise healthy dogs. The main and most disturbing clinical sign is large amounts of bloody diarrhea, very often bright red. Some dogs may have a painful abdomen, decreased appetite, lethargy (fatigue), or fever. [\u2026]What causes AHDS? The exact cause of AHDS remains unknown (idiopathic). It may be related to dietary indiscretion (ingesting non-food items or different foods), immune-mediated disease, toxins, or pancreatitis. Stress, anxiety, and hyperactivity are thought to be possible contributing factors in many cases.On January 6 2020, Blue Buffalo specifically acknowledged the viral Blue Buffalo Dental Bones complaint on Facebook, writing:We\u2019ve heard from many of you on the recent social posts regarding our BLUE Dental Bones. As pet parents ourselves, there is nothing we hate more than hearing of a sick pet. Thank you for reaching out and showing your concern.We\u2019ve contacted this pet parent to learn more about their pup\u2019s recent health issue and would like to assure our loyal BLUE customers that our BLUE Dental Bones undergo significant quality and digestibility testing to ensure we provide the safest and healthiest product possible. We take all customer complaints very seriously and will continue to investigate this issue.Many of the top comments came from pet owners lodging complaints about their dogs\u2019 illnesses and Blue Buffalo products. The top comment was from a user who did not mention Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, but rather \u201cproduct\u201d:Our healthy 2 year old dog spent days in the er with hemmoragic gastronitis on the 22nd after eating your products as well. Many many dogs are all having the same symptoms. All at the same time all with you being the common denominator. We are getting our food and treats tested. We will never use your products again and are warning everyone we can to never use your products! You are making dogs sick and some are dying horrible deaths!Other users referenced a completely separate set of anecdotes (regarding reported heart problems in dogs), and several commenters left well wishes for Dallas while also adding that their dogs were healthy users of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones. A second commenter also referenced what appeared to be kibble, not dental bones:Now we are another customer that just got back from the vet with a dog diagnoses of pancreatitis and a very hefty bill after opening a brand new bag Sunday morning. Luckily he only ate that one meal and then threw it up within the hour and hasn\u2019t had a bite since. We thought we might loose him. Hopefully our wallet will keep him alive because you\u2019re food wants otherwise.One person relayed a story of a different product being blamed for heart issues in humans, a product purportedly vindicated after a viral controversy. And a third shared a story of a recently deceased pet, referencing similar symptoms but not any specific mechanism or product:Alarming that your dog food and treats are still on shelves. My 5 year old completely healthy fur baby showed the same symptoms on the 23rd of December, took her to the vet and she passed away on Christmas. I will never buy a single product of yours again, and I will make sure everyone I know with fur babies is aware of these incidents and hopefully will also stay away from your products.A fourth person confidently claimed that 99 percent of veterinarians do not recommend Blue Buffalo. When asked to back up that assertion, the commenter said that they were \u201cjust repeating what they heard\u201d from a single veterinarian.A highly viral January 2020 claim was one of several Facebook pet-related safety warnings, urging dog owners to steer clear of Blue Buffalo Dental Bones due to the purported grave illness of one individual dog and based on a distressed owner\u2019s Google searching. A handful of fellow dog owners came forward to report similar suspicions, but many of their shared stories involved either different health conditions or different Blue Buffalo products. The Food and Drug Administration had no information regarding a safety risk with Blue Buffalo Dental Bones, and its only result among recalls was a voluntary one based on the symptoms of one dog that later recovered. Although it remained possible Blue Buffalo Dental Bones were causing illness and death, the claim was difficult to narrow down due in part to the fact most dogs are fed commercially produced dog food from a handful of national brands \u2014 including Blue Buffalo.Correction: A previous version of this story had the date of the original post as January 5 2019, not January 5 2020. We apologize for the error. -bbn\nClaim: Blue Buffalo Dental Bones pose a severe risk of injury or death to dogs, gravely injured a dog named Dallas, and led to the deaths of other dogs.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Not enough information. \n\nWhile there are claims and anecdotes about Blue Buffalo Dental Bones leading to severe illness in dogs, there is no concrete evidence or official reports to confirm these claims.

Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000.

If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000. Our ruling A chain email claimed that more than\u00a0214,000\u00a0American doctors are \"\"opting-out of Obamacare exchange plans.\"\" That is based on a survey of a select group of doctors and even the makers of the survey said it can\u2019t be extrapolated for the entire country. Further, of the doctors responding to the survey, 42 percent said they weren\u2019t participating in marketplace plans because they were never asked to, not because they were \"\"opting out.\"\" The estimate is the result of a flawed methodology and a misreading of survey data.\"n\nClaim: Over 214,000 doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that over 214,000 doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges is false. The evidence provided shows that the number was based on a flawed methodology and a misreading of survey data. The survey used to come up with this number was not representative of all doctors in the country, and many doctors were not asked to participate in marketplace plans rather than actively choosing to opt out.

He told us by email that he was referring to a June 5, 2013, verdict that got national news coverage, in which a San Antonio jury acquitted a man of murder in the death of an escort he hired from an online advertisement. San Antonio Express-News and KSAT-TV news reports on the trial said defendant Ezekiel Gilbert testified that he had found Lenora Ivie Frago\u2019s ad on Craigslist and believed sex was included in her $150 fee.

He later switched to saying it is \"\"one way\"\" to view the decision. Legal experts and Gilbert\u2019s defense lawyer disagreed with him. Bobby Barrera, a defense lawyer for Gilbert, said Reich \"\"is flat wrong and not even arguably close to accurate on the interpretation of the law.\"\" The law in question is state Penal Code Title 2, Chapter 9, Section 42, which says using deadly force to protect one\u2019s property is justified in limited circumstances, including when the person \"\"reasonably believes\"\" such force is necessary to prevent imminent \"\"theft during the nighttime\"\" or \"\"criminal mischief during the nighttime.\"\" Jurors concluded that the \"\"theft\"\" justification applied in this case, Barrera told us by phone, because testimony indicated Frago and her driver had a history of taking money from clients who believed they would receive sex in return. \"\"She was committing a scam,\"\" he said. Even then, Barrera said, the jury had to find other conditions were met, such as requirements that Gilbert reasonably believed he couldn\u2019t get his money back any other way or without risking injury to himself. \"\"It is not open season on prostitutes\"\" or thieves in Texas, Barrera said. \"\"This has gone, as you know, viral with \u2018It\u2019s legal to shoot prostitutes in Texas,\u2019 \u2018Stupid Texans and their guns,\u2019 \"\" he said. \"\"Nobody wanted to know the truth; they just wanted to conclude what they wanted.\"\" As to shooting someone for committing a public nuisance, Barrera said, \"\"You cannot under any circumstances do so.\"\" University of Texas law professor George Dix, who specializes in criminal law, told us by email, \"\"Reich, in my view, is simply wrong.\"\" Frago and Gilbert\u2019s transaction would be theft, Dix said, if Frago did not intend to provide sex at the time she made the agreement with Gilbert. \"\"What would make this criminal and not merely a civil contract dispute is the misrepresentation by which Frago obtained the money,\"\" he said. \"\"In fact, anyone with a basic knowledge of theft law would understand that this could have been theft rather than \u2018just\u2019 a contractual dispute,\"\" Dix said. \"\"It could be theft under Section 31.02 of the Penal Code if the deceased promised to provide sex for the payment and at that time did not intend to provide that sex if she was paid.\"\" Even so, he said, \"\"The jury might not have been convinced this actually was theft, but also convinced the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it was not theft.\"\" That\u2019s two legal eagles saying that, contrary to Reich\u2019s assertion, the jury didn\u2019t have to consider prostitution as a reason for justifying deadly force.

Even if the offense were serious, he said, a jury would have to decide that other conditions were met. To justify deadly force in protecting a third person\u2019s property -- namely, the overpass -- the damage being halted must be so extreme it could never be repaired; the shooter must have no other way to stop the spraypainter without risking injury and must have reasonably believed deadly force was the only way to stop the spraypainter.

A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It\u2019s another thing to say what state Rep. William \"\"Billy\"\" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically \"\"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are the \"\"most polluted\"\" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. \"\"There are so many things that \u2018pollute\u2019 our rivers \u2014 GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,\"\" Raabe said. \"\"The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity.\"\" Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. \"\"The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,\"\" Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn\u2019t have a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) \"\"does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,\"\" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with \u2013 including the\u00a0Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA \u2013\u00a0echoed Raabe in saying it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina\u00a0Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. \"\"Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends,\"\" Marraccini wrote in an email. Through Google searches, PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the \"\"top five most polluted.\"\" Our ruling Richardson said that N.C. is home to two of the \"\"top five\"\" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers \"\"most endangered\"\" list \u2013 but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim.

Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically \"\"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are the \"\"most polluted\"\" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. \"\"There are so many things that \u2018pollute\u2019 our rivers \u2014 GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,\"\" Raabe said. \"\"The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity.\"\" Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. \"\"The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,\"\" Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn\u2019t have a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) \"\"does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,\"\" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with \u2013 including the\u00a0Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA \u2013\u00a0echoed Raabe in saying it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina\u00a0Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. \"\"Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends,\"\" Marraccini wrote in an email. Through Google searches, PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the \"\"top five most polluted.\"\" Our ruling Richardson said that N.C. is home to two of the \"\"top five\"\" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers \"\"most endangered\"\" list \u2013 but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim. There\u2019s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms\u00a0but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate. However, PolitiFact found no basis for Richardson\u2019s claim that North Carolina rivers rank among the top five most polluted in the United States.\"n\nClaim: \"North Carolina is home to\u00a0\"\"two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers\"\" in the U.S.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"False. \n\nBased on the evidence provided, there is no definitive list or ranking by a reputable organization that supports the claim that North Carolina is home to two of the top five most polluted rivers in the U.S. While the Neuse and Cape Fear rivers are facing significant pollution issues, there is no specific ranking or list that places them in the top five most polluted rivers in the country."}
{"claim_id":10255,"hypothesis":"Study Finds Single, Escalated Dose of Brachytherapy Radiation May Be a Safe and Effective Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer","date_published":"March 3, 2017","explanation_1":"This news release from a professional society of radiation oncologists summarizes a trial in 58 men with Stage 1 localized prostate cancer that found using a single treatment of\u00a0high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (where radioactive implants are inserted directly into the tissue) may be an acceptable and safe alternative to typical longer, but lower doses of radiation. Recognizing\u00a0that a higher dose, single radiation treatment could be more toxic to tissues surrounding the prostate, this trial set out to measure the effectiveness and safety of such treatment. While the research was non-randomized, its generally positive tone was balanced by\u00a0emphasizing that there needs to be additional follow-up research to see how it compares with conventional approaches. After stating in the headline the treatment \u201cmay be safe and effective,\u201d the release provides a fairly detailed description of harms. A concern with this study is that nearly all of the patient volunteers would have been candidates for active surveillance\u2013meaning that they did not need an active treatment. With no caveat that expert guidelines recommend surveillance for low-risk Stage 1 prostate cancers, this release engages in disease-mongering. It is recognized that exposure to radioactive treatments can be harmful and so finding other ways to treat tumors in the prostate should be welcomed. If a treatment for localized prostate cancer which is\u00a0administered in a single procedure, is equally effective and safe as conventional treatment, it is possible that patients may have fewer side effects and adverse events related to their prostate cancer treatment. This\u00a0study provides some\u00a0data on the safety and tolerability of the single dose of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy compared to\u00a0LDR brachytherapy, \u00a0It is important to note that these patients were a very select sample of prostate cancer patients (low to intermediate risk) and so extrapolating those findings to other prostate cancer patients may not be appropriate.","fact_checkers":"Alan Cassels,Richard Hoffman, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"There was zero mention of cost, which is unfortunate because presumably a single treatment would entail fewer costs than one that involved multiple procedures. The main benefit focused on a vaguely described \u201cbiochemical progression,\u201d which means that there was some evidence that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels increased. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Determining PSA progression is more complicated following radiation because it takes time for the PSA level to stabilize (unlike following surgery to remove the prostate) before you can determine whether the PSA is rising. Biochemical progression is also a surrogate measure and does not imply that the cancer is\u2013or will\u2013clinically progress. The researchers did acknowledge that the actual benefits are unknown, saying that \u201cas the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards.\u201d The release provided detailed information on harms: \u201cWithin the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency\/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.\u201d But given that many oncology experts would consider the treatment unnecessary, any level of toxicity\u00a0could be considered unacceptable. The lay reader would have benefited from a description of what \u201cgrade 2 or grad 3+\u201d levels of toxicity means. There were a few issues that could have been clarified: the fact that these men were quite low risk to start with, that five of the initial patients dropped out of the study (and we aren\u2019t told why) and that this was a non-randomized, prospective clinical trial which is potentially subject to a series of biases. The key takeaway is that this evidence does not establish the superiority of this approach to any other radiotherapy, any active treatment, or active surveillance. The quote from a study author at the end of the release indicating that more research was required and this study was not definitive proof of the superiority of the 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy was a welcome caution, and somewhat at odds with the overall positive tone of the release. Promoting brachytherapy radiation for treatment of low-risk men is a form of disease-mongering, particularly since there is no mention of the surveillance option. The American Urological Association (AUA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that men with low-risk cancers be offered active surveillance.

The news release suggests that this is a new strategy based on new research but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. According to UpToDate, an evidence-based list of practice recommendations published by Wolters Kluwer, use of single, high dose brachytherapy for prostate cancer is not novel: \u201cThe HDR brachytherapy dose is usually administered in one to four large dose fractions over a period of time, typically 24 to 40 hours.

The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women. This is not the first time a discovery of human remains with elongated skulls sparked the hopes of UFO enthusiasts. A 2015 discovery of a prehistoric woman in Russia, at a site known as Arkaim or \u201cRussia\u2019s Stonehenge,\u201d with a similar deformity also created a buzz: Some believe that the skull\u2019s high forehead is characteristic of the so-called \u201calien grey\u201d often depicted as large-eyed and large-foreheaded beings in sci-fi films and even hoaxes. Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to. While both English and Spanish-language web sites have published pages of credulous stories about Foerster\u2019s \u00a0\u201cdiscovery,\u201d the Spanish-language skeptics blog Marcianitas Verdes notes: The Paracas culture was one of the ancient Andean villages that practiced skeletal modification. They wrapped\u00a0their babies\u2019 heads with rope, cloths and wooden boards in order to lengthen their skulls. This was done for spiritual or religious reasons, and scholars believe that it was an effort to look more like their deities. The web site delves into what may have caused the vague genetic abnormality supposedly found by Foerster\u2019s investigation: At best it is not conclusive. DNA was identified as human, but with abnormalities; Anomalies that could be caused by any number of contaminants or defects in the process.

Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to. While both English and Spanish-language web sites have published pages of credulous stories about Foerster\u2019s \u00a0\u201cdiscovery,\u201d the Spanish-language skeptics blog Marcianitas Verdes notes: The Paracas culture was one of the ancient Andean villages that practiced skeletal modification. They wrapped\u00a0their babies\u2019 heads with rope, cloths and wooden boards in order to lengthen their skulls. This was done for spiritual or religious reasons, and scholars believe that it was an effort to look more like their deities. The web site delves into what may have caused the vague genetic abnormality supposedly found by Foerster\u2019s investigation: At best it is not conclusive. DNA was identified as human, but with abnormalities; Anomalies that could be caused by any number of contaminants or defects in the process. It could be that this DNA actually provides unusual results, but the only thing that can be said about it at this point is that it requires more study. The sensational launch of unconfirmed and unverifiable information like this on a radio show is not worthy of the attention this story is receiving.n\nClaim: Cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien, not human, origin.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien, not human, origin is false. The evidence provided clearly states that the elongated shape of the skulls is most likely due to a practice known as \"artificial cranial deformation,\" which has been practiced in various cultures for centuries. Additionally, the DNA tests conducted on the skulls concluded that the samples contained human DNA with abnormalities, which could be attributed to contaminants or defects in the process. Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that the skulls are of alien origin."}

Wade case legalized abortion, it remains an emotionally-charged debate. It was against that backdrop that Dr. Patrick Johnston, the director of Personhood Ohio and a \u00a0leader of the effort to get the so-called \"\"Personhood\"\" issue on the Ohio ballot, began his remarks on Cleveland public radio on Jan. 30 with a statement. At the outset of his remarks, Johnston referred to abortion as \"\"the most common surgery in our country.\"\" The statement became the launching point for the Zanesville-area doctor to make his case that abortions have become too routine and for why Ohioans should back a rewriting of the Ohio Constitution so that a fertilized egg is defined as a person -- a change that effectively would outlaw abortion. Johnston\u2019s claim seemed like the kind of straightforward assertion that Politifact Ohio can dig into while steering clear of the moral questions that surround the divisive issue. We began by checking with Johnston to see where he got his numbers on abortion, and the frequency of other procedures. He directed us to the website for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, as the source for his abortion numbers\u2014they count about 1.21 million abortions in 2008. He also pointed us to several websites for gall bladder surgery, which assert that the procedure is one of the most common surgeries in the United States with about 500,000 patients a year. The Guttmacher Institute numbers for abortions were much higher than those we found from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported about 828,000 abortions in 2007. However, the CDC numbers are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions done in California, Maryland and New Hampshire \u2014 three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary. Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman with the Guttmacher Institute, said her group\u2019s numbers include all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports. Over the past several years, the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s estimated number of abortions in the United States have basically held steady going from 1,206,200 in 2005 to 1,212,350 in 2008. But are there more common forms of surgery? The federal CDC keeps close tabs on what people are discharged from hospitals for based on a pair of national annual surveys, one for inpatient and one for outpatient clients. By far, the most common form of surgery in 2006 was eye surgery for cataracts. There were about 5.63 million eye surgeries that involved either removing or replacing the eye lens, according to the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (the latest outpatient survey available). There were about 1.4 million endoscopic polypectomies, which involves the removal of presumed pre-cancerous lesions such as polyps on the colon, according to the outpatient numbers. Meanwhile, there were about 1.34 million Caesarean sections where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman\u2019s abdomen, according to the 2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey (the latest inpatient survey available). Abortion would rank fourth behind that trio in most common surgeries. But are they all examples of surgery or could they be considered just medical procedures? We spoke with Dr. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, and she said that while the term surgery isn\u2019t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered \"\"surgery.\"\" Keder said that eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries. Additionally, we should note here that because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures -- almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 in the United States -- that virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was much more common than abortions. There were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list. Johnston , while trying to make his case that abortion has become too routine, told a Cleveland radio audience that abortion was \"\"the most common surgery in this country.\"\" He\u2019s not even close. The most comprehensive abortions statistics show about 1.21 million abortions a year in the United States. But annual surveys show there are about 5.63 million eye surgeries involving the removal or replacement of the lens in the eye. That procedure occurs more than four times as often as abortion. And abortion didn\u2019t rank No. 2 or No. 3. There were about 1.4 million cases where presumed per-cancerous polyps were removed from inside a patient\u2019s body the year of the most recent outpatient survey numbers available.

Is it true that Clinton \"\"believes all abortions should be legal even on the due date\"\"? The Rubio campaign didn\u2019t get back to us. So we looked at comments Clinton made on the issue over the past 15 years. Clinton has said she could support restrictions on abortions in the third trimester (about week 28 of a pregnancy) if the mother\u2019s life and health are taken into account. Rubio casts this position as the equivalent of supporting abortions on the due date, but that exaggerates Clinton\u2019s position. Restricting late-term abortions Clinton responded to Rubio\u2019s attack the morning after the debate, calling it \"\"pretty pathetic.\"\" \"\"I think that the life and health of the mother, obviously, rape and incest, have to be always taken into account,\"\" she said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \"\"And, you know, when he raises the very, very difficult issue of late-term abortion, he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons, there are health-related reasons.\"\" We found many instances of Clinton saying abortion should be \"\"safe, legal and rare.\"\" In short, Clinton is open to restrictions on late-term abortions provided there are exceptions for the life and health of the mother. This includes both mental health\u00a0and medical complications like preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of high blood pressure that could lead to death. We should note that those who want a total abortion ban \u2014 a position that Rubio has expressed \u2014 see exceptions made for rape, incest and health as loopholes that undermine late-term restrictions. Advocating for exceptions could theoretically encompass a due-date abortion, but Rubio\u2019s conclusion that Clinton supports due-date abortions is not backed by evidence and logically unsound. Here\u2019s a sampling of comments Clinton's made in the past: Sept. 28, 2015,\u00a0Meet the Press Daily: \"\"There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.\"\" June 4, 2007,\u00a0Democratic presidential forum: \"\"What I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare. And, by rare, I mean rare.\"\" Oct. 8, 2000,\u00a0New York Senate debate: \"\"I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I\u2019ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it\u2019s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman\u2019s choice.\"\" When abortions can be performed According to the reproductive health nonprofit, the Guttmacher Institute, 20 states limit abortions after \"\"viability\"\" (which refers to the point when a fetus can survive out of the womb) and 23 states prohibit abortions between 20 and 28 weeks. Seven states and Washington D.C., have no time restrictions, but this doesn\u2019t mean late-term abortions are common. In fact, only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute. \"\"People say we should place legal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester. The reality is the medical community is doing that in practice,\"\" said Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco and an advisor at Ibis Reproductive Health. \"\"Third-trimester abortion is very uncommon.\"\" As for the scenario Rubio is suggesting \u2014 an abortion performed on the due date to save the life of the mother? It doesn\u2019t exist. \"\"Nobody would talk about abortion on the woman\u2019s due date. If the mother\u2019s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives,\"\" Grossman said. \"\"Medically, it does not compute.\"\" Our ruling Rubio said Clinton \"\"believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\"\" Clinton does not believe that all abortion should be legal.

Here\u2019s a sampling of comments Clinton's made in the past: Sept. 28, 2015,\u00a0Meet the Press Daily: \"\"There can be restrictions in the very end of the third trimester, but they have to take into account the life and health of the mother.\"\" June 4, 2007,\u00a0Democratic presidential forum: \"\"What I have tried to both talk about and reach out about over the last many years, going back, really, at least 15 years, in talking about abortion being safe, legal, and rare. And, by rare, I mean rare.\"\" Oct. 8, 2000,\u00a0New York Senate debate: \"\"I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I\u2019ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it\u2019s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman\u2019s choice.\"\" When abortions can be performed According to the reproductive health nonprofit, the Guttmacher Institute, 20 states limit abortions after \"\"viability\"\" (which refers to the point when a fetus can survive out of the womb) and 23 states prohibit abortions between 20 and 28 weeks. Seven states and Washington D.C., have no time restrictions, but this doesn\u2019t mean late-term abortions are common. In fact, only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute. \"\"People say we should place legal restrictions on abortion in the third trimester. The reality is the medical community is doing that in practice,\"\" said Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco and an advisor at Ibis Reproductive Health. \"\"Third-trimester abortion is very uncommon.\"\" As for the scenario Rubio is suggesting \u2014 an abortion performed on the due date to save the life of the mother? It doesn\u2019t exist. \"\"Nobody would talk about abortion on the woman\u2019s due date. If the mother\u2019s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives,\"\" Grossman said. \"\"Medically, it does not compute.\"\" Our ruling Rubio said Clinton \"\"believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\"\" Clinton does not believe that all abortion should be legal. Instead, she\u2019s said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother\u2019s life and health are in danger. That\u2019s not the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions \"\"even on the due date\"\" of the child. Such an abortion would be\u00a0a purely hypothetical scenario; doctors said such a procedure doesn't make sense medically.\"n\nClaim: \"Marco Rubio Says Hillary Clinton \"\"believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that Hillary Clinton believes all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of the unborn child, is false. The evidence provided shows that Clinton has stated she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases where the mother's life and health are at risk. She has also consistently stated that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, not completely unrestricted. Additionally, medical experts have stated that performing an abortion on the due date to save the mother's life is not a medically sound scenario. Therefore, the claim is false based on the evidence provided."}

Lehmann told PolitiFact that her opinion pieces listing Trump quotes were first created to keep track of what the president said, like a \"\"time capsule,\"\" and didn\u2019t have any partisan intent. Lehmann\u2019s two opinion pieces with the \"\"gratitude\"\" Trump quote were published two months apart. The July 14 opinion piece stated the quote was from July 13. The May 12 opinion piece repeated the same quote, saying it was from May 7. Trump didn\u2019t say this quote at any public appearances on these days. He also didn\u2019t tweet it. Lehmann explained in a phone call that she usually tracks tweets and that she may have published the quote twice if it was retweeted. Now she can\u2019t find the quote anywhere except on a \"\"great quotes\"\" page. On July 22, Jacky Smith, the Hearst editorial page editor, told us that a clarification was issued in The Norwalk Hour and The News-Times that they \"\"have been unable to confirm this quote.\"\" Our ruling The Facebook post claims Trump asked for \"\"gratitude\"\" for how he has dealt with COVID-19 and said \"\"maybe a big \u2018thank you Mr. President\u2019 is called for.\"\" The quote originates from two opinion pieces that attribute the quote to two different dates.

In response to these misleading and sensationalist reports, the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT took the step of directly refuting the \u201cmental health issue\u201d claim in a statement posted on the school\u2019s web site: The MasculinUT program does not treat masculinity as a \u201cmental health issue,\u201d and any such statements are simply not accurate.

Based on the promotional material and information on the MasculinUT web site, the closest the program\u2019s designers came to \u201ctreating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d was one section which listed \u201cemotional and mental health problems\u201d as one of four or five possible negative consequences of \u201cespousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity\u201d: Attending to masculinity can illuminate many important issues and take us a step closer to creating a dialogue for gender equity.

The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine. This definition of masculinity also restricts what is acceptable in terms of appearance. This also makes it exclusionary, because a restrictive definition of masculinity depends on excluding people from that definition.

Students who feel targeted are also at risk of engaging in violent behavior in an attempt to not be the target of violence. Restricting the definition of masculinity can turn students into \u201cpressure cookers,\u201d where if a student is not allowed to express all of their emotions and thoughts, these just build up and can explode in various, unhealthy ways (such as violent behavior or coping mechanisms such as drinking).

Carson hasn\u2019t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated. Overall, the meme is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.","fact_checkers":"Katie Sanders","premise":"\"With Ben Carson officially in the ring of Republican presidential contenders, Democratic social media activists are using his famous scraps-to-scalpel narrative against him. Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family. The Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"\"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\" \"\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. \"\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\" A reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. \"\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\"\" he wrote. \"\" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. \u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019 This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of \"\"Ben Carson\"\" and \"\"Pell Grants\"\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college. \"\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\"\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"\"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson\u2019s \"\"family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,\"\" but didn\u2019t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson\u2019s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson\u2019s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson\u2019s past and his plans if elected president. Carson has said he wants to eliminate government dependency, but he also has made clear he intends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them. Carson hasn\u2019t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated.

Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family. The Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"\"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\" \"\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. \"\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\" A reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year.

But these models don\u2019t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey is pushing for.","fact_checkers":"Jessica Calefati","premise":"\"U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready \u2013 even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,\"\" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week\u2019s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday \u2013 about 23,000 \u2013 was also well below last week\u2019s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it\u2019s time to reopen the economy in \"\"a gradual and safe way,\"\" Kelly said. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it\u2019s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don\u2019t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey and other Republicans are pushing for. Hospital capacity will be tested again once social distancing ends, and a new Washington Post analysis shows that in many parts of the country, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, it won\u2019t hold up. A team of Post reporters analyzed the availability of critical care resources across the country using data sets assembled by Definitive Healthcare, an analytics company that mines government filings, including those of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as commercial insurance claims. Imagining a scenario where the coronavirus infects two in 10 adults over the next year, the reporters found a patchwork of possible preparedness shortcomings in cities and towns where the full force of the virus has yet to hit and where people may not be following isolation and social distancing orders. The Post determined that more than half of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients. Parts of Pennsylvania that border Maryland and Ohio would fall especially short, the Post found. Making the case to reopen the nation\u2019s economy, Toomey said, \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections.\"\" Data on coronavirus case counts and fatalities show that the country\u2019s outbreak is subsiding.

Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready \u2013 even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,\"\" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week\u2019s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday \u2013 about 23,000 \u2013 was also well below last week\u2019s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it\u2019s time to reopen the economy in \"\"a gradual and safe way,\"\" Kelly said. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it\u2019s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don\u2019t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey and other Republicans are pushing for. Hospital capacity will be tested again once social distancing ends, and a new Washington Post analysis shows that in many parts of the country, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, it won\u2019t hold up. A team of Post reporters analyzed the availability of critical care resources across the country using data sets assembled by Definitive Healthcare, an analytics company that mines government filings, including those of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as commercial insurance claims. Imagining a scenario where the coronavirus infects two in 10 adults over the next year, the reporters found a patchwork of possible preparedness shortcomings in cities and towns where the full force of the virus has yet to hit and where people may not be following isolation and social distancing orders. The Post determined that more than half of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients. Parts of Pennsylvania that border Maryland and Ohio would fall especially short, the Post found. Making the case to reopen the nation\u2019s economy, Toomey said, \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections.\"\" Data on coronavirus case counts and fatalities show that the country\u2019s outbreak is subsiding. But Toomey\u2019s comments don\u2019t account for what will happen once social distancing ends.

The evidence also indicates that once social distancing ends, hospital capacity will be tested again and some areas, including parts of Pennsylvania, may be at risk of being overrun by the virus.

{"claim_id":9083,"hypothesis":"Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit","date_published":"October 6, 2017","explanation_1":"Editor\u2019s note: On the day this\u00a0 review was published, the news release it\u2019s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke. Figuring out ways to persuade them to stop has merit.","fact_checkers":"Sharon Dunwoody, PhD,Karen Carlson, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"It is not made clear what costs would accompany this kind of mobile health message strategy, and whether the costs would be absorbed by health plans and health care providers that use the service, or by individual patients.

It\u2019s assumed there is profit motive, given the licensing agreement. The release appropriately describes the outcomes in absolute terms. For example, \u201c16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby.\u201d But while the body of the release clarifies that this difference between groups was not statistically significant, the headline and lead sentence gloss over this fact.

Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.","sources":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/blog.providence.org\/coronavirus\/volunteers-making-homemade-masks-to-combat-shortages-caused-by-covid-19, https:\/\/www.providence.org\/lp\/100m-masks, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control\/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/infection-control\/control-recommendations.html, https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/coronavirus-interview-larry-brilliant-smallpox-epidemiologist\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27100+Million+Masks%27+--+Are+Homemade+Masks+Sufficient+for+COVID-19+First+Responders%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/face-masks.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/respirators-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/rapunzel-was-quarantined-in-tangled-google-the-name-of-her-kingdom\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-deaconess-ask-public-provide-medical-face-masks\/2865273001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/20\/coronvavirus-whole-world-responding-deaconess-face-masks-plea\/2884671001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/letters-health-care-providers\/surgical-mask-and-gown-conservation-strategies-letter-healthcare-providers, https:\/\/washington.providence.org\/about, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/natural-news-cdc-coronavirus\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeaconessHealthSystem\/posts\/10156622869747273?__cft__[0]=AZWNrouqxgFJbXaeggpz4E2RA8iOBJtkFvtemEZn4bq-hM2QI5K2E1IGUqrrCs9LhNGBN4mRzgLOh-OIyGFpI5jhdP3Xhm_rsPbfe4vOnKuYENNBdpfy3BUEB_8nnGrPF_gd1XN4qgLtXa8KhvV2sujUIxfHi1WLv3VEwkav9wASkA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1012,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn March 20 2020, KOMO anchor Mary Nam shared a photograph of a person wearing a surgical mask (a form of personal protective equipment, or PPE, known to be in short supply due the coronavirus pandemic), and put out a call for anyone who knows how to sew and has access to a sewing machine to participate in an effort to fortify COVID-19 medical supplies with homemade surgical masks:Know how to sew?

A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.n\nClaim: Homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"The claim that homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other PPE is partially true and false. \n\nThe evidence shows that the CDC guidelines do allow for alternatives to N95s and other PPE when there is a shortage, and homemade masks can be used as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, and their capability to protect healthcare professionals is unknown. The CDC advises caution when considering this option and recommends that homemade masks be used in combination with a face shield for added protection. Therefore, while homemade masks can provide some level of protection, they are not as effective as surgical masks or N95 respirators."}

Rather, the frequency of eligibility reviews would increase, thus discovering ineligibility sooner and more frequently.\"","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In December 2019, readers asked us about reports that claimed the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had proposed changes to the way Social Security disability payments are made, which could cause thousands, even hundreds of thousands, to lose their benefits. On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands. '\u201d That story reported: \u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows: In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:  The administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. So the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner.

One expert estimates campaigns could dole out nearly a half billion dollars to influence the fate of the dozen or more initiatives expected on the November ballot. Eight have already qualified. They include a measure to overturn the state\u2019s ban on single-use plastic bags; one to raise funds for school facilities; and another that would regulate the cost the state pays for prescription drugs. Campaigns for a dozen additional initiatives, including a proposed tobacco tax hike, are gathering signatures and could qualify their measures later this year. As money pours in for and against these initiatives, a claim by Californians for Lower Drug Prices caught our attention. The campaign is backing a measure on the November ballot that would impose price controls on state prescription drug purchases. Supporters call the initiative the California Drug Price Relief Act. And they say spending by the measure\u2019s opponent has dwarfed all other fundraising. \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the prescription drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined,\"\" Californians for Lower Drug Prices said in a March 21 press release. That campaign is funded by the Los Angeles-based nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers health services and is often at odds with the pharmaceutical industry. We wondered was its claim about Big Pharma true? Had a group of pharmaceutical companies really outspent all other ballot campaigns, combined? How much did all that spending add up to? We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It\u2019s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it\u2019s contributions came from 27 \"\"out-of-state pharmaceutical companies,\"\" as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer\u2019s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state\u2019s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America\u2019s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from\u00a01998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio \/ file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It\u2019s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it\u2019s not necessarily more that what\u2019s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It\u2019s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year\u2019s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what\u2019s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what\u2019s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle. What\u2019s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November\u2019s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. \"\"The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate,\"\" he said. \"\"When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings \u2026 you realize far more money has been raised.\"\" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year\u2019s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and \"\"missed\"\" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending \"\"is an early snapshot,\"\" noting it\u2019s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim \"\"ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October.\"\" Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot. In late March, it claimed: \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined.\"\" From our research, it\u2019s clear that 27 of the 30 companies backing Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure are, indeed, from outside California.

But the omission of the hospital association money leaves out important details that would give a different impression.

One expert estimates campaigns could dole out nearly a half billion dollars to influence the fate of the dozen or more initiatives expected on the November ballot. Eight have already qualified. They include a measure to overturn the state\u2019s ban on single-use plastic bags; one to raise funds for school facilities; and another that would regulate the cost the state pays for prescription drugs. Campaigns for a dozen additional initiatives, including a proposed tobacco tax hike, are gathering signatures and could qualify their measures later this year. As money pours in for and against these initiatives, a claim by Californians for Lower Drug Prices caught our attention. The campaign is backing a measure on the November ballot that would impose price controls on state prescription drug purchases. Supporters call the initiative the California Drug Price Relief Act. And they say spending by the measure\u2019s opponent has dwarfed all other fundraising. \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the prescription drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined,\"\" Californians for Lower Drug Prices said in a March 21 press release. That campaign is funded by the Los Angeles-based nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers health services and is often at odds with the pharmaceutical industry. We wondered was its claim about Big Pharma true? Had a group of pharmaceutical companies really outspent all other ballot campaigns, combined? How much did all that spending add up to? We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It\u2019s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it\u2019s contributions came from 27 \"\"out-of-state pharmaceutical companies,\"\" as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer\u2019s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state\u2019s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America\u2019s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from\u00a01998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio \/ file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It\u2019s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it\u2019s not necessarily more that what\u2019s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It\u2019s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year\u2019s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what\u2019s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what\u2019s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle. What\u2019s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November\u2019s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. \"\"The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate,\"\" he said. \"\"When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings \u2026 you realize far more money has been raised.\"\" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year\u2019s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and \"\"missed\"\" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending \"\"is an early snapshot,\"\" noting it\u2019s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim \"\"ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October.\"\" Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot. In late March, it claimed: \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined.\"\" From our research, it\u2019s clear that 27 of the 30 companies backing Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure are, indeed, from outside California. Together they\u2019ve amassed nearly $53 million, which dwarfs the $33 million spent on all other initiative campaigns during the 2015-2016 election cycle. But what\u2019s also clear is that Californians for Lower Drug Prices did not count a large pot of money, nearly $59\u00a0million, collected by a hospital association for a separate ballot measure. It says it simply \"\"missed\"\" these funds because it was focused on the current election cycle. Much of the $59 million\u00a0was contributed outside the timeframe used to make the claim, but it is money that was gathered to be spent on a November ballot measure. This doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that pharma firms have aggressively spent funds, so much that their totals already are in the top 20 for cash contributed for any California ballot measure. But the omission of the hospital association money leaves out important details that would give a different impression.

Philip Johnson, the individual referenced, is a noted architect\u00a0who worked on Trump\u2019s casino around the period the article was published:In the screenshot above, the second appearance of the quotation appears in the second complete paragraph on the left.

He is going to Berlin this evening to design a building at Checkpoint Charlie. Trump is talking about women and says \u201cYou have to treat \u2019em like s\u2014.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d make a good mafioso,\u201d says Johnson.\u201cOne of the greatest,\u201d says Donald as the car glides through the protected pinelands into the corrupted city.Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson.

When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and community service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice to him for the first time in his 46 years.Based on the format of the article, which jumped around and featured quotes without preceding context, Donald Trump may have been more broadly voicing his negative opinion of a woman who accused boxer Mike Tyson of rape in the early 1990s. Tyson was convicted and jailed in February 1992; the boxer was imprisoned when the Trump profile ran in November of that year.From the context, it was difficult to discern whether Trump\u2019s \u201cyou\u00a0have to treat \u2019em like shit\u201d comment was spoken outside the context of Tyson, as part of his distaste for the decision to convict his friend, or in some other context not provided.However, the citation on page 41 provided the quote in paraphrase form, in a broader characterization of Trump\u2019s commentary\u00a0about powerful men and the bad behavior women \u201callowed\u201d them to indulge in. Additionally confusing was that a nearly exact version of the phrase was presented as a direct quote attributed to Trump two pages later. In that portion, the writer claims Trump was \u201ctalking about women\u201d and said \u201cyou have to treat \u2019em like [shit. ]\u201dTrump denied making the remarks in any context in a 2016\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0interview:[Interviewer]: Let\u2019s talk about women. Your feelings toward them seem conflicted, even chauvinistic, confusing since you adore and respect your mother so much. [Trump]: I have great relationships with women, my mother, Ivana, Marla, my female executives are better than the men: tougher, smarter. [Interviewer]: So why in 1992 did you tell a writer for New York magazine, Marie Brenner, that \u2018You have to treat women like shit\u201d \u2014 ultimately pouring a bottle of wine down her back? [Trump]: I didn\u2019t say that. The woman\u2019s a liar, extremely unattractive, lots of problems because of her looks. [Interviewer]: That statement is exactly why women think you\u2019re a chauvinist pig. [Trump]: They\u2019re right \u2014 and not. People say, \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d but there\u2019s a truth in it, in a modified form. Psychologists will tell you that some women want to be treated with respect, others differently. I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, \u201cBe rougher and you\u2019ll see a different relationship.\u2019 Unfortunately, with people in general, you get more with vinegar than honey.That interview mentions Marie Brenner, a\u00a0Vanity Fair writer who profiled Trump in 1991; Brenner accused Trump of pouring wine on her because he was displeased about something she\u2019d written. The interview appeared to conflate Brenner, upon whom Trump had purportedly poured wine, and Baumgold, author of the 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.Confusion may have also stemmed from what appeared to be the first post-candidacy appearance of the claim via The Daily Beast in 2015, which mentioned both the wine claim as well as the quote from a conversation with Johnson. In March 2016, the quote in it\u2019s \u201cwomen, you have to \u2026\u201d form appeared in an attack ad.According to Baumgold, Trump was talking about women when he made the remarks, but their complete context did not appear in the piece. \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d presented a modified version of the quote, attributing the phrase to Trump as such: \u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d Although Baumgold broadly reported Trump was speaking about women when he said \u201cyou have to treat them like [shit],\u201d the complete context of the quote was missing.","sources":"https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-this-the-newest-and-clearest-photo-of-pluto\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Did+Donald+Trump+Say+%27Women%2C+You+Have+to+Treat+Them+Like+S---%27+in+a+1992+Interview%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA41&vq=%22babes%20are%20bad%22&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q=%22you%20have%20to%20treat%20them%20like%20s%22&f=false, https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/vb8pq3\/women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit-new-ad-highlights-trumps-statements-on-women, https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/you-have-to-treat-em-like-shit-before-megyn-kelly-trump-dumped-wine-on-a-female-reporter, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/donald-trump-women-unearthed-1994-primetime-interview-nancy-collins-938176, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OccupyDemocrats\/posts\/3042002795892754, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/archive.fo\/BeEY2, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/boxing-legend-convicted-of-raping-beauty-queen, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-upper-case-and-lower-case-originally-refer-to-where-printers-kept-their-letters\/, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&q=%22babes+are+bad%22#v=onepage&q=mafioso&f=false, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/tag\/occupy-democrats\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-an-arkansas-republican-propose-cutting-free-lunches-to-punish-students\/, https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/frontline\/interview\/marie-brenner\/, https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/dept-of-design\/philip-johnson-the-man-who-made-architecture-amoral, https:\/\/hoax-alert.leadstories.com\/3470895-fake-news-donald-trump-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit.html","label":3,"subjects":"Disinformation, Fact Checks","__index_level_0__":4178,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn September 14 2019 the popular \u2014 but not always accurate \u2014 Facebook page \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d shared a Donald Trump quote meme\u00a0(archived here), alleging that the President said \u201cwomen, you have to treat them like shit\u201d in a 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.To the right of an image of President Trump, text stated:\u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, 1992,\u00a0New York MagazineThis is an ACTUAL Trump quote, AND THE PART OF \u201cFAMILY VALUES\u201d COULDN\u2019T CARE LESS!The meme\u2019s claim was presented in the second part of the text, that \u201cyou have to treat [women] like shit\u201d was an \u201cactual Trump quote.\u201d The group helpfully provided a specific citation window, namely a 1992 article in\u00a0New York Magazine.As our friends at Lead Stories pointed out,\u00a0New York Magazine\u2018s archives from 1992 were searchable on Google Books.

{"claim_id":28525,"hypothesis":"A meme contains accurate information about the founders of Papa John's (John Schnatter) and Little Caesar's (Mike Ilitch) respectively.","date_published":"November 2, 2017","explanation_1":"Aside from its literal veracity (or lack thereof), this meme also cherry-picks its \u201cfacts\u201d to reflect poorly on Schnatter (whose political positions are well-known) and elides charitable contributions Papa John\u2019s has made to causes such as the Red Cross, children affected by domestic violence, and general philanthropic donations that Schnatter estimated to total around $30 million.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 2 November 2017, the Facebook page \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d shared a meme comparing purported facts about the founder of the Papa John\u2019s (John Schnatter) and Little Caesar\u2019s (the late Mike Ilitch) pizza chains:  Purported facts about Schnatter were accompanied by a red \u201cX\u201d (indicating dispproval) and those about Ilitch with a green check mark (indicating approval). The meme comprised seven claims in total, four about Schnatter and three about Ilitch, which we\u2019ll cover one by one: [Papa John\u2019s] John Schnatter, Founder [Little Caesar\u2019s] Mike Illitch [sic], Founder According to Federal Election Committee (FEC) filings, Schnatter made a total of $85,500 in political contributions in 2016, just over two percent of which went to the Trump campaign. Schnatter donated $1,000 each to two Trump campaign political action committees (PACs), he donated $33,400 to the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Kentucky Republican Leadership Fund in 2016, and $6,200 to Rand Paul\u2019s PACs. As such, the claim was true but somewhat misleading: Schnatter (a resident of Louisville) did donate to the Trump campaign, but the bulk of his financial support went elsewhere, most of it to political activity on the state level. In early November 2012, it was widely reported that Schnatter planned to cut worker hours in response to provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or \u201cObamacare\u201d): The CEO of popular pizza chain Papa John\u2019s says his employees may face reduced hours and he expects his business costs to rise because President Obama\u2019s re-election most likely insures the president\u2019s health care reform law will be implemented in full. NaplesNews.com reports John Schnatter made the remarks to a small group at Edison State College\u2019s Collier County campus the day after the election. Schnatter, who supported Mitt Romney in the election, said all Americans having health insurance under ObamaCare is a good, but estimates the change will cost Papa John\u2019s $5 million to $8 million annually. However, Schnatter asserted that his comments had been misinterpreted in an op-ed piece, explaining that his earlier remarks were speculative and pertained to franchisees of Papa John\u2019s (not the corporation itself): Many in the media reported that I said Papa John\u2019s is going to close stores and cut jobs because of Obamacare. I never said that. The fact is we are going to open over hundreds of stores this year and next and increase employment by over 5,000 jobs worldwide. And, we have no plans to cut team hours as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Clearly there was some misunderstanding somewhere. The remarks that generated the headlines were made during an entrepreneur class I was asked to speak to at a Florida college. I was asked to share my experience as an entrepreneur and to provide the students with real-life small business situations. Unbeknownst to me, until she identified herself, a reporter was there. Here is the part of the interchange that was the genesis of the news: Reporter: \u201cDo you think your \u2014 you know \u2014 franchise owners\u2026 are going to cut people hours back to make them part time instead of full time?\u201d Me: \u201cWell, in Hawaii there is a form of the same kind of health insurance and that\u2019s what you do, you find loopholes to get around it. That\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d Reporter: \u201cMy understanding is that if you\u2019re a full time employee, which is 35 hours or over, you\u2019d be covered. Or if you\u2019re part time then you wouldn\u2019t be. So wouldn\u2019t some business owners just cut people down like 34 hours a week so they wouldn\u2019t have to pay for health insurance?\u201d The reporter asked what I believed Papa John\u2019s franchisees would do in response to Obamacare, not what Papa John\u2019s would do \u2026 Papa John\u2019s, like most businesses, is still researching what the Affordable Care Act means to our operations. Regardless of the conclusion of our analysis, we will honor this law, as we do all laws, and continue to offer 100% of Papa John\u2019s corporate employees and workers in company-owned stores health insurance as we have since the company was founded in 1984. In 2015, a Papa John\u2019s franchisee (not the chain, nor Schnatter) was found guilty of wage theft and noncompliance with New York State laws pertaining to overtime: Abdul Jamil Khokhar, who owns nine Papa John\u2019s locations in New York City with BMY Foods, pled guilty to failing to pay workers in compliance with the New York Labor Law, which is a misdemeanor, and to filing false business records, a felony. He will serve 60 days in jail for failing to pay his workers the minimum wage and overtime and has agreed to pay $230,000 in restitution to the workers \u2026 Instead of paying his employees the proper minimum overtime wages according to New York State law, Khokhar paid them the same minimum wage they would make during regular hours. To hide this illegal practice, he created fake names for employees in the computer system and used the fake names to avoid paying the time-and-a-half rate required for overtime. So an employee who worked for more than 40 hours would be paid for regular work hours under his or her own name, and any overtime hours would be paid as straight hours to a fictitious employee. Khokar was an independent franchise owner, and his 2015 conviction was falsely attributed to Schnatter in the meme. Separate instances also involved the actions of independent franchisees, not Papa John\u2019s itself. In August 2012, news outlets reported that Schnatter was planning to pass increased health insurance costs onto customers in order to protect \u201cshareholders\u2019 best interests\u201d: And if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act rolls out as planned in 2014, Schnatter\u2019s strategy is \u201cof course \u2026 to pass that cost on the consumer in order to protect our shareholders\u2019 best interest,\u201d he said in a recent conference call. Schnatter estimates that the legislation will cost Papa John\u2019s about 11 cents to 14 cents per pizza, which equates to 15 cents to 20 cents per order. An average delivery charge runs $1.75 to $2.50. Schnatter\u2019s claims about an 11- to 14-cent per pizza increase in prices occurred in tandem with his earlier referenced ACA-related remarks. As with those previous comments, Schnatter later maintained his remarks had been misinterpreted: Most visibly, Papa John\u2019s CEO John Schnatter repeatedly claimed that Obamacare would increase the price of a pizza by eleven to fourteen cents (even if you accept his numbers, hardly a dramatic setback). CNN did some fact checking, and found that the exact costs of Obamacare for the chain were incalculable thanks to the pizza franchise\u2019s refusal to provide pertinent data (such as the number of pizzas they sell, how many full-time employees they have, what their current health care plan is, etc.). However, they rated Schnatter\u2019s claims as \u201cfalse\u201d because Obamacare does not require companies to provide health care plans to part-time employees, as well as exempts many small businesses (such as the local franchises which compose Papa John\u2019s retail locations) from the health care requirements. After being debunked, Papa John\u2019s is backing off from its claims that Obamacare would raise prices and potentially cost jobs, now saying Schnatter was quoted incorrectly. Due to the business\u2019 strength, the company now says, Papa John\u2019s could absorb the added costs easily. Schnatter stated that his earlier remarks were misconstrued, and denied pizza prices would go up by the minor amount mentioned. Although it was true Schnatter speculated higher Obamacare-related costs would be \u201cpass[ed] on\u201d to customers, he soon revised his position and no surcharge was added. The meme then turned to Ilitch, who died in February 2017. Back in February 2014, SportsBusiness Daily reported that Ilitch had arranged to pay for housing for civil rights icon Rosa Parks after she was robbed and assaulted in her Detroit home: On Aug. 31, 1994, Parks, then 81, was robbed and assaulted in her home in central Detroit. [Judge Damon] Keith called real estate developer Alfred Taubman, the owner of Riverfront Apartments, about finding a safer home for Parks. Taubman pledged to find the best home available. When Ilitch read about Keith\u2019s plan and Taubman\u2019s promise in the newspaper, he called the judge and said he would pay for Parks\u2019 housing for as long as necessary. (Parks passed away in 2005 at the age of 92). Keith served as the executor of the trust established for Parks\u2019 housing. The episode is just one of many throughout Ilitch\u2019s life when he stepped forward to help (see box), usually outside of the spotlight. Keith produced a canceled November 1994 check and affirmed that Ilitch had paid Parks\u2019 rent from 1994 until her death in 2005, adding that it was \u201cimportant\u201d people learn of that circumstance. This claim appears to reference Little Caesar\u2019s Love Kitchen, described on the company\u2019s web site as follows: THE LITTLE CAESARS LOVE KITCHEN travels across the United States to help those in need. We have two trucks in operation so we can be of service 365 days a year. These restaurants on wheels have served more than three million people. The Love Kitchen has been recognized for its charitable efforts as well, receiving The President\u2019s Volunteer Action Award Citation from former Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. The Reagan administration also awarded the Love Kitchen a Presidential Citation for Private Sector Initiatives. Additionally, the Love Kitchen has received a certificate of appreciation from the State of Michigan and was recognized by the Detroit City Council for its efforts in the Gulf Coast region. The Love Kitchen\u2019s 30th anniversary was recognized when it was listed in the Congressional Record by U.S. Congresswoman Candice Miller, on April 30, 2015. The Love Kitchen charity was founded\u00a0by Ilitch in 1985. In September 2007, news outlets reported that Ilitch had \u201creceived the U.S. Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s top civilian honor for giving war veterans franchise opportunities,\u201d with one press release stating: In recognition of his service to Veterans, Honorable R. James Nicholson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, will present Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc. founder Michael Ilitch with the Secretary\u2019s Award, the highest tribute given to a private citizen by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The ceremony, which will take place today in the nation\u2019s capitol at the Department of Veterans Affairs at 2:30 p.m. ET, recognizes Mr. Ilitch\u2019s industry-leading support of Veterans through the Little Caesars Veterans Program. \u201cMichael Ilitch has demonstrated great patriotism by providing business opportunities to honorably discharged Veterans through the Little Caesars Veterans Program,\u201d said Nicholson. \u201cThis award, the highest honor my office can bestow, represents the VA\u2019s appreciation of a Detroit business leader who is making a difference for U.S. military Veterans as they transition to civilian life or make a career change.\u201d Launched on Veterans Day (November 9) 2006, the program provides honorably discharged, service-disabled Veterans who qualify as Little Caesars franchisees a benefit of up to $68,000. Honorably discharged, non service-disabled Veterans who qualify as Little Caesars franchisees are eligible for a benefit of $10,000. Ilitch, a former Marine, has made giving back part of the way Little Caesars has done business since shortly after opening the first store in 1959. \u201cVeterans and their families have made significant sacrifices for our country, and I feel that it\u2019s important to acknowledge that, and to thank them for their service,\u201d said Michael Ilitch, founder and chairman, Little Caesars. \u201cAs I thought about the businesses I own, I thought what better way to say thank you to the men and women who have given so much for our nation than to provide them with a business opportunity: becoming a Little Caesars franchisee. I\u2019m very honored that the program, and the people who created it, are being recognized with this prestigious award.\u201d","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Politics, john schnatter, little caesars, mike ilitch","__index_level_0__":6587,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn 2 November 2017, the Facebook page \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d shared a meme comparing purported facts about the founder of the Papa John\u2019s (John Schnatter) and Little Caesar\u2019s (the late Mike Ilitch) pizza chains:  Purported facts about Schnatter were accompanied by a red \u201cX\u201d (indicating dispproval) and those about Ilitch with a green check mark (indicating approval).

In many cases, normal wear and tear means N95 respirators cannot be sanitized and reused without putting health workers at risk.","fact_checkers":"Shefali Luthra","premise":"\"As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, front-line health care workers are decrying unsafe working conditions \u2014 in particular, describing inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or PPE. Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available. But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. \"\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"\"may be effective\"\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"\"when there are insufficient supplies.\"\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"\"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\" The reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"\"Decontamination is a complicated process,\"\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"\"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,\"\" she said. N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration. Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle\u2019s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit. \"\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\"\" Kenney said. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\"\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. In describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators, Trump said the United States is using \"\"some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask.\"\" That, he argued, \"\"is like ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" It is true that technology exists to sterilize N95s up to 20 times. But there are knowledge gaps and other shortcomings that limit how effective this process is. Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as \"\"ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that undermine the president\u2019s point.\"","sources":"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d6f6793c5352acec043\/1587699055513\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_UV-C_Fact_Sheet_V2.0_FINAL.pdf, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d8146c37a5e245b2020\/1587699073860\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_HydrogenPeroxide_Technical_Report_v2.0_final.pdf, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/136529\/download, https:\/\/khn.org\/news\/widely-used-surgical-masks-are-putting-health-care-workers-at-serious-risk\/, https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/03\/30\/823803831\/technology-to-clean-and-reuse-ppe-is-being-deployed-to-hotspot-hospitals, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d86ad96f7626cdd1472\/1587699079169\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_HydrogenPeroxide_factsheet_v2.0_final.pdf, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/11\/business\/coronavirus-n95-mask-decontaminating-reuse.html, https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef\/t\/5ea25d7d0793ed73ac17c4ca\/1587699069547\/2020-04-23_N95DECON_Heat_factsheet_v2.0_final.pdf, https:\/\/www.battelle.org\/docs\/default-source\/commercial-offerings\/industry-solutions\/729_battelle-ccds-final.pdf?sfvrsn=62cbf7c4_2, https:\/\/khn.org\/news\/osha-probing-health-worker-deaths-but-urges-inspectors-to-spare-the-penalties\/","label":3,"subjects":"Health Check, Coronavirus, Donald Trump, ","__index_level_0__":5561,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, front-line health care workers are decrying unsafe working conditions \u2014 in particular, describing inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or PPE.

So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"\"may be effective\"\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"\"when there are insufficient supplies.\"\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"\"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\" The reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"\"Decontamination is a complicated process,\"\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"\"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,\"\" she said. N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration. Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle\u2019s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit. \"\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\"\" Kenney said. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\"\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. In describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators, Trump said the United States is using \"\"some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask.\"\" That, he argued, \"\"is like ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" It is true that technology exists to sterilize N95s up to 20 times. But there are knowledge gaps and other shortcomings that limit how effective this process is. Government authorities and health care researchers are clear that this is a crisis measure and it is in no way as effective as \"\"ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details that undermine the president\u2019s point.\"n\nClaim: \u201cWe\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks.\u201d\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Partially true and false. While it is true that there is technology available to sterilize masks up to 20 times, it is false to claim that this is equivalent to ordering 20 times more masks. Experts have stated that decontamination is not as effective as purchasing new masks, and there are limitations and risks associated with reusing masks."}

Your ownership of your DNA, on the other hand, is limited in years. The article has caused widespread\u00a0concern\u00a0and prompted a public response from Ancestry.com\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer Eric Heath, who called Winston\u2019s post \u201cinflammatory and inaccurate\u201d. In response to our questions, Heath emphasized that Ancestry.com does not take ownership of your DNA; rather, you license it to them: \u2026The consumer maintains ownership of their data. This is actually why we need a license in order to conduct our analysis, display their results, and so on. Not only do they own their own data, but we allow them to download their raw data and they can ask us to destroy the data any time. Several documents control customers\u2019 agreements with Ancestry.com: the terms and conditions, an informed consent agreement, and the privacy policy. Before signing up for the DNA test, Heath says, you can also opt out of allowing your DNA data to be used for research, whether academic or commercial, when signing the informed consent agreement: Aside from the right to use their data to provide our services, we always ask for separate approval to use data in any other way.

At its most basic, a license is defined as \u201ca permit from an authority to own or use something.\u201d Ancestry.com does not have \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d because customers still retain ownership of their own DNA. Ancestry.com does not have \u201cabsolute ownership\u201d because customers can revoke the license. But, Ancestry.com irrefutably takes ownership of customers\u2019 genetic data by contractual license granted in the Terms and Conditions.

Even if a customer left every opt-out unclicked, and gave Ancestry.com full permission to do anything they were legally entitled to do with your data, Ben-Shahar says that it still be licensed, not owned, and you can still legally\u00a0retract it at any time. In his blog post, Winston also pointed out that customers can revoke their consent at any time. However, he directed us towards a section of the AncestryDNA\u00a0informed consent\u00a0agreement that addresses the potential risks of signing up for the DNA test: There is a potential risk that data about you could become public as the result of a security breach\u2026There is a potential risk that third parties could identify you from research that is made publicly available, for example if published in a scientific journal\u2026When DNA samples are physically transferred from us to collaborators, there is a potential risk that the samples could be lost or taken while in transit or storage. We take precautions to reduce the likelihood that this will happen and DNA samples are not transferred with your name or contact information. As Ancestry.com explains in the informed consent agreement, the fact that they remove identifying information from your DNA data before they add it to their database does not remove\u00a0this risk: Although we remove common identifying information (such as your name and contact information) from any data before publication, genetic data is different from other data because it can be used as an identifier in combination with other information. It is not currently common to do this but it can be done, particularly if genetic data about you or genetic relatives is available from other public genetic databases. Jeff Sovern, a law professor at St John\u2019s University in New York City\u00a0and an expert in consumer law, told us the circumstances under\u00a0which Ancestry.com might share your DNA data with others could be wider than they first appear. One significant section of the Terms and Conditions read as follows (until it was changed in light of the May 2017 controversy):\u00a0 By submitting DNA to AncestryDNA, you grant AncestryDNA and the Ancestry Group Companies a perpetual, royalty-free, world-wide, transferable license to use your DNA, and any DNA you submit for any person from whom you obtained legal authorization as described in this Agreement, and to use, host, sublicense and distribute the resulting analysis to the extent and in the form or context we deem appropriate on or through any media or medium and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered. The company no longer describes the license as \u201cperpetual\u201d, and the phrase \u201cto the extent and in the form or context we deem appropriate\u201d has been removed: By submitting DNA to AncestryDNA, you grant AncestryDNA and the Ancestry Group Companies a royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable license to host, transfer, process, analyze, distribute, and communicate your Genetic Information for the purposes of providing you products and services, conducting Ancestry\u2019s research and product development, enhancing Ancestry\u2019s user experience, and making and offering personalized products and services. In other words: we use your Genetic Information to provide products and services to you and improve our products and services for all our users. In addition, you understand that by providing any DNA to us, you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products that may be developed by AncestryDNA using your Genetic Information. Jeff Sovern said that the privacy statement\u2019s use of examples, rather than an exhaustive\u00a0list of scenarios in which user\u2019s information can be shared, makes him \u201cnervous\u201d:  That means the list is not complete, and there could be circumstances in which Ancestry could disclose the data that are not included in the list. Here\u2019s an analogy: if someone says \u201cexamples of things I do when I go out are to see a movie or a show,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean the person doesn\u2019t also go out to get drunk. Signing up for Ancestry.com\u2019s DNA test does not mean that the company owns your DNA data, in the complete and permanent way in which that word is typically understood. Customers license it to the company. Customers can choose not to allow their genetic information to be used for certain purposes, and can also revoke the license and have the DNA data and sample destroyed\u00a0if they wish \u2014 something that would not be possible if Ancestry.com owned them outright. However, granting Ancestry.com that license can involve giving them relatively significant rights over DNA data, and the scope of these rights may go beyond what is immediately apparent.

The company no longer describes the license as \u201cperpetual\u201d, and the phrase \u201cto the extent and in the form or context we deem appropriate\u201d has been removed: By submitting DNA to AncestryDNA, you grant AncestryDNA and the Ancestry Group Companies a royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable license to host, transfer, process, analyze, distribute, and communicate your Genetic Information for the purposes of providing you products and services, conducting Ancestry\u2019s research and product development, enhancing Ancestry\u2019s user experience, and making and offering personalized products and services. In other words: we use your Genetic Information to provide products and services to you and improve our products and services for all our users. In addition, you understand that by providing any DNA to us, you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products that may be developed by AncestryDNA using your Genetic Information. Jeff Sovern said that the privacy statement\u2019s use of examples, rather than an exhaustive\u00a0list of scenarios in which user\u2019s information can be shared, makes him \u201cnervous\u201d:  That means the list is not complete, and there could be circumstances in which Ancestry could disclose the data that are not included in the list. Here\u2019s an analogy: if someone says \u201cexamples of things I do when I go out are to see a movie or a show,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean the person doesn\u2019t also go out to get drunk. Signing up for Ancestry.com\u2019s DNA test does not mean that the company owns your DNA data, in the complete and permanent way in which that word is typically understood. Customers license it to the company. Customers can choose not to allow their genetic information to be used for certain purposes, and can also revoke the license and have the DNA data and sample destroyed\u00a0if they wish \u2014 something that would not be possible if Ancestry.com owned them outright. However, granting Ancestry.com that license can involve giving them relatively significant rights over DNA data, and the scope of these rights may go beyond what is immediately apparent. Furthermore, licensing your DNA data to Ancestry.com does come with risks to your privacy, as well as potentially resulting in problems obtaining life insurance or, in certain circumstances, even getting hired for a particular job.n\nClaim: Ancestry.com can retain the rights to your genetic information if you sign up for their DNA testing.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","explanation_gpt":"Partially true and false. \n\nThe evidence shows that Ancestry.com does not take ownership of your DNA, but rather customers license it to the company. Customers can also revoke the license and have their DNA data and sample destroyed if they wish. However, Ancestry.com does retain certain rights over the DNA data, as outlined in their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, while Ancestry.com does not own the genetic information outright, they do have certain rights to it."}
{"claim_id":9506,"hypothesis":"Tweaking brains with \u2018smart drugs\u2019 to get ahead in Silicon Valley","date_published":"June 14, 2017","explanation_1":"This story about purported brain-boosting pills would have been easier to swallow if it came with a stronger shot of skepticism. The story would have benefited greatly from at least one source who isn\u2019t involved in the cognitive-enhancement movement. It does a better job of describing the availability of these supplements and the hyper-competitive culture that feeds this emerging market. The term \u201cnootropics\u201d applies to a wide variety of substances that apparently require no safety or efficacy trials, no FDA approval, and no prescription from a doctor. As a result, media coverage is often consumers\u2019 only tool to counter the marketing hype when attempting to determine whether these products will do them good or harm, or simply waste their money. Sadly critical coverage is in short supply. Back in 2015, HealthNewsReview.org Associate Editor Kathlyn Stone wrote that nootropics were \u201cunder the radar\u201d of journalists, despite heavy marketing targeted at students and young professionals. That appears to be changing, but journalists need to be cognizant of their role as consumer watchdogs.","fact_checkers":"Mary Chris Jaklevic,Steven J.

For more on that, read the section on availability.) The story doesn\u2019t quantify any known benefits of these brain enhancers, for example if memory increased by a certain percent. Harms are addressed\u2013enough to be Satisfactory for this criteria. But the discussion is confusing. The story initially says nootropics have \u201csupposedly few side effects and low toxicity.\u201d Later it states: As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling.

Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said. This story falls into the trap of relying on positive anecdotes as evidence, citing an entrepreneur who \u201ccredits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees,\u201d as well as a physician who said he with experimented with piracetam and found it \u201chelpful.\u201d Also troublesome is this statement: \u201cPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities.\u201d\u00a0 Saying it\u2019s \u201cwell studied\u201d in the same sentence as giving purported benefits is confusing and may lead readers to assume incorrectly that these benefits were proven in studies. Lastly, the story quotes advocates of fasting without cautioning that what works in mice may not apply to humans. Comments Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging: \u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases.\u201d In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cconclusive evidence from animal studies.\u201d To its credit, the story does eventually\u2013but very briefly\u2013explore the quality of the evidence, mainly via\u00a0this comment from Duke University Health System researcher Murali Doraiswamy: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence.\u201d There\u2019s no outright disease-mongering here, but the preposterous quote that it is \u201cthe few who are getting ahead who are using supplements\u201d should have been challenged.

The story lacks comment from an independent expert who\u2019s not involved with selling, prescribing or taking nootropics or some other cognition-boosting product. The story doesn\u2019t address proven strategies to improve mental skills such as good nutrition, adequate sleep, social engagement, cognitively challenging activities, and exercise. The story does a good job here, although it injects confusion when it states that in the U.S. piracetam \u201ccan be sold only for research purposes,\u201d but later says that piracetam and similar drugs are available online. In fact, the FDA at least twice warned suppliers, in 2010 and 2012, that piracetam was classified as a drug and could not be sold as a supplement. According to online accounts, that FDA action prompted major retailers to stop carrying it, which could explain why it\u2019s not present in some products marketed as nootropics. The story also states: \u201cA number of companies now market nootropic \u2018stacks,\u2019 or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\u201d There story gives perspective, mentioning that piracetam has been around for decades, though newer formulations are on the market, and that companies have recently begun marketing \u201cstacks\u201d with multiple supplements.
