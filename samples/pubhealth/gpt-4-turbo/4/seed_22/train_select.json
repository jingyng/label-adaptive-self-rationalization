{"claim_id":36157,"hypothesis":"An image shows a man's mostly-consumed Red Bull energy drink, after he found a dead mouse in the container.","date_published":"September 24, 2019","explanation_1":"Did a Man Find a Dead Mouse in a Nearly Empty Red Bull Can?","fact_checkers":"  Kim LaCapria  ","premise":"On September 5 2019, Facebook user Seth Bowman shared the following post (archived here), alongside a claim his Red Bull energy drink was contaminated by a dead mouse. According to Bowman\u2019s claim, he had nearly finished drinking the can of Red Bull when \u201cchunks\u201d alerted him to the presence of the former rodent:So I drank a whole Red Bull the other night at work and found this at the bottom. I\u2019ve tried contacting Red Bull and haven\u2019t heard a word back. So do me a favor and let\u2019s make this viral.Bowman requested that predictably disgusted Facebook users do him \u201ca favor\u201d and \u201cmake this viral\u201d; they did,\u00a0 sharing the post over 150,000 times. We did not see users sharing the post to Red Bull\u2019s social media accounts, nor did we find any public acknowledgement of Bowman\u2019s claim. A friend of the poster shared the claim to Reddit\u2019s r\/WTF, where readers were skeptical.Bowman was certainly not the first person to claim they found a dead rodent in a soft drink or energy drink. In a 1988 newspaper column, folklorist\u00a0Jan Harold Brunvand examined claims that at the time spread without Facebook or email, indicating they appeared to be as old as bottled soft drinks themselves, and instances of ostension \u2014 when people took the claim to real life.Brunvand explained how the stories existed on two levels \u2014 one being the claims as they appeared as early as 1914, and another being representative of our fears involving handing off the responsibility for food safety from our homes to faceless corporations:A search of published appeals-court records conducted in 1976 turned up 45 such cases against soda bottlers, the first in 1914. And one can only guess how many similar cases were never appealed or were settled out of court.Most of the people who tell the mouse-in-Coke legend don\u2019t know the legal history, though. What they do know is a good story, whether it\u2019s told by a friend, a neighbor or co-worker. The tellers assume that somewhere, sometime, an actual lawsuit was brought against a soft-drink bottling company.So while the lawsuits are real, the stories are not, because they are so far separated from the original facts that they\u2019ve turned into folklore. In this way, a story can be both an actual event and a legend. And the mouse-in-Coke legends, like most urban legends, have lives of their own completely separate from the facts.What has occurred, I believe, is something like this: The theme of foreign matter contaminating food is a popular one in urban legends. And \u201cCoke\u201d has become virtually a generic way to refer to soft drinks. So the legends get started and gain credibility from lawsuits that people vaguely remember, in which mice were said to be found in soda bottles. And naturally, it is usually Coke that is mentioned in the legend whether or not the original suits were against Coke.As the legend spreads by word of mouth, the trauma is exaggerated, the drama heightened. And the size of the settlement, of course, grows and grows. The end result: The indignation against the giant corporation that is selling contaminated food is pumped up to a full measure of outrage.In 2016, The Verge published a \u201cbrief history\u201d of viral claims about dead mice or rats in sodas and energy drinks. Following yet another claim involving a deceased rodent and Dr. Pepper, the news organization examined several such claims, many of which appeared in 2012.The article referenced a notable 2012 lawsuit against PepsiCo, brought by a man who alleged he found a dead mouse in a can of Mountain Dew:Ronald Ball, 52, from Madison County, Ill., claims he tasted something foul in the can of drink he purchased from a vending machine at his work.According to his lawsuit, Ball claims he spat out the soda, the Madison County Record reported. He said he \u201ctook a drink, and immediately became violently ill such that he began to vomit \u2026\u00a0The contents of said can of Mountain Dew were immediately poured into a Styrofoam cup wherein a dead mouse was found,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.Ball sent the mouse to PepsiCo \u2014 along with a letter of complaint \u2014 but the oil company worker says the soda giant destroyed the body of the mouse, and therefore, his evidence.The incident happened in November 2009 and Ball [was] seeking $50,000 damages.Ball\u2019s suit led to a rather nauseating spate of articles about whether the composition of Mountain Dew would degrade or preserve the corpse of a small animal, with lawyers arguing that the beverage would rapidly dissolve a mouse\u2019s remains:Key to Pepsi\u2019s legal argument is that there\u2019s no chance a mouse\u2019s corpse could survive, intact, for 15 months swimming in Mountain Dew. While published studies have not been conducted on how rapidly Mountain Dew would dissolve a mouse, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the neon green soda can eat away teeth and bones in a matter of months, and would likely do quite a number on a rodent.\u201cI think it is plausible that it could dissolve a mouse in a few months,\u201d said Yan-Fang Ren of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who has studied the effects of citric acid on bones and teeth. \u201cBut dissolving [the mouse] does not mean it will disappear, because you\u2019ll still have the collagen and the soft tissue part. It will be like rubber.\u201dA similar claim was reported in 2011, involving the Monster brand of energy drinks. Another brand of energy drink was at the center of similar claims in 2016, when a consumer was purportedly sickened by a dead mouse in a beverage can:[Jordan] Bell started dry heaving and went straight to a doctor, who advised he go to the hospital. At the Mission Hospital they contacted BC Poison Control and told Bell that in about 24 hours he would probably experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.And in March 2018, an Arkansas Red Bull drinker reported finding a rodent at the bottom of his can. His claim went viral on Facebook, but many users were skeptical of its legitimacy:While [claimant Josh] Henley said it was not possible the rodent got inside the can when he left it in the car overnight, many people on social media said it was the highest possibility.The video, which was shared [in March 2018], went viral and was viewed more than 100,000 times and counting. It was first shared by Henley on Facebook.Some social media users also raised doubts about the legitimacy of the video.Joshua Nightingale commented: \u201cYou drank it last night, most likely that mouse got in after you drank it and went to sleep. Wouldn\u2019t you have noticed it last night after or while you were drinking it?\u201d Another comment said: \u201cIt obviously went in after you drank it.\u201dIn a statement to Mirror Online, a spokesman for Red Bull said: \u201cIt is inconceivable that a particle \u2014 let alone anything like this \u2014 could pass through the process of world-class, modern beverage manufacture.\u201dIn April 2017, beverage corporation lawyers once again argued the claims were impossible, and that the specimen was not sufficiently decomposed:[The claimant was] suing Coca-Cola for a modest amount, having medical bills related to his illness that total around $1,000, and he missed 60 hours of work. He also says that he lost thirty pounds due to his illness.Coca-Cola, however, disputes that it\u2019s possible to find such an intact mouse in one of its beverage cans. In the time that it would take for a mouse to be sealed inside a can at a bottling plant, then for the can to be distributed to a retail store and purchased, the mouse would have decomposed enough to have \u201ccompromised the can,\u201d or given off gases that would make the can bulge or burst.An attorney from Minnesota who is on the team representing Coke explained to the Mitchell Republic that the company \u201ctakes these cases extremely seriously and tries them all,\u201d since allegations of mouse contamination are damaging to its brand. Settling for a modest amount would be cheaper and easier, but the company would rather defend itself at trial \u2026 The plaintiff is seeking $2,026 and general damages, plus interest.That coverage raised two interesting aspects about dead-mouse-in-soda-can claims: that beverage companies maintain that they always take such suits to trial, and tacitly that claims of this sort seem to be somewhat common. It also appears that beverage manufacturers often feel confident rodent-in-soda claims are unlikely to hold up in court. The outlet quoted above also linked to a similar legal claim, with findings that the creature was a \u201ctoad\u201d and that no mechanism for its presence was ever determined.In 2012, however, Ball\u2019s claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and it was conditional in part on PepsiCo disclaiming responsibility. The 2009 case involving what appeared to be a toad yielded little useful information with respect to such contamination and how it might occur. At the time, a PepsiCo spokesman declined via email to speculate on how the toad got there:The FDA also conducted an investigation at the local Pepsi bottling plant in Orlando from August 4 to 11 [2009] and \u201cdid not find any adverse conditions or association to this problem,\u201d spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said.\u201cWe have not determined when or how the contamination occurred,\u201d DeLancey said in an e-mail.Pepsi says the FDA results \u201caffirmed\u201d the company\u2019s confidence \u201cin the quality of our products and the integrity of our manufacturing system,\u201d according to spokesman Jeff Dahncke.\u201cThe speed of our production lines and the rigor of our quality control systems make it virtually impossible for this type of thing to happen in a production environment. In fact, there never has been even a single instance when a claim of this nature has been traced back to a manufacturing issue \u2026\u00a0The FDA conducted a thorough inspection of our Orlando facility and found no cause for concern. In this case, the FDA simply was unable to determine when or how the specimen entered the package.\u201dWhen asked if Pepsi believed it was not responsible for the animal getting into the can, Dahncke said, \u201cWe have addressed the facts of the investigation and stated our position. It\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment beyond that.\u201dA September 2019 Facebook post claiming a user found a dead mouse in his can of Red Bull was virally popular, but neither unique in structure nor even as it pertained to Red Bull. Stories about dead rodents in bottled or canned soft drinks date back more than a century, and occasionally cross from the realm of folklore into the news by way of claims like the one to hand.

According to Bowman\u2019s claim, he had nearly finished drinking the can of Red Bull when \u201cchunks\u201d alerted him to the presence of the former rodent:So I drank a whole Red Bull the other night at work and found this at the bottom. I\u2019ve tried contacting Red Bull and haven\u2019t heard a word back. So do me a favor and let\u2019s make this viral.Bowman requested that predictably disgusted Facebook users do him \u201ca favor\u201d and \u201cmake this viral\u201d; they did,\u00a0 sharing the post over 150,000 times. We did not see users sharing the post to Red Bull\u2019s social media accounts, nor did we find any public acknowledgement of Bowman\u2019s claim. A friend of the poster shared the claim to Reddit\u2019s r\/WTF, where readers were skeptical.Bowman was certainly not the first person to claim they found a dead rodent in a soft drink or energy drink. In a 1988 newspaper column, folklorist\u00a0Jan Harold Brunvand examined claims that at the time spread without Facebook or email, indicating they appeared to be as old as bottled soft drinks themselves, and instances of ostension \u2014 when people took the claim to real life.Brunvand explained how the stories existed on two levels \u2014 one being the claims as they appeared as early as 1914, and another being representative of our fears involving handing off the responsibility for food safety from our homes to faceless corporations:A search of published appeals-court records conducted in 1976 turned up 45 such cases against soda bottlers, the first in 1914. And one can only guess how many similar cases were never appealed or were settled out of court.Most of the people who tell the mouse-in-Coke legend don\u2019t know the legal history, though. What they do know is a good story, whether it\u2019s told by a friend, a neighbor or co-worker. The tellers assume that somewhere, sometime, an actual lawsuit was brought against a soft-drink bottling company.So while the lawsuits are real, the stories are not, because they are so far separated from the original facts that they\u2019ve turned into folklore. In this way, a story can be both an actual event and a legend. And the mouse-in-Coke legends, like most urban legends, have lives of their own completely separate from the facts.What has occurred, I believe, is something like this: The theme of foreign matter contaminating food is a popular one in urban legends. And \u201cCoke\u201d has become virtually a generic way to refer to soft drinks. So the legends get started and gain credibility from lawsuits that people vaguely remember, in which mice were said to be found in soda bottles. And naturally, it is usually Coke that is mentioned in the legend whether or not the original suits were against Coke.As the legend spreads by word of mouth, the trauma is exaggerated, the drama heightened. And the size of the settlement, of course, grows and grows. The end result: The indignation against the giant corporation that is selling contaminated food is pumped up to a full measure of outrage.In 2016, The Verge published a \u201cbrief history\u201d of viral claims about dead mice or rats in sodas and energy drinks.

{"claim_id":38858,"hypothesis":" An over-the-counter supplement called Synagen IQ boosts brain function, improves memory and promotes overall wellness. ","date_published":"September 2, 2015","explanation_1":"Synagen IQ Boosts Brain Function and Overall Health ","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"Claims about the medical benefits of Synagen IQ are unproven. Synagen IQ is classified as a supplement, so the FDA doesn\u2019t regulate it. That means the manufacturer of Synagen IQ doesn\u2019t have to back up its claims that the supplement increases brain power, focus, memory and energy with clinical trials or studies. There\u2019s no way to independently confirm or debunk those claims, either. Synagen IQ is marketed as an \u201call natural\u201d supplement, but the manufacturer won\u2019t reveal what its active ingredients are. Given all that, it\u2019s impossible to prove whether or not Synagen IQ actually boosts brain function. But so-called miracle drugs that are supposed to reverse memory loss and boost brain function are nothing new. Back in 2010, another over-the-counter supplement called Procera AVH hit the market with an identical claim to \u201cboost brain power.\u201d The medical director of the Byrd Alzheimer\u2019s Institute at the University of South Florida said Procera AVH and similar products \u201cgive people false hope.\u201d The Tampa Bay Times reports: Many doctors say the supplements lack scientific evidence to prove they work, and as nutritional supplements,\u00a0they are not regulated by the federal government as are medications. The ads tout clinical trials, but these are at\u00a0best small, short-term tests published in journals that are not well-known or respected \u2014 hardly comparable with\u00a0accepted medical standards. Some brain supplements do contain ingredients that have been studied extensively and are used widely for\u00a0memory disorders. The moss extract huperzine A, found in Procera AVH, has similar properties to the Alzheimer\u2019s\u00a0drug Aricept, and is the most common treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s in China, Smith said. But with vague labeling and little regulation, there\u2019s no way to know how much of these ingredients are in any\u00a0supplement, or how high their quality is.

Synagen IQ is classified as a supplement, so the FDA doesn\u2019t regulate it. That means the manufacturer of Synagen IQ doesn\u2019t have to back up its claims that the supplement increases brain power, focus, memory and energy with clinical trials or studies. There\u2019s no way to independently confirm or debunk those claims, either. Synagen IQ is marketed as an \u201call natural\u201d supplement, but the manufacturer won\u2019t reveal what its active ingredients are. Given all that, it\u2019s impossible to prove whether or not Synagen IQ actually boosts brain function. But so-called miracle drugs that are supposed to reverse memory loss and boost brain function are nothing new. Back in 2010, another over-the-counter supplement called Procera AVH hit the market with an identical claim to \u201cboost brain power.\u201d The medical director of the Byrd Alzheimer\u2019s Institute at the University of South Florida said Procera AVH and similar products \u201cgive people false hope.\u201d The Tampa Bay Times reports: Many doctors say the supplements lack scientific evidence to prove they work, and as nutritional supplements,\u00a0they are not regulated by the federal government as are medications. The ads tout clinical trials, but these are at\u00a0best small, short-term tests published in journals that are not well-known or respected \u2014 hardly comparable with\u00a0accepted medical standards. Some brain supplements do contain ingredients that have been studied extensively and are used widely for\u00a0memory disorders. The moss extract huperzine A, found in Procera AVH, has similar properties to the Alzheimer\u2019s\u00a0drug Aricept, and is the most common treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s in China, Smith said. But with vague labeling and little regulation, there\u2019s no way to know how much of these ingredients are in any\u00a0supplement, or how high their quality is. So, there\u2019s no scientific or medical research to back up claims that supplements like Synagen IQ actually work. It\u2019s best to talk to your doctor before taking any of these over-the-counter pills, and to not believe claims that aren\u2019t backed up with research. Commentsn\nClaim:  An over-the-counter supplement called Synagen IQ boosts brain function, improves memory and promotes overall wellness. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that Synagen IQ boosts brain function, improves memory, and promotes overall wellness cannot be confirmed or debunked based on available evidence. The product lacks clinical trials or scientific studies to substantiate its claims, as it is not regulated by the FDA. Furthermore, the manufacturer does not disclose the active ingredients, making it impossible to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the supplement. Therefore, there is not enough information to determine if the claim is true or false."}

Additionally, NBC News reported that a similar rumor was propagated by a fake Twitter account linked to the white supremacist group Identity Evropa, which was designed to incite fear and violence under the guise of 'antifa' activities. This misinformation was intended to fuel tensions rather than report factual events. No verifiable evidence supports the claim, and it aligns with patterns of disinformation historically debunked in similar contexts."}
{"claim_id":37782,"hypothesis":"Someone put a tampon into a Los Angeles police officer's Starbucks drink.","date_published":"June 23, 2020","explanation_1":"Did a Los Angeles Police Officer Find a Tampon in His Starbucks Cup?","fact_checkers":"  Arturo Garcia  ","premise":"Police in Los Angeles accused workers at a nearby Target store of tampering with an off-duty officer\u2019s drink in June 2020, reigniting debate following other questionable claims by law enforcement agencies \u2014 but the object in the drink wasn\u2019t what was initially claimed.According to KTTV-TV, the officer allegedly found what he described as \u201ca tampon\u201d inside the Frappuccino he ordered at a Starbucks located within the Target in Diamond Bar, a small city in Los Angeles County. Reporter Bill Melugin posted a photograph of the alleged tampon on Twitter:The officer was reportedly not wearing his uniform and paid for the drink with a debit card issued by a police credit union.We contacted Target seeking comment; the company sent us the same statement it gave to KTTV:We take this allegation seriously. We have reviewed video footage and have not found any suspicious behavior. We have shared the video with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and look forward to the conclusions of their investigation.Reached for comment and asked how the officer determined that the alleged object was a tampon, the sheriff\u2019s department also shared a statement:Walnut Station Detectives are investigating an incident of alleged poisoning of food or drink at a local business. The incident was reported to have occurred Friday, June 19, 2020 at approximately 2:30p.m., on the 700 block of Grand Avenue in the city of Diamond Bar. The victim as a male White 36 years-old. This is an ongoing investigation. No further information is available at this time.The claim was formally debunked in late July 2020, when \u2014\u00a0according to KTTV \u2014 police determined that there was no \u201cattack.\u201d The staff member who prepared the drink unwittingly \u201cscooped up a cleaning cloth that had fallen into ice\u201d into the officer\u2019s drink.\u201cThe investigation was unable to prove malicious intent on the part of the store employee,\u201d Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing local officers, initially called the alleged incident a \u201cdisgusting assault on a police officer was carried out by someone with hatred in their heart.\u201dBut even before the company\u2019s statement, the claim of \u201cassault\u201d drew skepticism. Two separate news sites, Jezebel and Vice, conducted their own tests to see whether a tampon dipped into a Frappuccino would come out looking like the object in Melugin\u2019s photo. The results of both tests ran counter to police allegations. According to Jezebel\u2019s Megan Reynolds:The substance found in the Frappuccino does not resemble any sort of tampon that I\u2019ve ever used or seen in the wild. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s clumpy, and if you look at it quickly, resembles a cat hairball or maybe some paper towels. A tampon doesn\u2019t expand lengthwise and if it did, the shape would be uniform and not lumpen and irregular, as this item is. Tampons expand widthwise to accommodate a wide variety of body shapes and types. Everyone\u2019s vagina is different, but a tampon that resembled housing insulation or a long clot of cotton batting would be entirely ineffective.Meanwhile, Vice reported that the object posted in Melugin\u2019s photograph measured 4.957 inches, nearly an inch longer than the final length of the tampon the site used to recreate the alleged incident by soaking it in water and then leaving it inside a Frappuccino for two hours.\u201cSuspicious, but not outside the realm of possibility for a lesser-quality tampon,\u201d Vice noted. \u201cOther things to keep in mind is that it appears the very bottom of the tampon is cut off in the photo uploaded to Twitter, and we do not know what zoom the image was taken at.\u201dThe intentional poisoning claim from Los Angeles police came less than a month after police union officials in New York City accused workers at a Shake Shack restaurant in Manhattan of doing the same to their own colleagues. As the New York Post reported:A lieutenant from the Bronx blasted out an email to the unions that six cops \u201cstarted throwing up after drinking beverages they got from shake shack on 200 Broadway.\u201dIt was unclear why the sergeant and lieutenant escalated the situation.Detectives easily closed the case after interviewing five employees and reviewing surveillance footage showing the shakes were made normally, sources said.The machine was cleaned before the officers ordered, according to sources, and it still contained residual milkstone remover \u2014 a typically acidic solution used to combat buildup in dairy equipment.But by 10:45 p.m., the Detectives Endowment Association was declaring that Finest had become \u201cill\u201d after being \u201cintentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack\u201d \u2014 as Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch made a show of visiting Bellevue while his union declared at 10:47 p.m. that police officers came \u201cunder attack\u201d from a \u201ctoxic substance, believed to be bleach.\u201dThe allegation was debunked only one day later when Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison posted, \u201cAfter a thorough investigation by the NYPD\u2019s Manhattan South investigators, it has been determined that there was no criminality by shake shack\u2019s employees.\u201dIt is worth noting that the \u201cshunned policeman\u201d is a known urban legend \u2014 a subtheme of the \u201cshunned serviceman\u201d folklore.

The emphasis on \u201cmental health\u201d in all three reports appeared to stem from no more than the fact that it was the Counselling and Mental Health Center that was behind the program. In response to these misleading and sensationalist reports, the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT took the step of directly refuting the \u201cmental health issue\u201d claim in a statement posted on the school\u2019s web site: The MasculinUT program does not treat masculinity as a \u201cmental health issue,\u201d and any such statements are simply not accurate. It was established to bring more men to the table to address interpersonal violence, sexual assault and other issues. Like other UT programs related to sexual assault and interpersonal violence, MasculinUT is housed administratively in the university\u2019s Counseling and Mental Health Center. Its goals include helping men explore ways to reduce sexual violence, helping students take responsibility for their actions, and fostering healthier relationships on campus and beyond. Based on the promotional material and information on the MasculinUT web site, the closest the program\u2019s designers came to \u201ctreating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d was one section which listed \u201cemotional and mental health problems\u201d as one of four or five possible negative consequences of \u201cespousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity\u201d: Attending to masculinity can illuminate many important issues and take us a step closer to creating a dialogue for gender equity. Specifically for college students, research shows that espousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity results in men underperforming in college, participating in risky behavior that affects their health (such as binge drinking or drug use), and developing particular emotional and mental health problems that cannot be addressed unless we understand the specific vulnerabilities created by certain aspects of masculinity. The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine. This definition of masculinity also restricts what is acceptable in terms of appearance. This also makes it exclusionary, because a restrictive definition of masculinity depends on excluding people from that definition. Students who do not feel what a \u201creal man\u201d should feel, think the way a \u201creal man\u201d thinks, or looks the way a \u201creal man\u201d is supposed to look are vulnerable to violence from others who cannot accept male students who stray from this narrow definition. Students who feel targeted are also at risk of engaging in violent behavior in an attempt to not be the target of violence. Restricting the definition of masculinity can turn students into \u201cpressure cookers,\u201d where if a student is not allowed to express all of their emotions and thoughts, these just build up and can explode in various, unhealthy ways (such as violent behavior or coping mechanisms such as drinking). Since 2015, MasculinUT has been run by Voices Against Violence, an initiative overseen by the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT, which produces programming to prevent and respond to interpersonal violence, including sexual assault. The program appears to have come to prominence in April 2018, because of the launch of a new MasculinUT poster campaign, and because the University of Texas began advertising the position of\u00a0\u201chealthy masculinities coordinator\u201d at that time.","sources":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/foxandfriends\/status\/990577691723169793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/cmhc.utexas.edu\/vav\/vav_masculinut_restrictive.html, https:\/\/utdirect.utexas.edu\/apps\/hr\/jobs\/nlogon\/180326011533, https:\/\/t.co\/BtZdfclfMG, https:\/\/pjmedia.com\/trending\/university-of-texas-to-treat-masculinity-as-a-mental-health-issue\/, https:\/\/cmhc.utexas.edu\/vav\/vav_masculinut_why.html, https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180501193027\/https:\/\/cmhc.utexas.edu\/vav\/vav_masculinut.html, https:\/\/constitution.com\/liberals-at-ut-austin-want-masculinity-designated-as-a-mental-illness\/","label":2,"subjects":"Politics, constitution.com, fox and friends, pj media","__index_level_0__":8389,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThe plans and utterances of academics are a longstanding source of outrage for some right-wing and libertarian commentators in the United States, who often see college campuses as hotbeds of political correctness and the corrosion of traditional values.

The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine. This definition of masculinity also restricts what is acceptable in terms of appearance. This also makes it exclusionary, because a restrictive definition of masculinity depends on excluding people from that definition. Students who do not feel what a \u201creal man\u201d should feel, think the way a \u201creal man\u201d thinks, or looks the way a \u201creal man\u201d is supposed to look are vulnerable to violence from others who cannot accept male students who stray from this narrow definition. Students who feel targeted are also at risk of engaging in violent behavior in an attempt to not be the target of violence. Restricting the definition of masculinity can turn students into \u201cpressure cookers,\u201d where if a student is not allowed to express all of their emotions and thoughts, these just build up and can explode in various, unhealthy ways (such as violent behavior or coping mechanisms such as drinking). Since 2015, MasculinUT has been run by Voices Against Violence, an initiative overseen by the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT, which produces programming to prevent and respond to interpersonal violence, including sexual assault. The program appears to have come to prominence in April 2018, because of the launch of a new MasculinUT poster campaign, and because the University of Texas began advertising the position of\u00a0\u201chealthy masculinities coordinator\u201d at that time.n\nClaim: Liberals at the University of Texas called for masculinity to be designated a mental illness\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that liberals at the University of Texas called for masculinity to be designated as a mental illness is false. The evidence clearly indicates that the University of Texas' Counselling and Mental Health Center, through their MasculinUT program, did not treat or label masculinity as a mental health issue. Instead, the program was aimed at addressing issues like sexual assault and interpersonal violence by encouraging a healthier sense of masculinity. Misinterpretations and sensationalist reporting by certain media outlets contributed to the spread of this inaccurate claim. The university itself refuted these claims explicitly, stating that their program does not treat masculinity as a mental health issue."}

So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation\u2019s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. \"\"In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent,\"\" Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose\u00a0by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore\u2019s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging.

The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila\u2019s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization \"\"was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s.\"\" The IFC\u2019s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"\" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. \"\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\"\" Jones said. \"\"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"\" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. \"\"If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it\u2019s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,\"\" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before.

{"claim_id":10381,"hypothesis":"Chew On This: Sticking With Nicotine Gum for the Long Haul","date_published":"March 1, 2011","explanation_1":"The story explained in clear terms why nicotine gum is under scruitny right now and who is pushing for its expanded use. It listed many of the side effects of using the gum and explained nicotine addiction simply and elegantly. We wish, though, that it had presented more of the hard data from some of the studies that receive only fleeting mention, that it had provided cost information and that it had done more to discuss alternatives to nicotine gum. On the safety record for nicotine gum all we got in this story was one health behavior specialist saying, \u201cThere really doesn\u2019t appear to be any great harm.\u201d And a British regulatory proclamation that \u201cthere are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects.\u201d\u00a0 Statements like \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to be\u201d and \u201cno grounds to suspect\u201d could be haunting some day. The story states that NRT products have \u201camassed a strong safety record\u201d but we\u2019re never given any details. We also wish it had presented a more balanced perspective from the sources quoted. The two nicotine replacement users are probably not examples of how nicotine products are used widely. The use of nicotine replacement at high dose for 15 years is well outside any regulatory boundaries anywhere. As the story points out, \u201cAbout one in five American adults smokes\u2014a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004.\u201d As other studies have found, about 1 out of every 5 preventable deaths is also due to smoking. This is a massive public health challenge. People take up smoking and continue to do so despite the known risks for a variety of reasons. Just about 50% of smokers attempt to quit each year. Most fail. A major reason for the failure is the addictive power of nicotine. A story that highlights the public and personal health issues associated with smoking and smoking cessation is always welcome.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"The story did not discuss costs, and this was a missed opportunity. Cigarette smoking creates a huge burden on our health care system. The cost of the gum \u2013 $50 to $70 for a box of 100 pieces \u2013 may be a drop in the bucket compared to the costs of people developing cancer and other disorders from smoking. A study mentioned in the story has a nice section on costs that we wish the story had quoted: \u201c\u2026the incremental cost of extended versus standard therapy was $2482 per additional quitter at 24 weeks.\u201d The benefits are the whole reason for this story and yet they are not quantified in any way. The story says, \u201cA few studies have examined the use of NRT beyond the current recommendations. Last year, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania published a study in Annals of Internal Medicine that found that smokers who use a nicotine patch for 24 weeks may be more likely to stay off cigarettes than those treated for eight weeks.\u201d \u00a0Readers deserved to see the hard numbers. Although some potential harms are mentioned, none are quantified. The story states that NRT products \u201chave amassed a strong safety record\u201d but we never get any details on that record. We wish the story had delivered a deeper exploration than one health behavior specialist saying, \u201cThere really doesn\u2019t appear to be any great harm.\u201d And a British regulatory proclamation that \u201cthere are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects.\u201d\u00a0 Statements like \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to be\u201d and \u201cno grounds to suspect\u201d could be haunting some day. The story mentions numerous studies and could not possibly evaluate all of them in detail, but we felt that more time could have been spent with at least one or two of the studies to help readers understand the types of studies that have been done and the relative strength of the findings. The way the story reads, all the studies are essentially given equal weight. And then there is this curious bit of information. \u201cThe warnings date back to when nicotine gum first received FDA approval back in 1984. They weren\u2019t based on hard science connecting health hazards to long-term nicotine addiction, but were set to mirror the length of use in clinical trials.\u201d Were the clinical trials themselves not hard science? Wasn\u2019t this, in effect, a conservative approach based on what hard evidence was available? The University of Pennsylvania study, which studied the nicotine patch and not gum, failed to show any difference in smoking rates at the end of one year, even though it did show a difference up to the 24 weeks of treatment. So, the bottom line suggested in the story is that people are likely to stay off cigarettes as long as they can get nicotine in some other form. While that seems reasonable on face value, we are only given a couple of anecdotes and a partial rendering of a single study. The two anecdotes provided strongly suggest that continuing an ongoing use of nicotine replacement for years is both acceptable and safe. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. The story only quoted one scientist in a story that was ostensibly all about the science. Instead, it spent more time with nicotine gum users and a blogger. We thought that had more space been devoted to independent experts, the evidence would have been more clearly sorted out. We did appreciate, though, that the story took pains to point out the extent of drug industry funded research in this area. It says, for example, \u201cHowever, the study reported no difference in the quit rates of the two groups when they were checked at the one-year mark, revealing the fact that many people began smoking again. The senior author of the study, funded by federal grants, has served as a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline.\u201d The story did not do a good job comparing nicotine gum to going cold turkey, counseling or other therapies. Some of the studies mentioned talk about a combination of therapies that include gum and counseling. We would have liked to have seen a better comparison to give readers the best sense of what choice they should make if considering quitting smoking. The story makes it clear that these over-the-counter drugs are widely available and that Nicorette is the market leader. \u2018Glaxo products\u2014which include Nicorette gum and lozenges and NicoDerm patches\u2014account for more than half of the $835 million market in annual U.S. retail sales of over-the-counter smoking-cessation aids, according to market-research firm Euromonitor International. Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG also market NRT.\u201d The story does a good job establishing what\u2019s truly novel here \u2013 \u201cPublic health officials are backing away from recommending against the long-term use of nicotine gum, lozenges and patches. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to eliminate the 12-week warning and instead recommend nicotine-based quit-smoking aids for extended\u2014perhaps even permanent\u2014use.\u201d It\u2019s clear that the story didn\u2019t rely on any news release.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Wall Street Journal","__index_level_0__":1246,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThe story did not discuss costs, and this was a missed opportunity.

And then there is this curious bit of information. \u201cThe warnings date back to when nicotine gum first received FDA approval back in 1984. They weren\u2019t based on hard science connecting health hazards to long-term nicotine addiction, but were set to mirror the length of use in clinical trials.\u201d Were the clinical trials themselves not hard science? Wasn\u2019t this, in effect, a conservative approach based on what hard evidence was available? The University of Pennsylvania study, which studied the nicotine patch and not gum, failed to show any difference in smoking rates at the end of one year, even though it did show a difference up to the 24 weeks of treatment. So, the bottom line suggested in the story is that people are likely to stay off cigarettes as long as they can get nicotine in some other form. While that seems reasonable on face value, we are only given a couple of anecdotes and a partial rendering of a single study. The two anecdotes provided strongly suggest that continuing an ongoing use of nicotine replacement for years is both acceptable and safe. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. The story only quoted one scientist in a story that was ostensibly all about the science. Instead, it spent more time with nicotine gum users and a blogger. We thought that had more space been devoted to independent experts, the evidence would have been more clearly sorted out. We did appreciate, though, that the story took pains to point out the extent of drug industry funded research in this area. It says, for example, \u201cHowever, the study reported no difference in the quit rates of the two groups when they were checked at the one-year mark, revealing the fact that many people began smoking again. The senior author of the study, funded by federal grants, has served as a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline.\u201d The story did not do a good job comparing nicotine gum to going cold turkey, counseling or other therapies. Some of the studies mentioned talk about a combination of therapies that include gum and counseling. We would have liked to have seen a better comparison to give readers the best sense of what choice they should make if considering quitting smoking. The story makes it clear that these over-the-counter drugs are widely available and that Nicorette is the market leader. \u2018Glaxo products\u2014which include Nicorette gum and lozenges and NicoDerm patches\u2014account for more than half of the $835 million market in annual U.S. retail sales of over-the-counter smoking-cessation aids, according to market-research firm Euromonitor International. Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG also market NRT.\u201d The story does a good job establishing what\u2019s truly novel here \u2013 \u201cPublic health officials are backing away from recommending against the long-term use of nicotine gum, lozenges and patches. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to eliminate the 12-week warning and instead recommend nicotine-based quit-smoking aids for extended\u2014perhaps even permanent\u2014use.\u201d It\u2019s clear that the story didn\u2019t rely on any news release.n\nClaim: Chew On This: Sticking With Nicotine Gum for the Long Haul\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim 'Chew On This: Sticking With Nicotine Gum for the Long Haul' suggests that using nicotine gum for an extended period is being considered as a viable option. The evidence supports this partially as public health officials are indeed reconsidering the recommendations against long-term use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) like gum. However, the claim also implies safety and efficacy of long-term use, which the story critiques by highlighting the lack of detailed safety data and mixed results on efficacy (e.g., no difference in quit rates at the one-year mark in the University of Pennsylvania study). Therefore, while the claim is supported in terms of a shift in public health perspective, it lacks full support regarding the long-term effectiveness and safety of prolonged nicotine gum use."}

We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize.

But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun.

The Post determined that more than half of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients.

The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence.
