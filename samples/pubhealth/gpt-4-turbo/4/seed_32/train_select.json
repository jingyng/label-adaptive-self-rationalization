It plans by June to boost production to \u201chigh double-digit millions\u201d per month, with the tests due to be run on more than 40,000 of Roche\u2019s cobas e testing machines installed worldwide. The test identifies antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the body, suggesting possible immunity.

Diasorin SpA of Italy is among those developing an antibody test which it hopes to put to use this month.

This is in the right ballpark, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the best comparison. It seems to compare the number of beds at different times of the year, but the number available fluctuates seasonally. Comparing July-September in 2010 and 2017, the decrease in beds available overnight in England is closer to 13,200. 66 A&E and maternity wards have been closed. We don\u2019t know, as this information isn\u2019t collected nationally. In 2014, there were reportedly plans to close or downgrade 66 in England, but while some have been, others have stayed open. 103 NHS walk-in centres have closed or been downgraded since 2010. We don\u2019t know exactly, as this information isn\u2019t collected centrally. Research from an NHS regulator and from campaign group 38 Degrees suggests more than 90 have been closed or downgraded. 60 ambulance stations have closed since 2010. We don\u2019t know how many ambulance stations have closed since 2010 as national figures on this aren\u2019t regularly published. 1,000 GP practices have closed since 2010. There are around 1,000 fewer GP practices in England in 2017 than in 2010. Some practices may have merged together, rather than closing completely, but we don\u2019t know how many have done so. A&E four hour targets have been missed more than 10 million times since 2010. Correct. Between 2010\/11 and 2017\/18, around 12 million A&E attendances in England took over four hours from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. The number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&E is up 2,700% since 2010. Correct (although not all patients will necessarily have been waiting in A&E). In 2011\/12, 120 patients in England waited 12 hours between the decision to admit them to emergency admissions and their actual admission, compared to 3,500 in 2017\/18. Spending on social care is down 8% since 2010. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said that between 2009\/10 and 2016\/17, councils\u2019 spending on adult social care in England fell 8% in real terms.

{"claim_id":34167,"hypothesis":"U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. ","date_published":"October 23, 2019","explanation_1":"In reality, the only consistent feature of these incidents is the inconsistency of the circumstances and context that surrounded them. As such, it appears doubtful that Trump typically brandishes his middle finger as a way of expressing disdain or anger or disrespect. A far more plausible explanation appears to be simply that, from time to time, the president\u2019s hairline or eyebrows or skin cause him irritation or discomfort, and he feels compelled to scratch that itch.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made. Anti-gun violence activist Shannon Watts tweeted out a short video clip of the incident, writing: \u201cWhen gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u2018fix\u2019 his hair. How is this even real life?\u201d When gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u201cfix\u201d his hair. How is this even real life? pic.twitter.com\/9bnj7XfY1m \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 21, 2019 \u00a0 The left-leaning Facebook page The Other 98% repurposed Watts\u2019 viral tweet in a video:  Jack Brown, whose Twitter bio describes him as a \u201cbody language and emotional intelligence expert,\u201d posted a lengthy and widely shared analysis of the president\u2019s non-verbal gestures during the incident, concluding that: \u201cThis gesture is very much what it looks like \u2014 Donald Trump is giving Astronaut Jessica Meir the finger while she\u2019s walking in space. He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201d","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":5202,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made.

He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201dn\nClaim: U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that U.S. President Donald Trump intentionally used his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who corrected him cannot be confirmed due to the lack of definitive evidence about his intent behind the gesture.

The story unfolded when bystander video emerged of Clinton nearly fainting and stumbling from a curb before her aids loaded her into a van after a 9\/11 event in New York. The situation played into conspiracy theories that Clinton has been hiding a major medical condition, most likely Parkinson\u2019s disease. Clinton\u2019s doctor, Lisa Bardack, released a statement saying that Clinton had been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia during a follow up visit on Friday: She was put on antibiotics, and was advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at (Sunday\u2019s) event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.

But he didn't quite stay on message. Interviewer Matt Lauer began by asking Biden why the federal government wasn't closing the border between the United States and Mexico, where the outbreak began. \"\"We have contacted and been in constant contact with the leading health experts both in the world as well as here in the United States, and they have suggested that that is not the way we should move,\"\" Biden told Lauer. Lauer pressed Biden further on closing borders, saying, \"\"Let me ask this, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, I promise. But if a member of your family came to you ...\"\" \u2014 Biden laughs here \u2014 \"\"No, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?\"\" Biden: \"\"I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me. I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway. So from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing.\"\" That ended Lauer's flu questions. (His other questions were about the economy, Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch, and why Biden wasn't included among members of Obama's team named to  People  magazine's list of most beautiful people.) Within hours, Biden's spokesman sent out a statement: \"\"On the  Today Show  this morning the vice president was asked what he would tell a family member who was considering air travel to Mexico this week. The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick.\"\" We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin. The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. \"\"Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,\"\" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. \"\"The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings.\"\" We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze \"\"might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.\"\" \"\"Quite a bit of research indicates that,\"\" he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: \u2022 A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to \"\"a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis.\"\" \u2022 A 2003 study in the  New England Journal of Medicine  on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were \"\"clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft.\"\" \u2022 A 2005 study in  The Lancet  concluded, \"\"The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.\"\" That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 rubbing your eyes. \"\"If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane.\"\" If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was \"\"When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.\"\" That's just wrong.

Of course, we were curious, too, so we got to checking. Before we get to our findings, here's a little context about CNSNews.com for those \u2013 like us \u2013 who had not heard of it. CNSNews.com, based in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., says its goal is to \"\"provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission.\"\" It is not affiliated with Catholic News Service, which sometimes uses the same CNS abbreviation. First, we checked the larger context of the article to see if \"\"Obamacare\"\" (the Affordable Care Act) requires health insurers to cover sterilization. We made several calls before we finally came up with a solid source that confirmed the new law requires providers to cover sterilization without cost to the patient. According to the U.S. Health Resource and Services Administration, services that fall under \"\"women's preventive health care\"\" are supposed to be covered for free, including mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, contraception, sexually transmitted infection counseling and \u2013 yes \u2013\"\"sterilization procedures.\"\" As for the more salient detail \u2013 the age of consent in Oregon \u2013 we found a piece of Oregon law, which states that \"\"a minor 15 years of age or older may give consent, without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor, to: Hospital care, medical or surgical diagnosis or treatment by a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board \u2026\"\"  Essentially, CNSNews.com linked those two pieces of information \u2013 the new requirements that insurance companies cover sterilization for free and the fact that Oregon's age of consent for health care is 15 years old. The idea that 15-year-old girls would be lining up for free on-demand sterilizations struck our readers either as scary - \"\"Is this true?\"\" - or ridiculous - \"\"This can't be true.\"\" We kept reporting. We checked whether sterilization had always been covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state-run health care insurance program that covers 600,000 people a month. We called Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Alissa Robbins, who confirmed that it has been included since the plan's inception in 1994. We also asked how many 15-, 16 \u2013 and 17-year-olds had received sterilizations under the plan. Robbins checked records for the last 10 years and found no sterilization procedure for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old. As for 17-year-olds, she said, at most one such procedure is performed each year, though some years none is performed. She couldn't tell us the reason, she said, because it was \"\"protected health information.\"\" However, it seems clear to us that the procedure for young women in that age bracket is exceedingly rare. Robbins also pointed us to ORS 436, which lays out the warnings and consent procedures for anyone seeking sterilization, including minors. If a physician feels a minor is not capable of making an informed consent to be sterilized, her only recourse is to go to court and ask a judge to order that she is. We also checked with OHSU Hospital to see what the process would be for a minor looking to be sterilized there. Spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley got back to us with a lengthy email. For any patient under 30, she said, the hospital offers counseling about \"\"long-acting reversible contraceptives\"\" and \"\"the risk of regret\"\" in young women who are sterilized. The \"\"most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization,\"\" she wrote, \"\"is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening.\"\" If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. \"\"(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent.\"\" She ended on this note: \"\"The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient. It requires that insurance plans cover all contraceptives available.\"\" After some vacation phone tag, we were able to talk to Michael Chapman, the CNSNews.com managing editor who had worked closely with the story's author, an intern who is no longer there. \"\"Our story is factual,\"\" Chapman said. \"\"Out story reports what the law is in Oregon and it reports what the federal regulation is.\"\" Chapman said the article was stymied in part by little response from the Oregon Health Authority. \"\"It's great they're willing to say more now that the story has come out. \"\"Nearly all health insurers must provide sterilization ... that's a fact.\"\" In a subsequent email, Chapman pointed out language on the Oregon Health Authority's consent to sterilization form that reads \"\"I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me.\"\" The form is the last step in many checks and balances that is only signed after the patient finds a physician willing to perform the procedure. Now let's pull this together. Our reporting found that it's true that the health care act requires sterilizations to be free. It's also true that 15-year-olds can consent to health care without parental consent. But CNSNews.com goes even further by alleging that \"\"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.\"\" The statement would be accurate if it said health care plans in Oregon are required to pay for sterilizations for 15-year-old-girls. But instead, the statement confuses the insurers with providers \u2013 i.e. physicians \u2013 stating that 15-year-olds have \"\"complete control.\"\" That's not true. What a 15-year-old girl may want and what a medical provider is willing to do, at least in this case, are two very different things. Health care providers are under no obligation to provide sterilization on demand. In fact, free sterilization is not available on demand for 15-year-olds in Oregon. A 15-year-old must first convince a doctor that the procedure is medically necessary. While sometimes it is -- to treat cancer, for instance --a decade of records from the Oregon Health Plan and the explanation of procedures at OHSU show sterilization of 15-year-olds is incredibly rare. In Oregon, 15-year-old girls do not have \"\"complete control\"\" over whether to be sterilized.

Now let's pull this together. Our reporting found that it's true that the health care act requires sterilizations to be free. It's also true that 15-year-olds can consent to health care without parental consent. But CNSNews.com goes even further by alleging that \"\"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.\"\" The statement would be accurate if it said health care plans in Oregon are required to pay for sterilizations for 15-year-old-girls. But instead, the statement confuses the insurers with providers \u2013 i.e. physicians \u2013 stating that 15-year-olds have \"\"complete control.\"\" That's not true. What a 15-year-old girl may want and what a medical provider is willing to do, at least in this case, are two very different things. Health care providers are under no obligation to provide sterilization on demand. In fact, free sterilization is not available on demand for 15-year-olds in Oregon. A 15-year-old must first convince a doctor that the procedure is medically necessary. While sometimes it is -- to treat cancer, for instance --a decade of records from the Oregon Health Plan and the explanation of procedures at OHSU show sterilization of 15-year-olds is incredibly rare. In Oregon, 15-year-old girls do not have \"\"complete control\"\" over whether to be sterilized. We rule the statement .\"n\nClaim: \"CNSNews Says \"\"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"While Oregon law allows 15-year-olds to consent to medical treatments, including sterilization, without parental consent, the claim that they have 'complete control' over the decision to be sterilized is misleading. Health care providers are not obligated to perform sterilization simply because a minor consents to it. Providers consider medical necessity and ethical implications, and often require counseling or additional consent processes before proceeding with such a significant medical procedure. Furthermore, evidence suggests that sterilization procedures on 15-year-olds are exceedingly rare and typically involve significant medical justification. Thus, the claim exaggerates the level of control minors have over the decision to be sterilized, making it false."}

The \u00a0accompanying story was from CNSnews.com, a site operated by the conservative Media Research Center. \"\"Over 214,000 Doctors Opt Out of Obamacare Exchanges,\"\" read a headline on CNSnews.com. We found the source of the claim. It was coming from American Action Forum, a self-described \"\"center-right policy institute.\"\" The organization put out an analysis on Oct. 27 titled: \"\"Health Care Providers are Opting-Out of Obamacare Exchange Plans.\"\" How many? According to the post, \"\"as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products.\"\" It went on to list some reasons \"\"doctors are opting out of the exchange plans.\"\" That\u2019s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans.

{"claim_id":9083,"hypothesis":"Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit","date_published":"October 6, 2017","explanation_1":"Editor\u2019s note: On the day this\u00a0 review was published, the news release it\u2019s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke. Figuring out ways to persuade them to stop has merit.","fact_checkers":"Sharon Dunwoody, PhD,Karen Carlson, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"It is not made clear what costs would accompany this kind of mobile health message strategy, and whether the costs would be absorbed by health plans and health care providers that use the service, or by individual patients. Wide use presumes thousands of app downloads and significant infrastructure costs on the part of those maintaining the service. It\u2019s assumed there is profit motive, given the licensing agreement. The release appropriately describes the outcomes in absolute terms. For example, \u201c16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby.\u201d But while the body of the release clarifies that this difference between groups was not statistically significant, the headline and lead sentence gloss over this fact. We\u2019ll address that issue below under the Evidence criterion. There is no mention of harms but it\u2019s hard to imagine there are any harms from voluntarily receiving from 1 to 8 text messages a day. We\u2019ll rate this Not Applicable.

However, findings from such limited subgroups should be interpreted very cautiously, and a positive subgroup finding should never be the headline if the overall results of the study were negative.
