{"claim_id":14191,"hypothesis":"Hillary Clinton Says Donald Trump promised to repeal Obamacare, build a wall, ban Muslims, and more.","date_published":"May 5, 2016","explanation_1":"A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five\u00a0of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn\u2019t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate.","fact_checkers":"Jon Greenberg","premise":"\"Even before Donald Trump\u2019s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, \"\"Everything I say I\u2019m going to do folks, I do.\"\" It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We\u2019ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren\u2019t actually promises. We did not hear back. \u2018Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day\u2019 At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. \"\"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases,\"\" Trump said. \"\"My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\"\" The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, \"\"I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools.\"\" Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. \u2018Defund Planned Parenthood\u2019 Trump\u2019s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, \"\"Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,\"\" and then continued \"\"but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood.\"\" Trump\u2019s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. \u2018Repeal Obamacare\u2019 There doesn\u2019t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says \"\"On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\"\" \u2018Build a great great wall\u2019 Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn\u2019t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish \u2018a deportation force\u2019 There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said \"\"You\u2019re going to have a deportation force. And you\u2019re going to do it humanely.\"\" We couldn\u2019t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn\u2019t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, \"\"Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.\"\" Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, \"\"We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out.\"\" Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn\u2019t said if he would create a new deportation unit. While he might not be touting the same phrase, the result remains the same. \u2018Ban Muslims from entering the country\u2019 Immediately after the shootings by Muslim fundamentalists in San Bernardino in December 2015, the Trump campaign\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying, \"\"Donald Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\" Within a few days, Trump said\u00a0certain people would be exempted, including American citizens who are Muslim, foreign leaders, and athletes headed to competitions. However, according to the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0within his first 100 days \"\"the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place.\"\" That puts the ban firmly in the promise zone. \u2018Kill the spouses and children of our enemies\u2019 Trump said this during an interview on Fox and Friends, Dec. 2, 2015. \"\"The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,\"\" Trump said. In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump seemed to dial down this threat. O\u2019Reilly asked him if he would have killed members of the bin Laden family. Trump said \"\"I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer.\"\" Trump was pressed on this at the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. Asked how this policy would set the United States apart from ISIS, Trump said, \"\"We have to be much tougher.\"\" Trump finished his answer with, \"\"I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families\u2019 lives.\"\" While this could be a death threat, it isn\u2019t quite as clear as his original statement. Clearly, he wants to make family members suffer, but he doesn\u2019t say how much. Restore waterboarding and \u2018go further\u2019 In the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary, Trump said, \"\"I would bring back waterboarding and I\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\"\" Trump stood by his waterboarding policy on March 22, 2016, telling CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer he would \"\"go further.\"\" Trump has also said that \"\"torture works.\"\" The only caveat that Trump offered during his CNN interview is that he would listen to military officials\u2019 advice on the use of interrogation methods. Whether a Trump administration would ever use waterboarding, he has promised to keep it on the table. Our ruling A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five\u00a0of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn\u2019t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate.","sources":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/02\/07\/us\/politics\/transcript-of-the-republican-presidential-debate-in-new-hampshire.html, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/trump-says-torture-works-backs-waterboarding-and-much-worse\/2016\/02\/17\/4c9277be-d59c-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html, https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/12\/02\/politics\/donald-trump-terrorists-families\/, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/05\/05\/us\/politics\/donald-trump-president.html, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/post-politics\/wp\/2015\/12\/08\/donald-trump-explains-how-his-ban-on-muslims-entering-the-u-s-would-work\/, http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/624\/cpsprodpb\/E11D\/production\/_87092675_000001atrump.jpg, https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/10\/28\/donald-trump-mexico-going-to-pay-for-wall.html, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/the-fix\/wp\/2016\/02\/25\/the-cnntelemundo-republican-debate-transcript-annotated\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/HillaryClinton\/status\/727582702749159424, http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/video\/2015\/11\/11\/donald-trump-we-will-have-a-deportation-force\/, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2016\/05\/04\/a-simple-guide-to-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-to-america\/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_wonkblog-america1235p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory, https:\/\/twitter.com\/realdonaldtrump\/status\/683277309969694720, https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/positions\/healthcare-reform, https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2016\/may\/01\/ted-cruz\/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-planned-parenthood\/, https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2015\/dec\/17\/rand-paul\/rand-pauls-right-geneva-conventions-bar-donald-tru\/","label":0,"subjects":"Abortion, Immigration, National, Health Care, Human Rights, Islam, Foreign Policy, Religion, Terrorism, Guns, Hillary Clinton, ","__index_level_0__":2425,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"Even before Donald Trump\u2019s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, \"\"Everything I say I\u2019m going to do folks, I do.\"\" It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We\u2019ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren\u2019t actually promises. We did not hear back. \u2018Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day\u2019 At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. \"\"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases,\"\" Trump said. \"\"My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\"\" The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, \"\"I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools.\"\" Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. \u2018Defund Planned Parenthood\u2019 Trump\u2019s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, \"\"Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,\"\" and then continued \"\"but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood.\"\" Trump\u2019s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. \u2018Repeal Obamacare\u2019 There doesn\u2019t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says \"\"On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\"\" \u2018Build a great great wall\u2019 Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn\u2019t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish \u2018a deportation force\u2019 There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said \"\"You\u2019re going to have a deportation force. And you\u2019re going to do it humanely.\"\" We couldn\u2019t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn\u2019t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, \"\"Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.\"\" Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, \"\"We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out.\"\" Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn\u2019t said if he would create a new deportation unit.

According to the report, more than 9,000 children age 12 and younger died in a car crash from 2002 to 2011. \u201cThe good news is motor vehicle deaths decreased by 43 percent over the past decade for children age 12 and younger. The tragic news is still with that decrease, more than 9,000 kids were killed on the road in this period,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference. \u201cThousands of children are at risk on the road because they are not buckled up,\u201d he said. The study found that of the children who died between 2009 to 2010, a much higher proportion of black and Hispanic children were not buckled, compared with white kids. \u201cThe difference was nearly half (45 percent for blacks and 46 percent for Hispanics) versus a quarter (26 percent) for white kids,\u201d Frieden said. The study did not investigate why racial differences played such a big role in seat belt use, but it did suggest socio-economic factors may play a role. For the study, CDC researchers analyzed data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find the number of deaths among occupants in cars from 2002 to 2011 for all children aged up to the age of 12. Overall, 9,182 children died in car crashes during the period. But deaths dropped sharply, from 2.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002, to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2011, a 43 percent decline. According to the report, seat belt use increased from 88 percent in 2002 to 91 percent in 2011 among all children age 7 and under. The study also confirmed earlier findings that older children are less likely to be wearing seat belts than younger children. To prevent future deaths from car crashes, Frieden said parents should make sure their children use appropriate-sized car seats, booster seats and seat belts on every trip.

It did not specify which ones or when, saying this would depend on data continuing to show a slowdown in the spread of the new coronavirus. \u201cWe have to start reviving the economy while keeping the pandemic under control,\u201d said Prime Minister Antonio Costa shortly before parliament approved the third extension of the lockdown, now in place until May 2. Initially declared by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on March 18, the national lockdown restricted the movement of people and led thousands of businesses to suspend activities, especially in the restaurant and hotel sector. Costa said remote working should continue in the next month to contain the spread of the disease but said public services should be \u201cre-established\u201d and that he hoped childcare centres could reopen. Costa also said the government had approved plans to ensure masks and hand gel were available en masse in the coming fortnight. \u201cIt is fundamental to give the Portuguese the confidence to leave their homes and for this we must make means of protection abundant,\u201d he said. The municipality of Portimao in southern Portugal and the Madeira Islands said they would distribute 250,000 masks to their populations from next week, after health authorities reported on Monday they were considering making the use of masks obligatory in closed public spaces. Health Secretary Antonio Sales said on Wednesday Portugal\u2019s coronavirus curve had flattened due to the \u201cexcellent behaviour and civic-mindedness of the Portuguese people\u201d who obeyed the lockdown rules imposed by the government. The coronavirus outbreak has hit various sectors of the tourism-dependent, export-oriented economy.

What the story also tells is the complicated weighing of risks and benefits that parents may need to use, since the consumer tests and their laboratories are not regulated by the FDA. We would have liked more information in here about which precise forms of testing among the 57 studies analyzed were most reliable and the quality of the evidence in the Journal of the American Medical Association survey. Earlier sex-determination in pregnancy could lead to parents choosing (or trying to choose) the gender they prefer. Internationally, it is already clear that some parents in China and India are deliberately choosing male babies, and aborting female fetuses. The research reported on, a survey in the Journal of the American Medical Association, does not directly address these larger ethical implications. But the study\u2019s lead author, Diana Bianchi, does stress that she wants to examine \u201cwhy people are buying these things\u201d and the consequences of consumer access to over-the-counter testing for fetal gender. The New York Times story goes a bit further than the competing Reuters story in exploring how consumers may use the testing.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"The story quotes one price estimate of about $250 for the testing. We would have liked more detail about whether new details on accuracy of the tests might change their status in the marketplace, or whether insurability status might change. Parents who fear their child may inherit gender-linked disorders, such as hemophilia, could use this test earlier in pregnancy and possibly avoid more invasive procedures, such as amniocentesis. Amniocentesis carries a risk of miscarriage. We would have liked some numbers about how many women in the US are facing this dilemma; the situations that carry benefit are few. The average gestational \u201cage\u201d at enrollment in prenatal care in the US is after the window in which most of these tests are marketed. So that means if a couple did not know that they needed to think about X-linked mental retardation \u201cfragile X\u201d (which affect males) or hemophilia, the use of the test would not really be integrated into their care. Could have been more skeptical of why they are really being marketed \u2013 closer to entertainment ultrasounds than medical care. Yes, the story lists potential harms. These range from inaccuracy, because the tests are unregulated and the laboratories don\u2019t have to meet medical standards, to the potential for abortions based on fetal gender. This story does not evaluate the quality of the evidence in the new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which prompted the headlines. We applaud some of the details, giving consumers information about the lawsuit about one consumer product, but the discussion leaves readers confused about how to evaluate reliability.

Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"\"by land, not by sea,\"\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent. Smugglers\u2019 creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California. Our ruling Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn\u2019t been studying drug facts for nothing.\"n\nClaim: We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"entailment","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence supports the claim that heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 identifies Mexico as the main supplier of heroin to the United States, noting that 'Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market.' Additionally, the evidence mentions the significant role of Mexican 'transnational criminal organizations' in the drug trade and indicates that drugs, including heroin, predominantly enter the U.S. by land from Mexico, further validating the claim."}
{"claim_id":36157,"hypothesis":"An image shows a man's mostly-consumed Red Bull energy drink, after he found a dead mouse in the container.","date_published":"September 24, 2019","explanation_1":"Did a Man Find a Dead Mouse in a Nearly Empty Red Bull Can?","fact_checkers":"  Kim LaCapria  ","premise":"On September 5 2019, Facebook user Seth Bowman shared the following post (archived here), alongside a claim his Red Bull energy drink was contaminated by a dead mouse. According to Bowman\u2019s claim, he had nearly finished drinking the can of Red Bull when \u201cchunks\u201d alerted him to the presence of the former rodent:So I drank a whole Red Bull the other night at work and found this at the bottom. I\u2019ve tried contacting Red Bull and haven\u2019t heard a word back. So do me a favor and let\u2019s make this viral.Bowman requested that predictably disgusted Facebook users do him \u201ca favor\u201d and \u201cmake this viral\u201d; they did,\u00a0 sharing the post over 150,000 times. We did not see users sharing the post to Red Bull\u2019s social media accounts, nor did we find any public acknowledgement of Bowman\u2019s claim. A friend of the poster shared the claim to Reddit\u2019s r\/WTF, where readers were skeptical.Bowman was certainly not the first person to claim they found a dead rodent in a soft drink or energy drink. In a 1988 newspaper column, folklorist\u00a0Jan Harold Brunvand examined claims that at the time spread without Facebook or email, indicating they appeared to be as old as bottled soft drinks themselves, and instances of ostension \u2014 when people took the claim to real life.Brunvand explained how the stories existed on two levels \u2014 one being the claims as they appeared as early as 1914, and another being representative of our fears involving handing off the responsibility for food safety from our homes to faceless corporations:A search of published appeals-court records conducted in 1976 turned up 45 such cases against soda bottlers, the first in 1914. And one can only guess how many similar cases were never appealed or were settled out of court.Most of the people who tell the mouse-in-Coke legend don\u2019t know the legal history, though. What they do know is a good story, whether it\u2019s told by a friend, a neighbor or co-worker. The tellers assume that somewhere, sometime, an actual lawsuit was brought against a soft-drink bottling company.So while the lawsuits are real, the stories are not, because they are so far separated from the original facts that they\u2019ve turned into folklore. In this way, a story can be both an actual event and a legend. And the mouse-in-Coke legends, like most urban legends, have lives of their own completely separate from the facts.What has occurred, I believe, is something like this: The theme of foreign matter contaminating food is a popular one in urban legends. And \u201cCoke\u201d has become virtually a generic way to refer to soft drinks. So the legends get started and gain credibility from lawsuits that people vaguely remember, in which mice were said to be found in soda bottles. And naturally, it is usually Coke that is mentioned in the legend whether or not the original suits were against Coke.As the legend spreads by word of mouth, the trauma is exaggerated, the drama heightened. And the size of the settlement, of course, grows and grows. The end result: The indignation against the giant corporation that is selling contaminated food is pumped up to a full measure of outrage.In 2016, The Verge published a \u201cbrief history\u201d of viral claims about dead mice or rats in sodas and energy drinks. Following yet another claim involving a deceased rodent and Dr. Pepper, the news organization examined several such claims, many of which appeared in 2012.The article referenced a notable 2012 lawsuit against PepsiCo, brought by a man who alleged he found a dead mouse in a can of Mountain Dew:Ronald Ball, 52, from Madison County, Ill., claims he tasted something foul in the can of drink he purchased from a vending machine at his work.According to his lawsuit, Ball claims he spat out the soda, the Madison County Record reported. He said he \u201ctook a drink, and immediately became violently ill such that he began to vomit \u2026\u00a0The contents of said can of Mountain Dew were immediately poured into a Styrofoam cup wherein a dead mouse was found,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.Ball sent the mouse to PepsiCo \u2014 along with a letter of complaint \u2014 but the oil company worker says the soda giant destroyed the body of the mouse, and therefore, his evidence.The incident happened in November 2009 and Ball [was] seeking $50,000 damages.Ball\u2019s suit led to a rather nauseating spate of articles about whether the composition of Mountain Dew would degrade or preserve the corpse of a small animal, with lawyers arguing that the beverage would rapidly dissolve a mouse\u2019s remains:Key to Pepsi\u2019s legal argument is that there\u2019s no chance a mouse\u2019s corpse could survive, intact, for 15 months swimming in Mountain Dew. While published studies have not been conducted on how rapidly Mountain Dew would dissolve a mouse, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the neon green soda can eat away teeth and bones in a matter of months, and would likely do quite a number on a rodent.\u201cI think it is plausible that it could dissolve a mouse in a few months,\u201d said Yan-Fang Ren of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who has studied the effects of citric acid on bones and teeth. \u201cBut dissolving [the mouse] does not mean it will disappear, because you\u2019ll still have the collagen and the soft tissue part. It will be like rubber.\u201dA similar claim was reported in 2011, involving the Monster brand of energy drinks. Another brand of energy drink was at the center of similar claims in 2016, when a consumer was purportedly sickened by a dead mouse in a beverage can:[Jordan] Bell started dry heaving and went straight to a doctor, who advised he go to the hospital. At the Mission Hospital they contacted BC Poison Control and told Bell that in about 24 hours he would probably experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.And in March 2018, an Arkansas Red Bull drinker reported finding a rodent at the bottom of his can. His claim went viral on Facebook, but many users were skeptical of its legitimacy:While [claimant Josh] Henley said it was not possible the rodent got inside the can when he left it in the car overnight, many people on social media said it was the highest possibility.The video, which was shared [in March 2018], went viral and was viewed more than 100,000 times and counting. It was first shared by Henley on Facebook.Some social media users also raised doubts about the legitimacy of the video.Joshua Nightingale commented: \u201cYou drank it last night, most likely that mouse got in after you drank it and went to sleep. Wouldn\u2019t you have noticed it last night after or while you were drinking it?\u201d Another comment said: \u201cIt obviously went in after you drank it.\u201dIn a statement to Mirror Online, a spokesman for Red Bull said: \u201cIt is inconceivable that a particle \u2014 let alone anything like this \u2014 could pass through the process of world-class, modern beverage manufacture.\u201dIn April 2017, beverage corporation lawyers once again argued the claims were impossible, and that the specimen was not sufficiently decomposed:[The claimant was] suing Coca-Cola for a modest amount, having medical bills related to his illness that total around $1,000, and he missed 60 hours of work. He also says that he lost thirty pounds due to his illness.Coca-Cola, however, disputes that it\u2019s possible to find such an intact mouse in one of its beverage cans. In the time that it would take for a mouse to be sealed inside a can at a bottling plant, then for the can to be distributed to a retail store and purchased, the mouse would have decomposed enough to have \u201ccompromised the can,\u201d or given off gases that would make the can bulge or burst.An attorney from Minnesota who is on the team representing Coke explained to the Mitchell Republic that the company \u201ctakes these cases extremely seriously and tries them all,\u201d since allegations of mouse contamination are damaging to its brand. Settling for a modest amount would be cheaper and easier, but the company would rather defend itself at trial \u2026 The plaintiff is seeking $2,026 and general damages, plus interest.That coverage raised two interesting aspects about dead-mouse-in-soda-can claims: that beverage companies maintain that they always take such suits to trial, and tacitly that claims of this sort seem to be somewhat common. It also appears that beverage manufacturers often feel confident rodent-in-soda claims are unlikely to hold up in court. The outlet quoted above also linked to a similar legal claim, with findings that the creature was a \u201ctoad\u201d and that no mechanism for its presence was ever determined.In 2012, however, Ball\u2019s claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and it was conditional in part on PepsiCo disclaiming responsibility. The 2009 case involving what appeared to be a toad yielded little useful information with respect to such contamination and how it might occur. At the time, a PepsiCo spokesman declined via email to speculate on how the toad got there:The FDA also conducted an investigation at the local Pepsi bottling plant in Orlando from August 4 to 11 [2009] and \u201cdid not find any adverse conditions or association to this problem,\u201d spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said.\u201cWe have not determined when or how the contamination occurred,\u201d DeLancey said in an e-mail.Pepsi says the FDA results \u201caffirmed\u201d the company\u2019s confidence \u201cin the quality of our products and the integrity of our manufacturing system,\u201d according to spokesman Jeff Dahncke.\u201cThe speed of our production lines and the rigor of our quality control systems make it virtually impossible for this type of thing to happen in a production environment. In fact, there never has been even a single instance when a claim of this nature has been traced back to a manufacturing issue \u2026\u00a0The FDA conducted a thorough inspection of our Orlando facility and found no cause for concern. In this case, the FDA simply was unable to determine when or how the specimen entered the package.\u201dWhen asked if Pepsi believed it was not responsible for the animal getting into the can, Dahncke said, \u201cWe have addressed the facts of the investigation and stated our position. It\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment beyond that.\u201dA September 2019 Facebook post claiming a user found a dead mouse in his can of Red Bull was virally popular, but neither unique in structure nor even as it pertained to Red Bull. Stories about dead rodents in bottled or canned soft drinks date back more than a century, and occasionally cross from the realm of folklore into the news by way of claims like the one to hand. A great many stories about a dead mouse in soda are just stories, but a few escalated to lawsuit levels.We contacted Red Bull to determine if Bowman formally submitted his claim, but have not yet received a response.","sources":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180101100340\/http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2009\/US\/09\/02\/frog.pepsi.can\/index.html, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/tag\/ostension, https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/can-mountain-dew-really-dissolve\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=2341113932605270&set=p.2341113932605270&type=3&theater, https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/5\/11\/11657586\/rat-mouse-found-in-pepsi-dr-pepper-can-rodent-soda-container-history, https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2011\/03\/30\/lawsuit-mans-monster-energy-drink-flavored-with-dead-mouse\/, https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2017\/04\/27\/coca-cola-dead-mouse-was-too-fresh-to-be-found-in-a-coke-can\/, https:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/watch-dead-rat-found-inside-red-bull-can-viral-video-2662931, https:\/\/www.beveragedaily.com\/Article\/2012\/08\/08\/Mountain-Dew-mouse-case-dissolves-as-PepsiCo-settles, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/washington-man-finds-dead-mouse-in-energy-drink-can, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/lawsuit-man-claims-he-became-ill-after-discovering-mouse-in-soda, https:\/\/archive.fo\/e6Qyj, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-greta-thunberg-make-a-face-when-she-saw-donald-trump\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Did+a+Man+Find+a+Dead+Mouse+in+a+Nearly+Empty+Red+Bull+Can%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-a-man-find-a-dead-mouse-in-a-nearly-empty-red-bull-can%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WTF\/comments\/d01vh0\/my_friend_found_a_friend_in_his_redbull\/, https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2009\/09\/good-newsthat-dead-mouse-in-your-diet-pepsi-was-actually-a-toad.html, https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/2515254\/dead-mouse-no-hit-with-energy-drinker\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-a-man-find-a-dead-mouse-in-a-nearly-empty-red-bull-can%2F, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-a-man-find-a-dead-mouse-in-a-nearly-empty-red-bull-can%2F, https:\/\/www.deseret.com\/1988\/4\/8\/18762948\/dead-mouse-in-coke-legends-have-lots-of-fizz-but-no-facts, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-a-man-find-a-dead-mouse-in-a-nearly-empty-red-bull-can%2F, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-a-man-find-a-dead-mouse-in-a-nearly-empty-red-bull-can%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/were-there-no-flags-at-the-democratic-debate\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":1,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":8623,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn September 5 2019, Facebook user Seth Bowman shared the following post (archived here), alongside a claim his Red Bull energy drink was contaminated by a dead mouse.

Although the company said it is\u00a0\u201cfully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion\u201d and that it expects to complete construction of the pipeline \u201cwithout any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe,\u201d it did not indicate any plans were in place to move ahead in violation of the referenced \u201cpolicy decision.\u201d The\u00a0statement also did not indicate that the company intended to incur a $50,000 daily fine and continue DAPL construction\u00a0without the easement. That aspect of the claim mirrored age-old urban legends involving a wealthy entity opting to pay fines to the detriment of public health, a rumor that dates back to at least 2005 and (falsely) attributes\u00a0similar behavior to Coca-Cola.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 4 December 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement necessary for Energy Transfer Partners to complete the Dakota Access pipeline, seemingly bringing an end to months of protests over the project. By the next day, widespread rumors asserted that the decision was not as final as it seemed. In the above-reproduced examples from\u00a0e-mail and social media,\u00a0claims\u00a0have appeared that\u00a0DAPL was \u201cstill under active construction,\u201d and that Energy Transfer Partner had opted to incur a $50,000 daily fine for continuing construction on the pipeline. No specifics accompanied the rumor, such as how the\u00a0fine might be incurred, or what would happen if DAPL were constructed without the approval to do so. One version\u00a0of the rumor referenced a statement purportedly issued by ETP on the ACOE\u2019s DAPL decision of 4 December 2016: Just spoke to Matt who is standing at the front line right now. Easement was denied, however DAPL released a statement saying that they will continue drilling and just pay the $50,000 a day fine. We are not free of this black snake yet, relatives. Late on 4 December 2016, ETP did release a statement on the ACOE\u2019s denial of the necessary easement: Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) and Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (NYSE: SXL) announced that the Administration\u2019s statement today that it would not at this time issue an \u201ceasement\u201d to Dakota Access Pipeline is a purely political action \u2013 which the Administration concedes when it states it has made a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d \u2013 Washington code for a political decision. This is nothing new from this Administration, since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office. For more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules. The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. The Corps\u2019 review process and its decisions have been ratified by two federal courts. The Army Corps confirmed this again today when it stated its \u201cpolicy decision\u201d does \u201cnot alter the Army\u2019s position that the Corps\u2019 prior reviews and actions have comported with legal requirements.\u201d In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline. The White House\u2019s directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency. The statement\u2019s final paragraph indicated that ETP was not giving up on DAPL, but in no part\u00a0of that statement did they say that\u00a0the company would continue to drill. However, it did say that they plan to finish construction of the pipeline as planned, without providing details: As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. It is possible that the company\u2019s statement alongside a clearly speculative response\u00a0shared\u00a0(but not written) by prominent protester Dallas Goldtooth prompted the rumor: WILL THIS ACTUALLY STOP CONSTRUCTION? Debatable. It would be illegal for Energy Transfer Partners to drill under the Missouri, but that\u2019s not to say they won\u2019t do it and opt to pay whatever legal penalties they incur. That would be a fairly shocking move on their part but they\u2019ve hinted they may be open to doing it. It\u2019s easy to imagine that an incoming Trump administration would do their best to make the penalties as minimal as possible.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics Legal, army corps of engineers, dakota access pipeline, dapl","__index_level_0__":3109,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn 4 December 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement necessary for Energy Transfer Partners to complete the Dakota Access pipeline, seemingly bringing an end to months of protests over the project. By the next day, widespread rumors asserted that the decision was not as final as it seemed.

One version\u00a0of the rumor referenced a statement purportedly issued by ETP on the ACOE\u2019s DAPL decision of 4 December 2016: Just spoke to Matt who is standing at the front line right now.

{"claim_id":34611,"hypothesis":"A Texas man found a dead rat in a partially consumed bottle of Dr Pepper.","date_published":"May 11, 2016","explanation_1":"As of 11 May 2016, Dr Pepper dispatched a courier to Graves\u2019 location to collect the rat and purportedly contaminated Dr. Pepper bottle for independent third-party testing; Graves refused the pickup attempt. No information is currently\u00a0available as to whether Graves and the brand managed to come to an agreement about circumstances under which the specimen could be tested, and the claim remains unproven.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 9 May 2016, a Texas man named John Graves published several photographs to Facebook alongside a claim that he had discovered a dead rat in his grandson\u2019s partially-consumed bottle of Dr Pepper: Graves\u2019 status update read: Nothing like your grandson drinking half a Dr Pepper only to find a dead rat floating on the bottle. Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax.

Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman\u2019s 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy\u2019s chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny. Yet another, similar claim was disproven after experts said that\u00a0Mountain Dew\u00a0(and other soft drinks)\u00a0could dissolve a mouse, thanks to the acids that incorporated into their flavoring agents to give them a tanginess and bite.

Although Dr Pepper has deemed such an occurrence 'virtually impossible' due to their stringent bottling processes, they have also expressed willingness to test the bottle and rat to determine the validity of the claim. However, without conclusive results from independent testing or an investigation that confirms how the rat could have entered the bottle, there is not enough information to definitively declare the claim true or false."}

{"claim_id":38992,"hypothesis":"\u00a0 A Germanwings airbus crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people was an act of terror because Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam before the crash. ","date_published":"March 30, 2015","explanation_1":"Germanwings Pilot Had Converted to Islam-Investigation Pending!","fact_checkers":"  Rich Buhler & Staff  ","premise":"There has been a lot of speculation about why Germanwings co-pilot Andrea Lubitz intentionally flew an airplane into a mountain, but there\u2019s no clear answer yet. The Germanwings airbus crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015. Two days later, Germanwings  said in a statement that the crash \u201cappeared\u201d to be a deliberate act by co-pilot Andrea Lubitz: \u201cWe are horrified to discover today that the aircraft that crashed in the south of France appears to\u00a0have been crashed deliberately \u2013 probably by the co-pilot of flight 4U9525. Based on audio taken\u00a0from the voice recorder, the French authorities have come to the conclusion that after the aircraft\u00a0had reached cruising altitude, the captain left the cockpit for a short time and was then unable to re-enter. It appears that the co-pilot, who had stayed in the cockpit, prevented the captain from re-entering by fully locking the cockpit door in order to then initiate the fatal descent. All Germanwings\u00a0and Lufthansa employees are deeply shocked. We could never have imagined that a tragedy like\u00a0this could occur within our company.\u201d It\u2019s not yet known why Andreas Lubitz would deliberately fly the plane into the side of a mountain. Early reports indicated that Lubitz had been treated for mental illness in the past and had previously attempted suicide.

Early indicators suggest that Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental illness and that led him to deliberately crash the airplane.

The Germanwings airbus crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015. Two days later, Germanwings  said in a statement that the crash \u201cappeared\u201d to be a deliberate act by co-pilot Andrea Lubitz: \u201cWe are horrified to discover today that the aircraft that crashed in the south of France appears to\u00a0have been crashed deliberately \u2013 probably by the co-pilot of flight 4U9525. Based on audio taken\u00a0from the voice recorder, the French authorities have come to the conclusion that after the aircraft\u00a0had reached cruising altitude, the captain left the cockpit for a short time and was then unable to re-enter. It appears that the co-pilot, who had stayed in the cockpit, prevented the captain from re-entering by fully locking the cockpit door in order to then initiate the fatal descent.

{"claim_id":34166,"hypothesis":"In October 2019, the Rev. Robert Morey of St. Anthony's parish in Florence, South Carolina, refused former Vice President Joe Biden the Catholic rite of communion.","date_published":"October 30, 2019","explanation_1":"Until and unless we receive information that corroborates Morey\u2019s account.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights. The story was covered by several major national news outlets\u00a0but originated in a statement sent to the Florence Morning News by Robert Morey, a priest in the Catholic parish of St. Anthony in Florence, South Carolina. On Oct. 28, the Morning News reported that: Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church\u2019s 9 a.m. Mass\u2026 \u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Morey told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey added. Asked by Snopes to confirm, deny, or clarify Morey\u2019s account, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment on the story. Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":7484,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of news reports that claimed former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had been refused communion by a Catholic priest in South Carolina on the basis of Biden\u2019s support for abortion rights. The story was covered by several major national news outlets\u00a0but originated in a statement sent to the Florence Morning News by Robert Morey, a priest in the Catholic parish of St. Anthony in Florence, South Carolina. On Oct. 28, the Morning News reported that: Former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race, was denied Holy Communion on Sunday morning at a Florence church. Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church confirmed Monday afternoon that he had denied the presidential candidate Holy Communion because of his stance on abortion. Biden, a lifelong Catholic, had attended the church\u2019s 9 a.m. Mass\u2026 \u201cSadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse Holy Communion to former Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Morey told the Morning News via email. \u201cHoly Communion signifies we are one with God, each other and the Church. Our actions should reflect that. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching.\u201d Morey said that as a priest, it is his responsibility to minister to those souls entrusted to his care and that he must do so in even the most difficult situations. \u201cI will keep Mr. Biden in my prayers,\u201d Morey added. Asked by Snopes to confirm, deny, or clarify Morey\u2019s account, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign declined to comment on the story. Biden himself did likewise on Oct. 29, during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss that, that\u2019s just my personal life and I\u2019m not going to get into that at all.\u201d In the Catholic tradition, Holy Communion (or eucharist) is an important rite that symbolizes the Last Supper and the sacrifice made by Christ on the cross, with communicants receiving the \u201cbody and blood\u201d of Christ (sacramental bread or wafer and sacramental wine). In a typical Catholic mass, the eucharist is the portion of the liturgy during which mass-goers are most openly visible to each other. Those who are receiving communion (and are physically able) leave their seats and stand in a line leading to the altar, where a priest or bishop, or a specially designated layperson, administers the sacrament by placing the host (consecrated bread) either in their hand or on their tongue. If Morey refused Biden communion at the altar (that is, at the point where the communicant receives the host), it\u2019s quite likely this denial would have been seen by others in attendance at the mass. To a devout Catholic, such a gesture would likely be extremely embarrassing and deeply wounding. However, no witness accounts or other corroborating evidence have so far emerged. That doesn\u2019t mean the incident did not occur. It\u2019s perfectly plausible, for example, that Morey might have gone to Biden or his aides before mass started and quietly informed them he would not administer communion to him. In that way, the refusal would not have been witnessed by a third party. We put a series of questions to Morey requesting details about the sequence of events, including whether any third parties actually witnessed his purportedly refusing Biden the eucharist. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to contact Morey, we did not receive a response of any kind. We also contacted the Diocese of Charleston, the administrative subdivision of the church that oversees Morey\u2019s parish, asking several questions and attempting to obtain information or details that might corroborate and verify Morey\u2019s account. A spokesperson for the diocese did not respond to our questions but instead repeatedly directed us to Morey himself. Morey\u2019s account, which was the sole basis of the multiple news reports that followed, remains unverified. The alleged other party in the purported incident, Biden, is declining to comment and therefore has not confirmed anything, and neither Morey nor his employer, the diocese, responded to our requests for further information. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Morey might have fabricated or exaggerated or misrepresented the incident in some way based on a preexisting ideological antipathy towards Biden or the Democratic party. First, Morey\u2019s very explanation of his purported actions (\u201cAny public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of Church teaching\u201d) clearly indicates at the very least a strong, preexisting disagreement with Biden, on his part, with regard to reproductive-health issues. Second, Morey has in the recent past made donations to Republican political campaigns \u2014 contributing to the presidential primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2015, and to the primary campaign of then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in 2011. We found no record of Morey having contributed to Democratic candidates. This indicates clear, preexisting support, on Morey\u2019s part, for the political party opposite to Biden\u2019s. Those facts might not have any significance, and Morey might well have been entirely accurate in his account. However, such background details necessarily mean it is appropriate to reserve judgement on the accuracy of what he presented as having happened. If information emerges that corroborates Morey\u2019s account, we will update this fact check accordingly. Church leaders and clergy members in the United States have, from time to time, refused the eucharist to pro-choice politicians (or threatened to refuse it). In 2004, Catholic bishops warned Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that he would be denied communion based on his political support for abortion rights and stem cell research, which the church also opposes. In 2008, the Bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Joseph Martino, made various statements suggesting that then vice-presidential candidate Biden, a native of the city, should be barred (or should refrain) from taking communion, based on his support for abortion rights. Martino also suggested that anyone within the diocese of Scranton who even voted for the Obama-Biden ticket should not receive communion. The following year, Martino went so far as to suggest that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, was not \u201cworthy to receive communion.\u201d Casey is famously an avowedly pro-life Democrat, one of very few in national politics, but his purported malfeasance in that instance was voting in the Senate to confirm Kathleen Sebelius, who holds strong pro-choice views, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These interventions might suggest that the Catholic church has a clear-cut policy on the question of refusing communion to pro-choice politicians, and that there is a straightforward, linear relationship between professing views that go against church teaching, and being denied the sacraments. The reality is much more complicated, and Morey \u2014 if he did refuse Biden communion \u2014 may even have violated church law himself. Catholic doctrine forbids abortion. The church\u2019s catechism states: \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person \u2014 among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life \u2026 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d Canon law explicitly states that anyone who procures an abortion (or directly assists in one, such as a doctor) is automatically excommunicated, and therefore ineligible to receive the sacraments, including communion. (Canon 1398: \u201cA person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\u201d) However, the question of whether a Catholic public figure who supports or advocates for abortion rights can be excommunicated or denied communion, within the tenets of Church law, is the subject of significant dispute within the Catholic church. It\u2019s not a debate we\u2019ll outline in this article, but good introductory explanations of the legal and doctrinal principles involved can be found here, here and here. Canon 912 of the Code of Canon Law states that, \u201cAny baptized person not prohibited by law can and must be admitted to holy communion.\u201d This places an obligation on a clergy member or eucharistic minister to administer the sacrament of communion unless the person seeking it has, according to Canon 915, \u201cbeen excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or declaration of the penalty\u201d or is \u201cobstinately persevering in manifest grave sin.\u201d We asked Morey for his precise reasoning in purportedly denying Biden communion, and we also asked the diocese of Charleston whether Morey had, in the view of the diocese, acted in accordance with canon law, if he did refuse Biden the sacrament, and whether (in Morey\u2019s words) \u201cadvocating for abortion\u201d was officially sufficient grounds, in the diocese of Charleston, for being denied communion. Furthermore we asked both Morey and the diocese whether he had acted independently or under instruction from someone else within the church hierarchy. Neither Morey nor the diocese answered any of our questions, and a spokesperson for the diocese repeatedly referred our questions to Morey, even though it was pointed out to them that some of those questions were specific to the diocese. News reports in October 2019 claimed that a Catholic priest in South Carolina, Robert Morey, had refused Biden communion on Sunday, Oct. 27. The only source for that claim was a statement written by the priest himself. Morey might well have given an accurate account of what took place that morning, but we cannot verify its accuracy for several reasons: The only other party to the alleged incident was Biden, and he has declined to comment; no witnesses have so far publicly corroborated Morey\u2019s account; we asked Morey and his employer, the Charleston diocese, to provide further corroborating details, but they failed to do so; and Morey\u2019s past political contributions and strong, pre-existing disagreement with Biden on abortion rights mean that a plausible motive exists, in principle, for Morey to seek to embarrass or harm Biden\u2019s reputation, although we have no specific evidence that those factors did, in fact, inform Morey\u2019s actions.n\nClaim: In October 2019, the Rev.

Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa.

Egregious example of misinformation and manipulation. pic.twitter.com\/mrBXhyeb37\u2014 It's Going Down (@IGD_News) June 2, 2020@IGD_News referenced a June 2 2020 Fox News article\u00a0(\u201cAntifa arrests coming, concerns over riots heading to suburbia, government source says\u201d) which essentially served as an in-print version of the same rumor. Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa. Two days later, Twitter nuisance Jack Posobiec and Fox News spread iterations of the claim; predictably, no such \u201cinvasion\u201d came to pass. A similar and likely directly related rumor circulated about \u201cantifa buses\u201d in Ada, Oklahoma, and it too was false. In particular, the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor posed a risk to customers of U-Haul, who were at risk specifically if they were moving into a new neighborhood where the rumor had taken root.Comments\"n\nClaim: \"Antifa is renting U-Hauls to quietly infiltrate \"\"residential neighborhoods\"\" for \"\"attacks.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that 'Antifa is renting U-Hauls to quietly infiltrate residential neighborhoods for attacks' originated from an unsourced social media post and was further spread by dubious sources, including a Fox News article citing anonymous sources. Additionally, NBC News reported that a similar rumor was propagated by a fake Twitter account linked to the white supremacist group Identity Evropa, which was designed to incite fear and violence under the guise of 'antifa' activities. This misinformation was intended to fuel tensions rather than report factual events. No verifiable evidence supports the claim, and it aligns with patterns of disinformation historically debunked in similar contexts."}

Reporter Bill Melugin posted a photograph of the alleged tampon on Twitter:The officer was reportedly not wearing his uniform and paid for the drink with a debit card issued by a police credit union.We contacted Target seeking comment; the company sent us the same statement it gave to KTTV:We take this allegation seriously. We have reviewed video footage and have not found any suspicious behavior. We have shared the video with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and look forward to the conclusions of their investigation.Reached for comment and asked how the officer determined that the alleged object was a tampon, the sheriff\u2019s department also shared a statement:Walnut Station Detectives are investigating an incident of alleged poisoning of food or drink at a local business. The incident was reported to have occurred Friday, June 19, 2020 at approximately 2:30p.m., on the 700 block of Grand Avenue in the city of Diamond Bar. The victim as a male White 36 years-old. This is an ongoing investigation. No further information is available at this time.The claim was formally debunked in late July 2020, when \u2014\u00a0according to KTTV \u2014 police determined that there was no \u201cattack.\u201d The staff member who prepared the drink unwittingly \u201cscooped up a cleaning cloth that had fallen into ice\u201d into the officer\u2019s drink.\u201cThe investigation was unable to prove malicious intent on the part of the store employee,\u201d Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing local officers, initially called the alleged incident a \u201cdisgusting assault on a police officer was carried out by someone with hatred in their heart.\u201dBut even before the company\u2019s statement, the claim of \u201cassault\u201d drew skepticism. Two separate news sites, Jezebel and Vice, conducted their own tests to see whether a tampon dipped into a Frappuccino would come out looking like the object in Melugin\u2019s photo. The results of both tests ran counter to police allegations. According to Jezebel\u2019s Megan Reynolds:The substance found in the Frappuccino does not resemble any sort of tampon that I\u2019ve ever used or seen in the wild. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s clumpy, and if you look at it quickly, resembles a cat hairball or maybe some paper towels. A tampon doesn\u2019t expand lengthwise and if it did, the shape would be uniform and not lumpen and irregular, as this item is. Tampons expand widthwise to accommodate a wide variety of body shapes and types. Everyone\u2019s vagina is different, but a tampon that resembled housing insulation or a long clot of cotton batting would be entirely ineffective.Meanwhile, Vice reported that the object posted in Melugin\u2019s photograph measured 4.957 inches, nearly an inch longer than the final length of the tampon the site used to recreate the alleged incident by soaking it in water and then leaving it inside a Frappuccino for two hours.\u201cSuspicious, but not outside the realm of possibility for a lesser-quality tampon,\u201d Vice noted. \u201cOther things to keep in mind is that it appears the very bottom of the tampon is cut off in the photo uploaded to Twitter, and we do not know what zoom the image was taken at.\u201dThe intentional poisoning claim from Los Angeles police came less than a month after police union officials in New York City accused workers at a Shake Shack restaurant in Manhattan of doing the same to their own colleagues. As the New York Post reported:A lieutenant from the Bronx blasted out an email to the unions that six cops \u201cstarted throwing up after drinking beverages they got from shake shack on 200 Broadway.\u201dIt was unclear why the sergeant and lieutenant escalated the situation.Detectives easily closed the case after interviewing five employees and reviewing surveillance footage showing the shakes were made normally, sources said.The machine was cleaned before the officers ordered, according to sources, and it still contained residual milkstone remover \u2014 a typically acidic solution used to combat buildup in dairy equipment.But by 10:45 p.m., the Detectives Endowment Association was declaring that Finest had become \u201cill\u201d after being \u201cintentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack\u201d \u2014 as Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch made a show of visiting Bellevue while his union declared at 10:47 p.m. that police officers came \u201cunder attack\u201d from a \u201ctoxic substance, believed to be bleach.\u201dThe allegation was debunked only one day later when Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison posted, \u201cAfter a thorough investigation by the NYPD\u2019s Manhattan South investigators, it has been determined that there was no criminality by shake shack\u2019s employees.\u201dIt is worth noting that the \u201cshunned policeman\u201d is a known urban legend \u2014 a subtheme of the \u201cshunned serviceman\u201d folklore.

One related episode took place in the spring of 2018, when an initiative by the University of Texas (UT) prompted claims that \u201cliberals\u201d at that school were calling for masculinity to be designated as a mental illness. For example, the Constitution.com web site wrote: The insane, mentally deranged liberals at the University of Texas now want masculinity to be designated as a mental illness \u2026 [The] purported \u201ccounseling\u201d department at the university started a program to \u201chelp\u201d male students \u201ctake control over their gender identity and develop a healthy sense of masculinity \u2026\u201d The creators of this foolish left-wing circlejerk claim that it is that danged old \u201crestrictive masculinity\u201d that forces men to \u201cact like a man\u201d and that encourages men to be \u201ctoo masculine.\u201d This program wants people to stop saying men should be a \u201cbreadwinner\u201d or that they should strive for success in their careers. Men need to be wimpy, subservient, spineless, and unable to make a decision without a woman to tell them how to think and what to do. The conservative PJ Media web site similarly reported that the program amounted to \u201ctreating masculinity as if it were a mental health crisis,\u201d and the popular morning television show Fox & Friends claimed UT was \u201cnow treating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d: University of Texas to treat masculinity as a \u2018mental health\u2019 issue pic.twitter.com\/BtZdfclfMG \u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 29, 2018  In reality, nobody at the university\u2019s Counselling and Mental Health Center, liberal or otherwise, called for masculinity to be \u201cdesignated a mental illness\u201d or treated as a mental health issue. That characterization of the new program came from the Fox & Friends TV program and the PJ Media web site, not from those behind the initiative itself. The emphasis on \u201cmental health\u201d in all three reports appeared to stem from no more than the fact that it was the Counselling and Mental Health Center that was behind the program. In response to these misleading and sensationalist reports, the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT took the step of directly refuting the \u201cmental health issue\u201d claim in a statement posted on the school\u2019s web site: The MasculinUT program does not treat masculinity as a \u201cmental health issue,\u201d and any such statements are simply not accurate. It was established to bring more men to the table to address interpersonal violence, sexual assault and other issues. Like other UT programs related to sexual assault and interpersonal violence, MasculinUT is housed administratively in the university\u2019s Counseling and Mental Health Center. Its goals include helping men explore ways to reduce sexual violence, helping students take responsibility for their actions, and fostering healthier relationships on campus and beyond. Based on the promotional material and information on the MasculinUT web site, the closest the program\u2019s designers came to \u201ctreating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d was one section which listed \u201cemotional and mental health problems\u201d as one of four or five possible negative consequences of \u201cespousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity\u201d: Attending to masculinity can illuminate many important issues and take us a step closer to creating a dialogue for gender equity. Specifically for college students, research shows that espousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity results in men underperforming in college, participating in risky behavior that affects their health (such as binge drinking or drug use), and developing particular emotional and mental health problems that cannot be addressed unless we understand the specific vulnerabilities created by certain aspects of masculinity. The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine. This definition of masculinity also restricts what is acceptable in terms of appearance. This also makes it exclusionary, because a restrictive definition of masculinity depends on excluding people from that definition. Students who do not feel what a \u201creal man\u201d should feel, think the way a \u201creal man\u201d thinks, or looks the way a \u201creal man\u201d is supposed to look are vulnerable to violence from others who cannot accept male students who stray from this narrow definition. Students who feel targeted are also at risk of engaging in violent behavior in an attempt to not be the target of violence.

One related episode took place in the spring of 2018, when an initiative by the University of Texas (UT) prompted claims that \u201cliberals\u201d at that school were calling for masculinity to be designated as a mental illness. For example, the Constitution.com web site wrote: The insane, mentally deranged liberals at the University of Texas now want masculinity to be designated as a mental illness \u2026 [The] purported \u201ccounseling\u201d department at the university started a program to \u201chelp\u201d male students \u201ctake control over their gender identity and develop a healthy sense of masculinity \u2026\u201d The creators of this foolish left-wing circlejerk claim that it is that danged old \u201crestrictive masculinity\u201d that forces men to \u201cact like a man\u201d and that encourages men to be \u201ctoo masculine.\u201d This program wants people to stop saying men should be a \u201cbreadwinner\u201d or that they should strive for success in their careers. Men need to be wimpy, subservient, spineless, and unable to make a decision without a woman to tell them how to think and what to do. The conservative PJ Media web site similarly reported that the program amounted to \u201ctreating masculinity as if it were a mental health crisis,\u201d and the popular morning television show Fox & Friends claimed UT was \u201cnow treating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d: University of Texas to treat masculinity as a \u2018mental health\u2019 issue pic.twitter.com\/BtZdfclfMG \u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 29, 2018  In reality, nobody at the university\u2019s Counselling and Mental Health Center, liberal or otherwise, called for masculinity to be \u201cdesignated a mental illness\u201d or treated as a mental health issue. That characterization of the new program came from the Fox & Friends TV program and the PJ Media web site, not from those behind the initiative itself. The emphasis on \u201cmental health\u201d in all three reports appeared to stem from no more than the fact that it was the Counselling and Mental Health Center that was behind the program. In response to these misleading and sensationalist reports, the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT took the step of directly refuting the \u201cmental health issue\u201d claim in a statement posted on the school\u2019s web site: The MasculinUT program does not treat masculinity as a \u201cmental health issue,\u201d and any such statements are simply not accurate. It was established to bring more men to the table to address interpersonal violence, sexual assault and other issues. Like other UT programs related to sexual assault and interpersonal violence, MasculinUT is housed administratively in the university\u2019s Counseling and Mental Health Center. Its goals include helping men explore ways to reduce sexual violence, helping students take responsibility for their actions, and fostering healthier relationships on campus and beyond. Based on the promotional material and information on the MasculinUT web site, the closest the program\u2019s designers came to \u201ctreating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d was one section which listed \u201cemotional and mental health problems\u201d as one of four or five possible negative consequences of \u201cespousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity\u201d: Attending to masculinity can illuminate many important issues and take us a step closer to creating a dialogue for gender equity. Specifically for college students, research shows that espousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity results in men underperforming in college, participating in risky behavior that affects their health (such as binge drinking or drug use), and developing particular emotional and mental health problems that cannot be addressed unless we understand the specific vulnerabilities created by certain aspects of masculinity. The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine. This definition of masculinity also restricts what is acceptable in terms of appearance. This also makes it exclusionary, because a restrictive definition of masculinity depends on excluding people from that definition. Students who do not feel what a \u201creal man\u201d should feel, think the way a \u201creal man\u201d thinks, or looks the way a \u201creal man\u201d is supposed to look are vulnerable to violence from others who cannot accept male students who stray from this narrow definition. Students who feel targeted are also at risk of engaging in violent behavior in an attempt to not be the target of violence. Restricting the definition of masculinity can turn students into \u201cpressure cookers,\u201d where if a student is not allowed to express all of their emotions and thoughts, these just build up and can explode in various, unhealthy ways (such as violent behavior or coping mechanisms such as drinking). Since 2015, MasculinUT has been run by Voices Against Violence, an initiative overseen by the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT, which produces programming to prevent and respond to interpersonal violence, including sexual assault.

The evidence clearly indicates that the University of Texas' Counselling and Mental Health Center, through their MasculinUT program, did not treat or label masculinity as a mental health issue. Instead, the program was aimed at addressing issues like sexual assault and interpersonal violence by encouraging a healthier sense of masculinity. Misinterpretations and sensationalist reporting by certain media outlets contributed to the spread of this inaccurate claim.

Although this sartorial fad is overwhelmingly favored by young males, it is not limited to them \u2014 young women have at times likewise indulged in the urge to sag. The practice, which did begin in prisons, worked its way from the hoosegow into hip hop culture. It was adopted by a variety of rap artists, such as Ice-T and Too Short, which enhanced its perceived tough-guy cachet. Sagging can even be taken a step further by wearing the droopy breeches backwards. (Totally Krossed Out, the 1992 debut album of Kriss Kross, shows the pair of 13-year-old rappers doing this.) By 1995 the style had seeped into mainstream teen culture \u2014 one no longer needed to be a wannabe \u201cgangsta\u201d to sling \u2019em low.

In a piece for the Huffington Post, Jana Schmiedling of the \u201cWoman of Size\u201d podcast says that she mostly enjoyed her experience at the theme park until a dark cloud descended upon her day when she attempted to participate in the \u201cHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey\u201d ride. The story is based on a 9 May 2018\u00a0opinion piece written by Schmiedling about her experience while visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Hollywood, a movie-themed amusement park in Los Angeles. She recounts getting kicked off the \u201cHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey\u201d ride due to her size after making it as far as sitting down and lowering the shoulder harness: One of the 20-something ride managers walked over and asked us all to step off because of a \u201csafety\u201d issue.

The predicament is usually compounded by the mortification resulting from having it happen in full view of other park guests. Schmiedling argues that the experience is emblematic of the ways in which some are bullied or excluded because they don\u2019t conform to socially-dictated weight norms and that theme parks, places where people spend a great deal of money to escape their day-to-day struggles and conflicts, should build attractions that accommodate guests of all sizes and body types\u00a0\u2014 a seemingly innocuous, if not benevolent, suggestion.

[\u2026] Are the seats more snug to better hold the guests in, or is it used as a built-in weight limit? The ride doesn\u2019t have any inversions like the roller coasters mentioned do, but it also doesn\u2019t have the forward momentum to hold guests in their seats either. Maybe since the ride is still in technical rehearsals, the seats will be adjusted to allow larger guests, but there\u2019s no indication that is the case.

There\u2019s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms\u00a0but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate. However, PolitiFact found no basis for Richardson\u2019s claim that North Carolina rivers rank among the top five most polluted in the United States.\"","fact_checkers":"Paul Specht","premise":"\"It\u2019s one thing to say a couple of North Carolina\u2019s rivers \u2014 the Neuse and the Cape Fear \u2014 are in danger of becoming very polluted. A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It\u2019s another thing to say what state Rep. William \"\"Billy\"\" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says.

PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted.

A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It\u2019s another thing to say what state Rep. William \"\"Billy\"\" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically \"\"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded.

{"claim_id":31810,"hypothesis":"Cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien, not human, origin.","date_published":"January 13, 2017","explanation_1":"We found no credible academic sources or publications corroborating the claim that DNA taken from the skulls found at Paracas was not human in origin or abnormal enough to warrant further study. The practice of purposely elongating skulls is well known to anthropologists, and while academics may debate the motivation certain societies had for doing it, there is no scientific debate over whether\u00a0those societies were human.","fact_checkers":"Bethania Palma","premise":"A story has been circulating around alien and UFO conspiracy web sites since 2014, alluding that DNA tests done on cone-shaped skulls found in the Paracas region of Peru show they are of extraterrestrial origin. The strange appearance of the skulls coupled with the outlandish claim continues to give the story legs, and it continues to make the rounds as of mid-January 2017: The director of the Paracas Museum of History sent five samples of the Paracas skulls to undergo genetic testing, and the results were mesmerizing. The samples which consisted of hair, skin teeth and some fragments of cranial bones gave incredible details that have fueled the mystery surrounding these anomalous skulls. The genetic laboratory to where the samples were sent was not informed of the origin of the skulls in order to avoid \u2018influenced results.\u2019 Interestingly, the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, showed mutations that were unknown to any man, primate or animal found on planet Earth. The mutations present in the samples of the Paracas skulls suggest that researchers were dealing with a completely new \u2018human-like being,\u2019 very different from Homo sapiens, Neanderthals or Denisovans. The announcement in 2014 that the skulls had non-human DNA was originally promoted by Brien Foerster, a figure known for pseudoscience. As RationalWiki notes: Foerster has little in the way of relevant scientific qualifications but runs a tour company and was a regular on the very unscientific History Channel show Ancient Aliens, the museum is a private company owned by a man with no scientific qualifications, not an academic institution, and the results were announced not in a peer reviewed journal but on Facebook. Suspiciously, the geneticist who supposedly conducted the tests refused to own up and his or her identity was kept secret by Foerster. The elongated shape of the skulls is most likely due to a practice known to anthropologists called \u201cartificial cranial deformation.\u201d \u00a0This has been practiced in a\u00a0number of cultures from a wide variety of geographies, going back millennia: Experts speculate that the widespread tradition could stem from a host of motivations, not the least beauty. The latest hypothesis to join the list, however, is the belief that skull shaping could have been a boon for survival to some who practiced it, as proposed by Marta Alfonso-Durruty, an anthropologist at Kansas State University, and colleagues in a new research paper published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women. This is not the first time a discovery of human remains with elongated skulls sparked the hopes of UFO enthusiasts. A 2015 discovery of a prehistoric woman in Russia, at a site known as Arkaim or \u201cRussia\u2019s Stonehenge,\u201d with a similar deformity also created a buzz: Some believe that the skull\u2019s high forehead is characteristic of the so-called \u201calien grey\u201d often depicted as large-eyed and large-foreheaded beings in sci-fi films and even hoaxes. Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to. While both English and Spanish-language web sites have published pages of credulous stories about Foerster\u2019s \u00a0\u201cdiscovery,\u201d the Spanish-language skeptics blog Marcianitas Verdes notes: The Paracas culture was one of the ancient Andean villages that practiced skeletal modification. They wrapped\u00a0their babies\u2019 heads with rope, cloths and wooden boards in order to lengthen their skulls. This was done for spiritual or religious reasons, and scholars believe that it was an effort to look more like their deities. The web site delves into what may have caused the vague genetic abnormality supposedly found by Foerster\u2019s investigation: At best it is not conclusive. DNA was identified as human, but with abnormalities; Anomalies that could be caused by any number of contaminants or defects in the process. It could be that this DNA actually provides unusual results, but the only thing that can be said about it at this point is that it requires more study. The sensational launch of unconfirmed and unverifiable information like this on a radio show is not worthy of the attention this story is receiving.","sources":" ","label":2,"subjects":"Viral Phenomena, aliens, brian foerster, rationalwiki","__index_level_0__":9420,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nA story has been circulating around alien and UFO conspiracy web sites since 2014, alluding that DNA tests done on cone-shaped skulls found in the Paracas region of Peru show they are of extraterrestrial origin.

As RationalWiki notes: Foerster has little in the way of relevant scientific qualifications but runs a tour company and was a regular on the very unscientific History Channel show Ancient Aliens, the museum is a private company owned by a man with no scientific qualifications, not an academic institution, and the results were announced not in a peer reviewed journal but on Facebook. Suspiciously, the geneticist who supposedly conducted the tests refused to own up and his or her identity was kept secret by Foerster. The elongated shape of the skulls is most likely due to a practice known to anthropologists called \u201cartificial cranial deformation.\u201d \u00a0This has been practiced in a\u00a0number of cultures from a wide variety of geographies, going back millennia: Experts speculate that the widespread tradition could stem from a host of motivations, not the least beauty. The latest hypothesis to join the list, however, is the belief that skull shaping could have been a boon for survival to some who practiced it, as proposed by Marta Alfonso-Durruty, an anthropologist at Kansas State University, and colleagues in a new research paper published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women. This is not the first time a discovery of human remains with elongated skulls sparked the hopes of UFO enthusiasts. A 2015 discovery of a prehistoric woman in Russia, at a site known as Arkaim or \u201cRussia\u2019s Stonehenge,\u201d with a similar deformity also created a buzz: Some believe that the skull\u2019s high forehead is characteristic of the so-called \u201calien grey\u201d often depicted as large-eyed and large-foreheaded beings in sci-fi films and even hoaxes. Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to. While both English and Spanish-language web sites have published pages of credulous stories about Foerster\u2019s \u00a0\u201cdiscovery,\u201d the Spanish-language skeptics blog Marcianitas Verdes notes: The Paracas culture was one of the ancient Andean villages that practiced skeletal modification. They wrapped\u00a0their babies\u2019 heads with rope, cloths and wooden boards in order to lengthen their skulls. This was done for spiritual or religious reasons, and scholars believe that it was an effort to look more like their deities. The web site delves into what may have caused the vague genetic abnormality supposedly found by Foerster\u2019s investigation: At best it is not conclusive. DNA was identified as human, but with abnormalities; Anomalies that could be caused by any number of contaminants or defects in the process. It could be that this DNA actually provides unusual results, but the only thing that can be said about it at this point is that it requires more study. The sensational launch of unconfirmed and unverifiable information like this on a radio show is not worthy of the attention this story is receiving.n\nClaim: Cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien, not human, origin.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that the cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien origin is false based on extensive evidence provided. The skulls are most likely the result of artificial cranial deformation, a practice well-documented among various cultures globally, including the Paracas culture of ancient Peru. This practice involved binding the heads of infants with ropes, cloths, and wooden boards to elongate the skull for spiritual, religious, or cultural reasons, possibly to resemble deities or promote group cohesion. The DNA anomalies cited in non-peer-reviewed claims were likely due to contaminants or errors in the genetic testing process. The lack of credible scientific backing and reliance on sources known for pseudoscience further undermines the claim of extraterrestrial origin."}

At the outset of his remarks, Johnston referred to abortion as \"\"the most common surgery in our country.\"\" The statement became the launching point for the Zanesville-area doctor to make his case that abortions have become too routine and for why Ohioans should back a rewriting of the Ohio Constitution so that a fertilized egg is defined as a person -- a change that effectively would outlaw abortion. Johnston\u2019s claim seemed like the kind of straightforward assertion that Politifact Ohio can dig into while steering clear of the moral questions that surround the divisive issue. We began by checking with Johnston to see where he got his numbers on abortion, and the frequency of other procedures. He directed us to the website for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, as the source for his abortion numbers\u2014they count about 1.21 million abortions in 2008. He also pointed us to several websites for gall bladder surgery, which assert that the procedure is one of the most common surgeries in the United States with about 500,000 patients a year. The Guttmacher Institute numbers for abortions were much higher than those we found from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reported about 828,000 abortions in 2007. However, the CDC numbers are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions done in California, Maryland and New Hampshire \u2014 three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary. Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman with the Guttmacher Institute, said her group\u2019s numbers include all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports. Over the past several years, the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s estimated number of abortions in the United States have basically held steady going from 1,206,200 in 2005 to 1,212,350 in 2008. But are there more common forms of surgery? The federal CDC keeps close tabs on what people are discharged from hospitals for based on a pair of national annual surveys, one for inpatient and one for outpatient clients. By far, the most common form of surgery in 2006 was eye surgery for cataracts. There were about 5.63 million eye surgeries that involved either removing or replacing the eye lens, according to the 2006 National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (the latest outpatient survey available). There were about 1.4 million endoscopic polypectomies, which involves the removal of presumed pre-cancerous lesions such as polyps on the colon, according to the outpatient numbers. Meanwhile, there were about 1.34 million Caesarean sections where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman\u2019s abdomen, according to the 2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey (the latest inpatient survey available). Abortion would rank fourth behind that trio in most common surgeries. But are they all examples of surgery or could they be considered just medical procedures? We spoke with Dr. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, and she said that while the term surgery isn\u2019t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered \"\"surgery.\"\" Keder said that eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries. Additionally, we should note here that because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures -- almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 in the United States -- that virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was much more common than abortions. There were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list.

Widely considered to be the first major overhaul of the agency's food safety provisions since 1938, the Food Safety Modernization Act tightens safety rules and boosts Food and Drug Administration inspections at an estimated price of $1.4 billion over the next five years. That's way too high a price, some say. The nation's food is just fine to eat, said Republican U.S. House Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah. \"\"We still have a food supply that's 99.99 percent safe,\"\" Kingston told The Washington Post. \"\"No one wants anybody to get sick, and we should always strive to make sure food is safe. But the case for a $1.4 billion expenditure isn't there.\"\" Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford repeated the claim in a Jan. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The food supply is 99.99 percent safe? That sounds great, but is it true? Kingston has a big say in whether food safety legislation gets funded. He is chairman of the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that holds the FDA's purse strings. \"\"I would not identify it [funding] as something that will necessarily be zeroed out, but it is quite possible it will be scaled back if it is significant overreach,\"\" Kingston told The Post. Crawford told us this is how Kingston and his staff determined the food supply is almost completely safe:  They took the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's latest estimate for the number of food-borne illnesses each year and divided it by the number of times people in the U.S. eat each year. The CDC said that in 2011, just under 48 million people will contract a food-borne illness. There are about 310 million people in the U.S. If they eat three times a day, that's 339.45 billion meals. And 48 million is roughly 0.01 percent of that. So Kingston's math is accurate. But does that mean his overall point is correct? We found Kingston was comparing apples to oranges. He used CDC data that measured a person's risk of getting ill to measure the risk of the food safety supply. But those are not the same thing. The CDC's figure came out as part of an announcement that one out of six people in the U.S. will contract a food-borne illness in the coming year. In other words, about 16.66 percent of the population will have problems this year ranging from a bad stomachache to deadly kidney failure because of dangerous pathogens in their food. We talked to Elaine Scallan, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Public Health who formerly worked for the CDC. She did research on which the CDC results are based. Kingston's calculation measured the risk that your next meal will make you sick. But it is \"\"definitely not a good indicator of the safety of our food supply,\"\" Scallan said. Each time you eat a meal, you take that same risk again. Over time, that risk adds up, Scallan said. Robert Scharff, a professor at Ohio State University and a former economist with the Food and Drug Administration, calculated that food-borne illness costs the U.S. $152 billion annually. His report described food-borne illness as \"\"a large problem that deserves the attention of policymakers.\"\" He also noted in an e-mail interview with AJC PolitiFact Georgia that Kingston's approach only covered the risk of eating a single meal. Other criticism was more blunt. Barbara Kowalcyk, director of food safety for the Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention, expressed similar concerns and said Kingston's measure \"\"just doesn't make sense.\"\" New York University professor Marion Nestle, a well-regarded food safety and nutrition expert, had similar concerns. \"\"Isn\u2019t 48 million people getting sick or dying unnecessarily worth doing something about? I think so,\"\" Nestle said. So experts think Kingston's method has a crucial, if not fatal, flaw. But we decided to dig deeper. We looked at a sampling of food safety tests to see whether their results resembled Kingston's. A recently completed nationwide survey on young chickens by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service found some 7.5 percent tested positive for salmonella and 46.7 percent for campylobacter, which the CDC describes as \"\"one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in the United States.\"\" The federal government also looked at fruits and vegetables at processing plants in 2008 and found that while 5 percent had e. coli bacterial levels that suggested they came into contact with unclean water, only 0.3 percent of samples tested positive for the form that can make you sick. It reported 16 of nearly 11,700 samples tested positive for salmonella. Consumer Reports magazine tested for salmonella and campylobacter in chicken it bought from grocery stores. Its results, published in the January 2010 issue, were that campylobacter was present in 62 percent and salmonella was in 14 percent. Both were present in 9 percent. The magazine's publisher, the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Consumers Union, backed the food safety bill. To sum up:  Kingston's calculation mixed up its apples and oranges. He said his calculation showed that the food supply is \"\"99.99 percent safe.\"\" But his numbers described something very different: the risk that your next meal will make you sick.

The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick.\"\" We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin. The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. \"\"Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,\"\" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. \"\"The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well. The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings.\"\" We wanted to consult an independent scientist, though, so we turned to Dr. Tony Overfelt of Auburn University. Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze \"\"might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.\"\" \"\"Quite a bit of research indicates that,\"\" he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: \u2022 A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to \"\"a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis.\"\" \u2022 A 2003 study in the  New England Journal of Medicine  on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were \"\"clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft.\"\" \u2022 A 2005 study in  The Lancet  concluded, \"\"The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.\"\" That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 rubbing your eyes. \"\"If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go. I wouldn't hesitate at all to get on an airplane.\"\" If Biden had said people should be careful about touching contaminated surfaces, that would have been one thing. But his statement was \"\"When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.\"\" That's just wrong.

For more information on that ruling, and how it relates to glyphosate residue in food, please read our August 2018\u00a0explainer on that case. On 15 November 2016, the natural food evangelist and alternative health guru known as the Food Babe posted a report from a natural food activist group named Food Democracy Now that alleged to demonstrate common American foods contain high levels of glyphosate, a chemical in Monsanto\u2019s RoundUp herbicide and the most prevalent weed-killer on the planet. Her post and the report it highlights are a new addition to the contentious political debate about the chemical\u2019s harm to humans and the environment, as well as the potential influence of large companies like Monsanto on regulatory agencies, that has been ongoing for decades. Glyphosate is widely applied to crops around the world \u2014 especially genetically modified crops specifically bred to be resistant to the chemical, per the National Pesticide Information Center: Glyphosate is an herbicide. It is applied to the leaves of plants to kill both broadleaf plants and grasses. The sodium salt form of glyphosate is used to regulate plant growth and ripen fruit. Glyphosate was first registered for use in the U.S. in 1974. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States. People apply it in agriculture and forestry, on lawns and gardens, and for weeds in industrial areas. Some products containing glyphosate control aquatic plants. Regulatory agencies have gone back and forth on its safety ever since it was registered for use. The idea, which has been verified by\u00a0observations, is that glyphosate runs off into the water supply, where it can be ingested directly, or consumed after it leaves a residue on food. The first assessment of glyphosate\u2019s carcinogenic potential was undertaken by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1985. Based on studies done primarily with rodents, they classified the chemical as \u201ca Group C (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with limited animal evidence and little or no human data) carcinogen\u201d in 1986. After a series of additional investigations, which included industry sponsored studies, the EPA reclassified the chemical in 1993 as \u201cGroup E carcinogen (signifies evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans).\u201d A majority of the data used to demonstrate evidence of harm comes from studies in which environmentally unrealistic concentrations of glyphosate were exposed to rats, mice, and fish. Some recent studies have demonstrated potentially\u00a0adverse effects at low exposure levels but the validity of these results have been called into question by other researchers. Although a March 2015 review by the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer suggested glyphosate may have some carcinogenic potential, the current consensus amongst the world\u2019s regulatory agencies is that it is safe for consumption and non-carcinogenic at environmentally relevant levels, with the WHO concluding: Glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet. Still, a 2014 report from the US Government Accountability Office compelled the FDA to set up an initiative to monitor food for glyphosate residue, a decision met by praise by environmentalists and food activists. As reported by the Huffington Post\u2019s Carey Gillam, however, the effort was halted due to a lack of agreement on standardizing the analyses: The FDA\u2019s residue testing for glyphosate was combined with a broader herbicides analysis program the FDA set in motion in February of this year. But the glyphosate testing has been particularly challenging for the FDA. The agency was finally forced to put the glyphosate residue testing part of the work plan on hold amid confusion, disagreement and difficulties with establishing a standard methodology to use across the agency\u2019s multiple U.S. laboratories, according to FDA sources. Equipment issues have also been a problem, with some labs citing a need for more sensitive instruments, sources within FDA said. This is where the Food Babe\u2019s unsubstantiated narrative comes into the picture. Based primarily on the fact that the FDA canceled its residue testing program, along with results from various studies performed on animals, she alleges a nefarious connection between the FDA and Monsanto, the developer of the RoundUp: When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn\u2019t like the results they started getting \u2013 especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye. While there are conflicts of interest arguments to be made about the use of industry sponsored studies or petitions to influence regulators, there is no evidence to suggest the FDA halted its testing program in response to pressure from Monsanto. Instead of providing evidence of the alleged connection, the Food Babe presented the results of non-peer reviewed lab tests performed on various food items at the behest of the activist group Food Democracy Now and the research platform The Detox Project, alleging it exposed high levels of the herbicide on common foods: A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto\u2019s Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts. Just to give you an idea of how outrageous these amounts are, independent research shows that probable harm to human health begins at really low levels of exposure \u2013 at only 0.1 ppb of glyphosate. Many foods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulators throughout the world consider \u201csafe\u201d. The statement about 0.1 ppb being the lower limit for harm to human health is controversial, as only one of the studies listed as providing support for that claim actually tested an amount that low; the test was performed on mice, not humans, and it used the word \u201cpotential\u201d, not \u201cprobable\u201d. It is also important to note that many of the results they reported are actually marked with the note that they\u00a0\u201cmay not represent an accurate representation of the sample.\u201d The lab\u00a0results commissioned by Food Democracy Now claimed to show residue values on common American foods that were well above 0.1 ppb; but the methods employed are not elucidated, and its important to remember that the FDA limit is four orders of magnitude greater than the threshold they claim. A final point to note is that the report was commissioned by two groups with a stated agenda, as declared in its introduction: The testing and analysis was performed at the request of FOOD DEMOCRACY NOW!, in coordination with THE DETOX PROJECT, which gathered additional scientific evidence from around the world and included a compendium of independent research on glyphosate.

We aim to study all of the most common man-made chemicals in our environment over the next few years [\u2026] to protect women and children from the harmful effects of man-made chemicals in our food and in our environment. There is no evidence to suggest the FDA shut down its residue program due to complaints from Monsanto.

The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place.

It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family\u2019s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before.

No, we\u2019re not talking about Flint, Mich. This concerns the southeast Asian city of Manila, the capital and\u00a0biggest city in the Philippines. In 1997, officials in the Pacific island nation set up not one but two private companies to deliver water to homes and businesses. One of those companies has been a financial success. So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation\u2019s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. \"\"In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent,\"\" Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose\u00a0by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore\u2019s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging. The soundest data we could find was in a 2013 report from local regulators, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took\u00a0place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate  (pesos\/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a  typical bill Typical household bill  (1997 pesos) 121 295 537  As you\u2019ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila\u2019s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization \"\"was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s.\"\" The IFC\u2019s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"\" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. \"\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\"\" Jones said. \"\"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"\" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. \"\"If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it\u2019s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,\"\" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before. Our ruling Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012.

As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"\" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. \"\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\"\" Jones said. \"\"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"\" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water. But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. \"\"If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it\u2019s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,\"\" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before. Our ruling Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family\u2019s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before. Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFC\u2019s equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start.n\nClaim: \"Water rates in Manila, Philippines, \"\"were raised up to 845 percent\"\" when a subsidiary of the World Bank became a partial owner.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that water rates in Manila were raised up to 845 percent when a subsidiary of the World Bank became a partial owner is partially true and false. The rates did increase significantly after the privatization, which involved the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank. However, the 845 percent increase applies to the period from 1997 to 2012, not specifically from 2004 (when the IFC became a part-owner) to 2012. From 2004 to 2012, the rates increased by about 170 percent. Therefore, while the rates did indeed rise significantly, the specific figure cited is incorrect for the period after the IFC's involvement began. Moreover, the IFC was involved in crafting the privatization plan from the start, indicating a broader influence on the water rate increases."}

On the safety record for nicotine gum all we got in this story was one health behavior specialist saying, \u201cThere really doesn\u2019t appear to be any great harm.\u201d And a British regulatory proclamation that \u201cthere are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects.\u201d\u00a0 Statements like \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to be\u201d and \u201cno grounds to suspect\u201d could be haunting some day.

We also wish it had presented a more balanced perspective from the sources quoted. The two nicotine replacement users are probably not examples of how nicotine products are used widely. The use of nicotine replacement at high dose for 15 years is well outside any regulatory boundaries anywhere. As the story points out, \u201cAbout one in five American adults smokes\u2014a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004.\u201d As other studies have found, about 1 out of every 5 preventable deaths is also due to smoking. This is a massive public health challenge. People take up smoking and continue to do so despite the known risks for a variety of reasons. Just about 50% of smokers attempt to quit each year. Most fail. A major reason for the failure is the addictive power of nicotine. A story that highlights the public and personal health issues associated with smoking and smoking cessation is always welcome.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"The story did not discuss costs, and this was a missed opportunity.

The two anecdotes provided strongly suggest that continuing an ongoing use of nicotine replacement for years is both acceptable and safe. The story does not engage in disease-mongering.

One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves. The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study\u2019s findings\u00a0(such as the\u00a0researchers\u2019 conclusions that\u00a0the results are of \u201cuncertain clinical importance\u201d).

And, because\u00a0the story\u2019s only interviewed\u00a0source has\u00a0potential conflicts of interest,\u00a0independent scrutiny was needed. Urinary incontinence is common, affecting millions of individuals, both women and men. The prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal result of aging. The condition is more prevalent in women, though beyond the age of 80, both men and women reportedly have similar rates. The kind of incontinence studied here\u2013\u201csevere refractory urge incontinence\u201d\u2013specifically means a person has an abnormally frequent urge to urinate, and it is\u00a0resistant to standard treatments.","fact_checkers":"Dave Mosher,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Joy Victory","premise":"We hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day. This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life. The closing line of the study brings this into question, i.e. how the work is of \u201cuncertain clinical importance,\u201d and good interview questions with both a study author and independent expert source could have greatly clarified the issue. Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com. And what of the harms of a neurostimulator implant? There\u2019s no mention of this, and the side effects are numerous. The story does a decent job of explaining that the study, stating it was \u201ca head to head comparison of a single Botox injection to the implanted medical device, assigning 381 women to randomly get one or the other treatment. The women were asked to keep diaries for six months.\u201d We\u2019re also told that the women had to have about 6 accidents over three days to be included in the study, and that other more standard treatments didn\u2019t help. The headline is also accurate, in terms of what the study found, and it doesn\u2019t overplay the results. In looking at the study, however, we\u2019ll note how we were struck by two things. First, the patients\u2019 reported impression of improvement in bladder leakage and function failed to pass a test of statistical significance, which undermines the story\u2019s claim that \u201cboth groups of women reported equal satisfaction.\u201d Second, the closing lines of the study point out how the treatment \u201cresulted in a small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain clinical importance.\u201d\u00a0This should have been explained to readers, along with details on what this means when researchers draw this conclusion. We don\u2019t see any language that would unnecessarily frighten a reader. The condition is real, uncomfortable, and carries\u00a0significant impact on people\u2019s daily lives. We didn\u2019t see\u00a0any backstopping of this study by an outside source. Although nonprofit websites are quoted, that material is used for purposes of background \u2014 not to assess the study\u2019s claims. Another significant oversight here is no mention of co-authors\u2019 financial relationships with the products used in both arms of the trial. (We give props to a Duke University press release about the study for pointing this out.) A quick Google search of the lead author\u2019s name and the term Medtronic reveals that she has been a consultant for the neurostimulator devicemaker, as well as for Allergan, Botox\u2019s manufacturer. We not only see a comparison to the medical device that the study focused on, but also methods that require no overt treatment, \u201csuch as weight loss, drinking less caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding lifting heavy objects.\u201d The story also notes that \u201c[e]xercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can help, as can \u2018bladder training\u2019 to accustom the body to urinating at regular times.\u201d The story could have been more clear that these treatments aren\u2019t likely to work for the women in this study who had a specific type of severe urge incontinence that is usually not responsive to exercise and other less invasive measures. Both of these treatments are widely available. But,\u00a0a description of the procedures themselves would have been helpful (they are both quite invasive and require seeing providers with special training). While \u2018regular\u2019 Botox cosmetic treatments can be easily given by various medical professionals, without specialized training, in the office, this may not be the case for Botox injections into the bladder. The story didn\u2019t establish what\u2019s novel about this study. As the news release states, the study was \u201cthe first randomized trial comparing the efficacy of two FDA-approved, third-line therapies in a severely affected population.\u201d We didn\u2019t catch any overtly copy\/pasted quotes or language that made its way into the story from the\u00a0Duke University news release.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Botox,urinary incontinence","__index_level_0__":9684,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nWe hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day. This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life.

The study indicates that Botox and the nerve stimulator both reduced the number of 'accidents' significantly, suggesting effectiveness in treating incontinence. However, the Botox treatment resulted in urinary tract infections being three times more common compared to the nerve stimulator, indicating a difference in side effect profiles which affects the overall assessment of 'working as well.' Additionally, the study highlighted that while there was a reduction in the number of incontinence episodes, this was of 'uncertain clinical importance,' questioning the significance of the improvement. Hence, while both treatments were effective to some extent, their equivalency in efficacy and safety is not conclusively supported, making the claim only partially true."}
{"claim_id":24581,"hypothesis":"As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance.","date_published":"August 20, 2009","explanation_1":"Pascrell says up to 22,000 Americans die yearly because they don\u2019t have health insurance","fact_checkers":"Louis Jacobson","premise":"\"On July 30, 2009, PolitiFact rated as True a statement by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey that \"\"as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance.\"\" We based that ruling on the same study that Pascrell did. Subsequently, a reader pointed out a paper published last spring in the online edition of the journal HSR: Health Services Research that contradicts the study Pascrell relied on. So we are changing our rating to  and providing this new analysis. Much of the push for reforming the nation's health care system has been driven by concerns about uninsured Americans. So it's no surprise that a statistic on the number of Americans who die every year due to lack of health insurance has been used frequently in speeches and opinion columns. However, this statistic, which stems from a report by an influential, quasi-governmental institution, is quietly coming under academic attack. When Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said on July 30 that \"\"as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance,\"\" the number he cited was an updated version of one originally calculated by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine. In 2002, an IOM panel of more than a dozen medical specialists estimated that 18,000 Americans died in 2000 because they were uninsured. They came up with this figure by looking at long-term studies that measured the links between insurance status and death rates. The IOM then used annual statistics on insurance rates and deaths to determine an estimate of extra deaths attributable to the lack of insurance. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM's study with newer data. Replicating the Institute of Medicine's methodology, Dorn concluded that the 18,000 figure should be increased to 22,000 \u2014 the figure later cited by Pascrell. Given the Institute of Medicine's prestige and Pascrell's caution in saying that \"\"as many as\"\" 22,000 Americans die annually from a lack of insurance, which signaled some uncertainty about the exact number, we gave the congressman a True rating. But a more recent paper raises questions about the IOM's conclusions. The paper, published online in April in HSR: Health Services Research, is by Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine. Using data on adult health and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is a part of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kronick concludes that the Institute of Medicine's estimate (or any that replicates its methodology, such as Dorn's) is \"\"almost certainly incorrect.\"\" Pascrell's office was not aware of the paper when he made his statement and we did not find it when we researched his claim. The most notable difference between the Institute of Medicine's data \u2014 which were drawn from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey as well as the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey \u2014 is that Kronick adjusted it for a number of demographic and health factors, such as status as a smoker and body mass index. When he did that, \"\"the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance.\"\" In other words, once you compare death rates in an apples-to-apples fashion \u2014 comparing insured smokers to uninsured smokers, for instance \u2014 the likelihood of dying evens out. This, in turn, would mean that IOM's estimate of 18,000 deaths would drop essentially to zero. In his paper, Kronick acknowledges that this is a \"\"counterintuitive\"\" result, possibly resulting from the safety net of public hospitals and community clinics providing \"\"'good enough' access to care for the uninsured to keep their mortality rate similar to that of the insured.\"\" Either way, he writes, \"\"there would not be much change in the number of deaths in the United States as a result of universal coverage, although the difficulties of inferring causality from observational analyses temper the strength of this conclusion.\"\" We ran Kronick's paper by a number of health care policy experts to see whether they thought it undercut the Institute of Medicine's death estimate. Everyone agreed that both Kronick personally and the journal that published him are credible. Because the significance of his finding could also have political consequences \u2014 on June 24, for instance, John Goodman, president of the conservative National Center for Policy Analysis, testified to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health that we \"\"do not know how much morbidity and mortality is attributable to lack of health insurance\"\" \u2014 we also wanted to determine whether there may be any ideological bias at work. But we found no evidence of it. In fact, far from having ties to the conservative movement, Kronick served as a senior health care policy adviser in the Clinton administration, where, according to his biography, he contributed to the development of the Clinton health care reform proposal. Kronick's articles have appeared in the  New England Journal of Medicine  and the  Journal of the American Medical Association  , and his work has at times been funded by the Commonwealth Fund, whose mission is \"\"to promote a high-performing health care system\"\" that aids \"\"society's most vulnerable,\"\" including \"\"the uninsured.\"\" Kronick even told PolitiFact that his finding was \"\"not the answer I wanted\"\" and, as a result, he agonized over whether to publish it or not. He said he's \"\"grateful\"\" that it has so far been unnoticed in the increasingly hostile debate over health care. \"\"I don't have a whole lot of friends, and will probably lose a few over this,\"\" he told us. \"\"And I might make some friends I didn't want.\"\" But a number of experts we spoke to are glad that Kronick did publish it. Henry Aaron, a health policy specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that he was impressed by Kronick's research from the time Kronick presented an early draft of it at a Brookings lunch seminar. \"\"I found his reasoning compelling,\"\" said Aaron, himself a member of the Institute of Medicine. \"\"In fact, after listening to his presentation, I had a hard time believing that the IOM had done what they had done.\"\" In interviews, Aaron and other health care scholars agreed with Kronick that uninsured and insured Americans differ in many ways other than their insurance status. \"\"To estimate the impact of the lack of insurance on mortality rates, one has to control statistically for all of those differences,\"\" Aaron said. That, he added, is exactly what Kronick has sought to do so. Robert Book, a senior research fellow in health economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, agrees with Aaron. \"\"I would be more inclined to believe Kronick's than other studies,\"\" he said, \"\"I'm just surprised the IOM did their study without controlling for other factors.\"\" Book also praised Kronick\u2019s decision to run calculations with numerous alternative models, and to remove various factors, one at a time, from the calculations. \"\"From the standpoint of a careful econometric study, Kronick\u2019s paper is excellent,\"\" Book said. \"\"I\u2019ve seen few papers that are this thorough in terms of seeking alternate explanations for their conclusions.\"\" Other health policy specialists we talked to were open to the idea of Kronick being right, while urging caution before overruling the Institute of Medicine estimate. Dorn, the Urban Institute researcher, pointed to a second study published by the Institute of Medicine on Feb. 24, 2009. This 268-page volume, America's Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care, provides a detailed analysis of subsequent studies on the topic. While it didn\u2019t provide a new estimate of extra deaths from uninsurance, the new Institute of Medicine study concluded that \"\"the body of evidence on the health consequences of health insurance is stronger than ever before.\"\" Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund and an Institute of Medicine member, said that the existence of Kronick's study \"\"doesn't convince me yet not to use the IOM study,\"\" but she added that \"\"if I saw a few more, I might be convinced. I tend to believe things when I see multiple studies using different databases and methodologies come to the same conclusion.\"\" (Aaron said he agreed with Davis on this point.) For the record, an IOM spokeswoman said the institute has not assessed Kronick's paper and thus had no comment on its assertions. On one key point, the Institute of Medicine and Kronick actually aren't that far apart. Kronick said he doesn't doubt that individuals' health suffers when they're uninsured \u2014 he just hasn't found evidence that they die sooner. \"\"No one would choose not to have insurance if they could afford it,\"\" Kronick said. \"\"There's no benefit to having 47 million Americans uninsured.\"\" When we asked Pascrell\u2019s office whether the Kronick study would change their view, spokesman Paul Brubaker said it would not. \"\"The point of the congressman\u2019s statistic is to show a direct correlation between one\u2019s ability to pay and the ability to have insurance, and therefore on their ability to be healthy,\u201d Brubaker said. But for us, Kronick\u2019s study raises questions about the reliability of the Institute of Medicine\u2019s death estimate. We acknowledge that there is not yet a consensus among the experts. But in re-evaluating Pascrell's claim, we can no longer rate it True. We recognize that the Institute of Medicine is still widely respected, but an ideologically diverse group of experts is giving credence to Kronick's findings. That leaves us with something of a split decision, and so we downgrade our rating to .\"","sources":"http:\/\/www.iom.edu\/CMS\/3809\/54070\/63118.aspx, http:\/\/www.hsr.org\/hsr\/abstract.jsp?aid=4470695438, http:\/\/energycommerce.house.gov\/Press_111\/20090624\/testimony_goodman.pdf, http:\/\/frwebgate.access.gpo.gov\/cgi-bin\/getpage.cgi?position=all&page=H8880&dbname=2009_record, http:\/\/www.urban.org\/UploadedPDF\/411588_uninsured_dying.pdf, http:\/\/www.nap.edu\/catalog.php?record_id=10367","label":3,"subjects":"National, Health Care, Bill Pascrell, ","__index_level_0__":6916,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"On July 30, 2009, PolitiFact rated as True a statement by Democratic Rep.

However, Richard Kronick's study challenges this by adjusting for demographic and health factors, concluding the risk of mortality is no different for uninsured compared to insured individuals, suggesting the number of deaths attributable to lack of insurance could be significantly lower. Thus, while the initial study supports the claim, subsequent research presents strong evidence against it, leading to a conclusion that the claim is partially true and false."}

The strength of the evidence underlying the recommendations is not discussed and the actual amount of potential benefit from statin therapy is not mentioned, nor is the potential for harm adequately elaborated upon. Perhaps what is most missing from this \u201cjust-the-facts ma\u2019am\u201d article on the USPSTF\u2019s recommendations is the larger sense of context: major statin trials have all been funded by statin manufacturers where we know that adverse event information is incomplete and sometimes hidden, benefits are typically exaggerated as they are expressed in relative risk reductions, and that most people, physicians and patients included, will likely overestimate the benefit they might derive from statin therapy. Above all, the medicalizing of cholesterol levels in otherwise healthy people is considered by some to be\u00a0among the biggest current scandals in medicine. Having said that, it was good to see this article tipping\u00a0the hat toward those who have put forward very strong arguments against the measuring and altering of our blood cholesterols, mentioning the questionable chance of benefit and the many potential harms. It also was good to see that the article noted that there were at least two sides to this issue and that \u201cIndividual\u00a0doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\u201d \u00a0 Because this recommendation affects millions of Americans, how well it is understood, especially around the potential magnitude of benefit and potential for harm from long-term statin treatment, has huge implications for the health of the population.

The mask design was lab tested to ensure safety and effectiveness. **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained a page, \u201cN95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks),\u201d defining the terms used during discussions of PPE shortages; linked on that page was a March 11 2020 letter from the FDA about coping with PPE shortages in a clinical environment:N95 respirators and surgical masks (face masks) are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated?

Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks. If you know how to sew, have a sewing machine, and are up for that challenge, here\u2019s how you can help:Pick up a kit that will include all the materials you need to make 100 masks. We\u2019ll offer various pick-up and drop-off times and locations. The first date and location for picking up a kit is [listed. ]Be sure to check back for future kit distribution dates and locations as we will be updating regularly.A contact form providing the organizers of the 100 Million Mask Challenge with information for volunteers followed; filling out the form did not lead to any additional information on the kits\u2019 contents or parameters.Organizing the 100 Million Mask Challenge appeared to be\u00a0Providence.org, described on the site\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page as \u201cthe largest health care provider in Washington state\u201d:Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state. Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available.

The mask design was lab tested to ensure safety and effectiveness. **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained a page, \u201cN95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks),\u201d defining the terms used during discussions of PPE shortages; linked on that page was a March 11 2020 letter from the FDA about coping with PPE shortages in a clinical environment:N95 respirators and surgical masks (face masks) are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated? Including the school lunches they are delivering?? Doesnt the virus live on things for a period of time? Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks. If you know how to sew, have a sewing machine, and are up for that challenge, here\u2019s how you can help:Pick up a kit that will include all the materials you need to make 100 masks. We\u2019ll offer various pick-up and drop-off times and locations. The first date and location for picking up a kit is [listed. ]Be sure to check back for future kit distribution dates and locations as we will be updating regularly.A contact form providing the organizers of the 100 Million Mask Challenge with information for volunteers followed; filling out the form did not lead to any additional information on the kits\u2019 contents or parameters.Organizing the 100 Million Mask Challenge appeared to be\u00a0Providence.org, described on the site\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page as \u201cthe largest health care provider in Washington state\u201d:Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state. Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.n\nClaim: Homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other PPE is partially true and false. According to the CDC, in times of critical shortages, healthcare professionals might use homemade masks as a last resort. However, these masks are not considered PPE, as their effectiveness in protecting against coronavirus is unknown. The CDC emphasizes that this approach should only be used when absolutely necessary and ideally in combination with a face shield. This suggests that while homemade masks can provide some level of protection in desperate situations, they are not sufficiently reliable or recommended under normal circumstances where better protective equipment is available."}

The meme gets many details of Carson\u2019s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson\u2019s past and his plans if elected president. Carson has said he wants to eliminate government dependency, but he also has made clear he intends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them. Carson hasn\u2019t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated. Overall, the meme is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.","fact_checkers":"Katie Sanders","premise":"\"With Ben Carson officially in the ring of Republican presidential contenders, Democratic social media activists are using his famous scraps-to-scalpel narrative against him. Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family. The Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"\"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\" \"\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. \"\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\" A reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. \"\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\"\" he wrote. \"\" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. \u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019 This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of \"\"Ben Carson\"\" and \"\"Pell Grants\"\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college. \"\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\"\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"\"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson\u2019s \"\"family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,\"\" but didn\u2019t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson\u2019s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson\u2019s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson\u2019s past and his plans if elected president. Carson has said he wants to eliminate government dependency, but he also has made clear he intends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them. Carson hasn\u2019t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated.

So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class.

CHIP, which is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, is for children and pregnant women in families with low incomes, but not low enough to qualify for Medicaid.Since fiscal 2009, when the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established, three states \u2014 Iowa, Michigan and Tennessee \u2014 have received payments from it, according to a 2018 report from the Congressional Research Service. The three states spent a total of $108.6 million in contingency funding.\u201cStates have not had to access the contingency funds that much over time,\u201d\u00a0Robin Rudowitz, associate director for the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured, told us. But, then again, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what exactly might happen.\u201d The fund was set up as a safeguard, she said.Several Democrats have criticized the White House proposal, and even Republican Sen. Susan Collins questioned why there would be a \u201ccut\u201d to CHIP. Schumer, the\u00a0Senate minority leader,\u00a0said in a statement that \u201cmillions of children rely on\u201d this money \u201cduring outbreaks of the flu and other deadly illnesses.\u201dSchumer, May 7: It appears that sabotaging our health care system to the detriment of middle-class families wasn\u2019t enough for President Trump and Republicans; now they\u2019re going after health care dollars that millions of children rely on, especially during outbreaks of the flu and other deadly illnesses. Let\u2019s be honest about what this is: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), hurting middle-class families and low-income children, to appease the most conservative special interests and feel better about blowing up the deficit to give the wealthiest few and biggest corporations huge tax breaks.It\u2019s possible an outbreak of disease could cause states to need more money for CHIP, though they\u2019d have to have higher enrollment and a shortfall in funds to qualify for a payment from the contingency fund. States \u201chave to meet both of those conditions,\u201d Rudowitz said.At a May 8 press conference, Schumer characterized the Trump proposal as \u201ctaking money away from kids who need health care.\u201dRescissions of unspent CHIP funds have occurred before, including from the contingency fund, as recently as this year, when Congress passed an omnibus spending bill.All told, the administration has proposed $15 billion for rescission \u2014 or pulling back of funding that had been authorized but not yet spent. Most of the funding isn\u2019t expected to be used, in fact. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote\u00a0in a blog post that \u201cmost of these rescissions,\u201d including the ones to CHIP, \u201cwould cut budget authority for money that will not otherwise be spent,\u00a0resulting in no direct effect on the deficit.\u201dCRFB points out that the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget estimates that the $15 billion package would only reduce federal outlays (or spending), and therefore the deficit, by $3 billion. The plan requires congressional approval.Overall, since fiscal 2009, federal appropriations for CHIP have been more than enough to cover CHIP spending. Rudowitz explained that the program operates like a \u201cblock grant,\u201d so the yearly appropriations don\u2019t always equal the outlays.Through several appropriation bills, Congress has rescinded $42.8 billion from CHIP from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2017, the Congressional Research Service report said. Most of the rescissions from CHIP came from a performance bonus payment fund for states that increased Medicaid enrollment of children. And $11.1 billion came from \u201cunobligated national allotments,\u201d or federal funds not allocated to states. The CRS report said that $1.7 billion was rescinded from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund in fiscal 2016 \u2014\u00a0marking the first time rescissions were made to the emergency fund.The largest part of the Trump administration\u2019s rescission request from CHIP is $5.1 billion from funds for fiscal 2017 \u201cthat can no longer be spent,\u201d CRFB said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office explained\u00a0in a May 8 letter that those funds can no longer be distributed to states, because the authority to do so expired in 2017. So, the main issue \u2014 and the focus of Schumer\u2019s criticism \u2014 is the $1.9 billion from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund. CBO wrote that \u201cbased on information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CBO projects that the rescission from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund would not affect payments to states over the 2018-2028 period.\u201dIt said that rescinding the $7 billion in CHIP money \u201cwould not affect outlays, or the number of individuals with insurance coverage.\u201dThe budget watchdog group CRFB said the contingency money \u201clikely will not be used.\u201d\u00a0As we said, since the contingency fund was established in 2009, three states have received payments from it when they faced both a shortfall and higher-than-expected enrollment of children, according to CRS. (Total federal appropriations for CHIP were still more than enough to cover all states\u2019 spending as a whole. )Michigan got a $52.6 million payment from the fund in fiscal 2015, according to a 2016 fact sheet from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Angela Minicuci told us that the state had higher-than-expected enrollment, and a subsequent funding shortfall, due to federal poverty level changes in the Affordable Care Act.Tennessee received $226.7 million in September 2016 but only spent $27.1 million a few months later. It needed the money for \u201cretroactive CHIP expenditures as a result of changes to the CHIP eligibility standards dating back to January 1, 2014,\u201d according to Sarah Tanksley, director of communications, Division of TennCare. She said the state can no longer access the remainder of the unspent contingency payment.Iowa received $28.9 million in fiscal 2011, according to another MACPAC report. Matt Highland, public information officer at the state\u2019s Department of Human Services, told us the money covered shortfalls in fiscal 2011 and 2012.CRFB noted that a rescission from the contingency fund was made in the bipartisan omnibus spending bill passed in March.The omnibus rescinded nearly $2 billion from the fund. It passed the Senate by a 65-32 vote, with many Democrats voting yes. \u201cIn other words, most who are attacking this policy now for \u2018cutting\u2019 CHIP supported nearly the same policy just a few months ago,\u201d\u00a0Patrick Newton, press secretary at CRFB, told us in an email.Schumer was asked in a May 8 press conference why he supported the omnibus but objects to a similar rescission now. He said the difference was that the omnibus money was used for \u201cgood things.\u201d But now Trump is \u201cnot putting the money into good things; he\u2019s just cutting.\u201d Schumer went on to say: \u201cThey\u2019re just taking money away from kids who need health care.\u201dWe asked his office how the senator could say the rescission was \u201ctaking money away from kids\u201d when the money hadn\u2019t been allocated and isn\u2019t expected to be spent at all. Schumer\u2019s office responded in an email: \u201cIt has been used in the past though. It\u2019s there in case of emergency.\u201dHis office maintains the contingency money might be needed and should be preserved. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be gambling with those programs and children\u2019s health care in order to pay down a fraction of a percent of the deficit that Republicans created with their massive tax breaks to the wealthy,\u201d Schumer\u2019s office said.One additional issue is that the new request comes on top of that omnibus rescission, leaving about $500 million in the contingency fund for fiscal 2018, which ends in less than five months on Sept. 30.Schumer\u2019s office referred us to comments by\u00a0Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, who\u00a0told the Washington Post that this \u201csets a very dangerous precedent\u201d for CHIP. Alker wrote on the center\u2019s website that \u201crescinding $2 billion from the fund undermines the very assurance it was created to provide.\u201dThe contingency fund should get a fresh influx of money in fiscal 2019, which starts Oct. 1, if current practices are followed. Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Children and Families, told us that up to 20 percent of the national allotment for CHIP is allocated to the fund each budget year. That would mean up to about $4.5 billion should go into the contingency fund next fiscal year.Federal funding for the states for CHIP will total\u00a0$22.6 billion for 2019. States recently faced a gap in federal CHIP funding of several months while Congress debated extending the program. In measures passed in late January and early February, Congress extended CHIP funding through fiscal 2027.Update, May 11: We updated this story to include information on contingency fund payments to Tennessee and Iowa.","sources":"https:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/widgets\/share\/tool?canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2018%2F05%2Fschumers-chip-spin%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtumblr%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug, https:\/\/www.senate.gov\/legislative\/LIS\/roll_call_lists\/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=2&vote=00063, https:\/\/www.macpac.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/CHIP-Factsheet-December-2016.pdf, https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/POTUS-Rescission-Transmittal-Package-5.8.2018.pdf, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2018%2F05%2Fschumers-chip-spin%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug&t=Schumer%27s%20CHIP%20Spin, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/economy\/trump-calls-on-congress-to-pull-back-15-billion-in-spending-including-on-childrens-health-insurance-program\/2018\/05\/07\/9427de18-5216-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html?utm_term=.0aca481414eb, https:\/\/twitter.com\/SenStabenow\/status\/993635692331851776, https:\/\/www.macpac.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/March-2012-MACStats.pdf, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Schumer%27s%20CHIP%20Spin&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2018%2F05%2Fschumers-chip-spin%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug&via=factcheckdotorg, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2018\/05\/08\/are-republicans-really-proposing-to-cut-funding-for-poor-kids-health-insurance\/?utm_term=.dbc12be56702, https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?c4728882\/schumer-chip, https:\/\/www.governor.pa.gov\/wolf-casey-oppose-white-house-chip-health-care-cuts\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/RonWyden\/status\/993616397761642500, https:\/\/fas.org\/sgp\/crs\/misc\/R43949.pdf, https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/system\/files\/115th-congress-2017-2018\/costestimate\/proposedrescissionsforchip.pdf, http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/floor-action\/senate\/386828-senate-gop-warms-to-trumps-rescissions-package, https:\/\/ccf.georgetown.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Healthy-Kids-Access-Acts-FINAL-1.pdf, https:\/\/ccf.georgetown.edu\/2018\/05\/08\/7-billion-in-chip-cuts\/, https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/115th-congress\/house-bill\/1625\/text, http:\/\/www.crfb.org\/blogs\/whats-presidents-rescission-request, https:\/\/ccf.georgetown.edu\/author\/joan-alker\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/RepTedDeutch\/status\/993660093722976259","label":3,"subjects":" children's health insurance, government spending, ","__index_level_0__":1155,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThe White House has proposed rescinding $7 billion in unspent funds from a children\u2019s health program, a move Sen.

Also, while it may be unusual in the United States to feed dead birds to pets, in China freeze-dried birds, such as quail, are sold as pet food.","fact_checkers":"Dan Evon","premise":"In February 2020, reports started to circulate about a traveler from Beijing who had a \u201csuitcase full of dead birds\u201d confiscated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after he tried to \u201cdisguise\u201d the item as pet food:  These reports were based on a genuine incident that occurred at Washington Dulles International Airport on Feb. 10, 2020. However, this traveler did not attempt to \u201cdisguise\u201d this item as a pet food product or try to hide it from customs officials. The traveler declared the single, sealed package of pet food to customs officials. And while those residing in the United States may not consider dead birds as a treat for pets, small freeze-dried birds, such as quail, are sold as pet food in Asia. This rumor spun off of a release from CBP about a bag of dead birds that was confiscated from a traveler\u2019s luggage at Dulles: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists recently seized a package of tiny dead birds in a passenger\u2019s baggage at Washington Dulles International Airport. The traveler arrived on a flight from Beijing, China January 27 and was destined to an address in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. During a baggage examination, CBP agriculture specialists discovered a package with pictures of a cat and dog that the passenger said was cat food. The package contained a bunch of unknown small birds, about 2.5 to 3.5 inches in length. While this was a rather mundane incident, it occurred during heightened concerns about the spread of a new coronavirus in China and sparked a flurry of news coverage, some of which appeared to play on people\u2019s fears. Note the creepy, ominous music in this clip from WUSA: Other reports contained misleading details. For instance, some outlets reported that this person\u2019s suitcase \u2014 and not a sealed package in a suitcase \u2014 was full of dead birds. Others were overly dismissive about the traveler\u2019s claim that these birds were pet food, writing that \u201ca package of tiny dead birds [was] passed off as pet food.\u201d The Daily Mail went as far as to claim this traveler had \u201cdisguised\u201d these dead birds as pet food. This led some on social media to believe that the passenger had ulterior motives, had hidden this package from authorities, or was attempting to spread disease in the United States: Anything hidden coming from China should be banned and those people should be punished. There was an Ulterior Motive there. Call for an investigation. Some people are wanting to spread everything to the United States and everywhere else in the world. Other social media users wondered if this was an act of terrorism: Does anyone know why someone would travel with dead birds packaged to look like pet food? Is it cultural food item\/medicine, it\u2019s it terrorism? A crazy person who freeze dried all her dead birds for companionship? There is nothing online for this answer that I could find. We reached out to CBP for more information about this incident. The agency told us that the traveler declared this item to border agents. In other words, no one attempted to \u201chide\u201d it from officials. CBP also confirmed that the single package was sealed, so the suitcase wasn\u2019t full of loose dead birds, and that it wasn\u2019t a package of pet food emptied and filled again with dead birds in an attempt to smuggle it through customs. Lastly, CBP told us that this was treated as a \u201croutine case of a traveler in possession of prohibited agriculture products.\u201d\u00a0 Steve Sapp, a public affairs officer with CBP, told us: It should also be noted that while the words \u201cpet food\u201d don\u2019t typically conjure up images of dead birds for those residing in the United States, this is a genuine pet food product sold in China. From what we can tell, this package contained \u201csmall freeze dried quail.\u201d While we haven\u2019t been able to find this specific brand of quail, we did find several similar pet food products:","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Critter Country, COVID-19","__index_level_0__":2008,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn February 2020, reports started to circulate about a traveler from Beijing who had a \u201csuitcase full of dead birds\u201d confiscated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after he tried to \u201cdisguise\u201d the item as pet food:  These reports were based on a genuine incident that occurred at Washington Dulles International Airport on Feb. 10, 2020.

Note the creepy, ominous music in this clip from WUSA: Other reports contained misleading details. For instance, some outlets reported that this person\u2019s suitcase \u2014 and not a sealed package in a suitcase \u2014 was full of dead birds. Others were overly dismissive about the traveler\u2019s claim that these birds were pet food, writing that \u201ca package of tiny dead birds [was] passed off as pet food.\u201d The Daily Mail went as far as to claim this traveler had \u201cdisguised\u201d these dead birds as pet food. This led some on social media to believe that the passenger had ulterior motives, had hidden this package from authorities, or was attempting to spread disease in the United States: Anything hidden coming from China should be banned and those people should be punished. There was an Ulterior Motive there. Call for an investigation. Some people are wanting to spread everything to the United States and everywhere else in the world. Other social media users wondered if this was an act of terrorism: Does anyone know why someone would travel with dead birds packaged to look like pet food? Is it cultural food item\/medicine, it\u2019s it terrorism? A crazy person who freeze dried all her dead birds for companionship? There is nothing online for this answer that I could find. We reached out to CBP for more information about this incident. The agency told us that the traveler declared this item to border agents. In other words, no one attempted to \u201chide\u201d it from officials. CBP also confirmed that the single package was sealed, so the suitcase wasn\u2019t full of loose dead birds, and that it wasn\u2019t a package of pet food emptied and filled again with dead birds in an attempt to smuggle it through customs. Lastly, CBP told us that this was treated as a \u201croutine case of a traveler in possession of prohibited agriculture products.\u201d\u00a0 Steve Sapp, a public affairs officer with CBP, told us: It should also be noted that while the words \u201cpet food\u201d don\u2019t typically conjure up images of dead birds for those residing in the United States, this is a genuine pet food product sold in China. From what we can tell, this package contained \u201csmall freeze dried quail.\u201d While we haven\u2019t been able to find this specific brand of quail, we did find several similar pet food products:n\nClaim: A traveler from Beijing was caught at Dulles International Airport with a suitcase full of dead birds that the person tried to disguise as pet food. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim contains elements that are both true and false. It is true that a traveler from Beijing was caught at Dulles International Airport with dead birds, but these were in a single, sealed package declared as pet food, not a 'suitcase full' as the claim exaggerates. Additionally, there was no attempt to disguise the package as something else; the traveler declared it openly to customs officials. Therefore, while the traveler did have dead birds intended as pet food, the details about the quantity and the alleged disguise are incorrect."}

On Dec. 12, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Chicago Tribune posted an article with the headline \u201cTrump Administration Proposes Social Security Rule Changes That Could Cut Off Thousands of Disabled Recipients.\u201d The article reported that: \u201cThe Trump administration is proposing changes to Social Security that could terminate disability payments to hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly older people and children. The new rule would change aspects of disability reviews \u2014 the methods by which the Social Security Administration determines whether a person continues to qualify for benefits. Few recipients are aware of the proposal, which is open for public comment through January.\u201d The left-leaning website Common Dreams published an article with the headline \u201c\u2018A National Disgrace\u2019: Trump Proposes Social Security Change That Could End Disability Benefits for Hundreds of Thousands. '\u201d That story reported: \u201cActivists are working to raise public awareness and outrage over a little-noticed Trump administration proposal that could strip life-saving disability benefits from hundreds of thousands of people by further complicating the way the Social Security Administration determines who is eligible for payments.\u201d On the face of it, the changes proposed by the Trump administration would not, in fact, directly or immediately strip disability benefits from thousands of would-be recipients, rather the changes would introduce more (and more frequent) eligibility reviews for those who wish to receive them. However, some critics have argued that those increased bureaucratic requirements would over-burden some would-be recipients, in particular especially vulnerable recipients, and would ultimately (albeit indirectly) result in thousands losing disability benefits. The Social Security Administration distributes disability benefits in two principle ways: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their previous Social Security tax contributions and history of work, and is paid out of the Social Security insurance fund; and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which typically provides benefits to people based on their disability status and inability to work, and is paid out of general tax coffers. In order to prevent potential abuse and waste in the system, the Social Security Administration conducts \u201ccontinuing disability reviews,\u201d essentially investigating whether each recipient still has a disabling condition, and if so, which kind. Those reviews take place more or less frequently, depending on the nature of each individual\u2019s disability, broken into three \u201cmedical diary categories,\u201d as follows: In November, the Social Security Administration published its proposals to make several changes to the review system. The most significant proposal was to add a fourth medical diary category, \u201cMedical Improvement Likely.\u201d Recipients placed in that category would undergo a review every two years. According to a document accompanying the proposals, the decision to introduce the fourth category was made, in part, because the administration saw a pattern whereby some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category were being prematurely subjected to re-evaluation, after six-18 months, before a medical improvement had the chance to take hold, and some in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category had successfully treated their impairment comfortably within the three-year review interval. The introduction of the new category would therefore mean the bureaucratic burden on some recipients would actually be lessened, since they would be subject to review less frequently, though clearly it would also mean others would be subject to more frequent reviews. On the whole, the administration has estimated that, between 2020 and 2029, the new category would tend towards requiring more frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Possible\u201d category, rather than less frequent reviews for those currently in the \u201cMedical Improvement Expected\u201d category:  The administration expects the introduction of the \u201cMedical Improvement Likely\u201d category to lead to an 18 percent increase in the total number of reviews undertaken over the next decade. This would therefore lead to an increased up-front cost in administering the disability benefits programs, and an increased aggregate bureaucratic burden to recipients (even if some individual recipients would actually undergo reviews less frequently). Greater scrutiny of individual cases, and enhanced enforcement of eligibility criteria, results in some recipients no longer being deemed eligible, and no longer receiving either SSDI or SSI, which saves money for the Social Security insurance fund and the Treasury, respectively. For the 2015 fiscal year, for example, the Social Security Administration calculated a 19.9:1 return on investment rate for disability benefits enforcement \u2014 meaning that for every $1 spent on performing reviews, the government would save $19.90 on disability benefits that would otherwise have been paid, over the course of a lifetime, to recipients who are now deemed ineligible. To be specific, the administration estimated that the $717 million spent on reviews in 2015 would ultimately save $14.3 billion in lifetime disability benefit payments. So the introduction of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals is highly likely to ultimately lead to thousands of disability benefits recipients no longer receiving those benefits \u2014 both because some will be overburdened by the bureaucratic demands of more frequent reviews, and because some recipients whose medical status no longer meets the eligibility criteria will have that ineligibility discovered sooner.

{"claim_id":10278,"hypothesis":"Yoga May Help Low Back Pain. Mental Effects? Not So Much","date_published":"October 25, 2011","explanation_1":"It is an interesting point to explore, since the study authors mentioned it as well. But the journalist could have dug a little deeper and noticed the study was never designed to prove this point\u2014and didn\u2019t. So the Wall St. Journal led with a mischaracterization of the study results. The study found that yoga and intensive stretching exercises were equally effective in relieving pain and enhancing function\u2014and that both were superior to a self-care educational booklet in the management of chronic back pain at the primary study endpoint of 12 weeks. \u201cFinding similar effects for both approaches suggests that yoga\u2019s benefits were largely attributable to the physical benefits of stretching and not to its mental component,\u201d the authors wrote in the discussion section. But this is just an opinion. And it is just as possible that both group interventions\u2014yoga and intensive stretching\u2014had physical and mental benefits in the management of low back pain. A recent article in the Lancet pointed out that the causes of low back pain are generally obscure, as are the mechanisms of pain relief. (See Balagu\u00e9 et al., 2011) The Wall St. Journal article offered a brief but useful description of the study, its background, and context. But as with a New York Times article on the same topic, there was a hole in the coverage. The journalist included the views of the study authors but offered no perspectives from independent experts. The study had an important limitation that should have at least been mentioned. The researchers studied relatively affluent subjects with mild, uncomplicated back pain that did not result in substantial functional problems. So the results may not apply to the individuals who bear the heaviest burden from chronic back pain and related disability: those on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, those with medicolegal dilemmas in the workplace, and those with other more complicated mental and physical health problems. The study also did not compare yoga to the \u201cusual treatments\u201d for low back pain offered in the U.S. medical system. So yoga\u2019s overall benefits may not be quite as clear as the Wall St. Journal article suggests. Chronic back pain is a huge social, economic, and medical problem. In the United States, back pain is the ninth most expensive medical condition for women, and the 10th for men, in terms of direct medical costs\u2014with chronic back pain accounting for a disproportionate chunk of those expenses. And the costs of work absence and disability claims related to back pain vastly exceed the medical price tag. Though Americans spend almost $35 billion per year on the medical treatment of back pain, the prevalence of chronic back pain appears to be rising\u2014and self-rated spinal health among Americans appears be declining. (See Soni, 2011; Freburger et al., 2009; and Martin et al., 2008). A number of nonsurgical treatments\u2014analgesics, exercise, manual therapies, complementary\/alternative therapies, psychological interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation\u2014are modestly effective in the management of chronic back pain. Yet for various reasons, Americans overuse ineffective treatments and underuse effective ones. (See Carey et al., 2009). So the identification of treatments that facilitate recovery and are popular with patients is a key social and medical priority.

Gavin Newsom dedicated his second State of the State address almost entirely to California\u2019s deepening homelessness crisis. He said the problem today requires \"\"a coordinated crisis-level response,\"\" one that gets \"\"the mentally ill out of tents and into treatment\"\" and produces affordable housing to ensure no Californian is homeless. But Newsom also said the crisis \"\"has persisted for decades\"\" and made a claim that suggests it was worse 15 years ago. \"\"Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. \u2026 That\u2019s 35,000 more than we have today,\"\" Newsom said during his address, held at the state Capitol. Those figures caught our attention. Has the state\u2019s homeless population really dropped by 35,000 over the past decade and a half? We set out on a fact check. \u2018Apples To Oranges\u2019 Comparison? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development tracks homeless figures for each state based on point-in-time counts conducted every two years by local agencies. For 2005, HUD listed California\u2019s homeless population at 188,299, matching Newsom\u2019s figure. Last month, HUD released its 2019 report showing California had 151,278 homeless people, or about 37,000 fewer than in 2005. That also generally lines up with the governor\u2019s statement. But we found there\u2019s been a major change in how homeless people are counted since 2005. At that time, some communities, including Los Angeles County, would count the \"\"the hidden homeless,\"\" or those who were temporarily living in a motel or on someone\u2019s couch, in addition to those who lived on the streets, in cars, shelters or abandoned buildings. HUD stopped allowing the practice of counting the hidden homeless several years ago. That makes comparing past data to today\u2019s \"\"apples to oranges,\"\" said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness. \"\"It\u2019s not even close.\"\" Sharron Rapport, director of the California Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, said a significant number of people who were counted as homeless residents in the past are no longer tallied. \"\"There may not be an actual decrease of 35,000 people experiencing homeless. It could just be that we counted them differently before,\"\" said Rapport, who serves on the governor\u2019s homelessness task force. Advocates for homeless people have criticized HUD\u2019s methodology for not counting these less-visible individuals. They have said point-in-time counts, which are conducted on a single night at the end of January and largely by volunteers, tally only a fraction of the total homeless population. \"\"We know there\u2019s an epidemic, right? You would have to be blind to not understand the nature of the epidemic,\"\" Margaretta Lin, executive director of the Dellums Institute for Social Justice said in a CityLab news article in 2019. \"\"But HUD defines homelessness as people who are literally homeless. People who are in a motel for that night or couch surfing for that night, under the HUD definitions, they are not considered homeless.\"\" While the change in HUD\u2019s methodology partially explains the lower homeless population, Rapport said California is also doing a better job housing people without a permanent home than it did in the past. Los Angeles County, for example, is now housing 133 homeless people per day, a significant increase from the past, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a forum last week on homelessness. The mayor noted, however, that an estimated 150 people per day are becoming homeless in the county. A More Visible Crisis Setting the numbers aside, Rapport said there are several reasons homelessness is more visible now compared with 15 years ago. For one, it\u2019s in more communities. \"\"It used to be more concentrated in specific areas. Now it is more dispersed,\"\" Rapport said. \"\"We see homelessness in every part of our state. \u2026 It\u2019s not just in our urban centers, it\u2019s in our suburban areas, it\u2019s in our rural areas. People notice it more, I think, because of that.\"\" The high-profile Hepatitis A outbreaks that spread in homeless communities in San Diego and Los Angeles, along with more media coverage of the topic have also raised awareness, she said. When we asked about Newsom\u2019s statement, the governor\u2019s office told us it\u2019s \"\"not a perfect\"\" comparison. But, they said, the federal reports are the only comprehensive source available. They added that Newsom was not trying to suggest that the crisis has improved, just the opposite. Our Ruling Newsom claimed: \"\"Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. \u2026 That\u2019s 35,000 more than we have today.\"\" His figures are technically right based on homelessness reports issued every two years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Gavin Newsom dedicated his second State of the State address almost entirely to California\u2019s deepening homelessness crisis. He said the problem today requires \"\"a coordinated crisis-level response,\"\" one that gets \"\"the mentally ill out of tents and into treatment\"\" and produces affordable housing to ensure no Californian is homeless. But Newsom also said the crisis \"\"has persisted for decades\"\" and made a claim that suggests it was worse 15 years ago. \"\"Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. \u2026 That\u2019s 35,000 more than we have today,\"\" Newsom said during his address, held at the state Capitol. Those figures caught our attention. Has the state\u2019s homeless population really dropped by 35,000 over the past decade and a half? We set out on a fact check. \u2018Apples To Oranges\u2019 Comparison? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development tracks homeless figures for each state based on point-in-time counts conducted every two years by local agencies. For 2005, HUD listed California\u2019s homeless population at 188,299, matching Newsom\u2019s figure. Last month, HUD released its 2019 report showing California had 151,278 homeless people, or about 37,000 fewer than in 2005. That also generally lines up with the governor\u2019s statement. But we found there\u2019s been a major change in how homeless people are counted since 2005. At that time, some communities, including Los Angeles County, would count the \"\"the hidden homeless,\"\" or those who were temporarily living in a motel or on someone\u2019s couch, in addition to those who lived on the streets, in cars, shelters or abandoned buildings. HUD stopped allowing the practice of counting the hidden homeless several years ago. That makes comparing past data to today\u2019s \"\"apples to oranges,\"\" said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness. \"\"It\u2019s not even close.\"\" Sharron Rapport, director of the California Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, said a significant number of people who were counted as homeless residents in the past are no longer tallied. \"\"There may not be an actual decrease of 35,000 people experiencing homeless. It could just be that we counted them differently before,\"\" said Rapport, who serves on the governor\u2019s homelessness task force. Advocates for homeless people have criticized HUD\u2019s methodology for not counting these less-visible individuals. They have said point-in-time counts, which are conducted on a single night at the end of January and largely by volunteers, tally only a fraction of the total homeless population. \"\"We know there\u2019s an epidemic, right? You would have to be blind to not understand the nature of the epidemic,\"\" Margaretta Lin, executive director of the Dellums Institute for Social Justice said in a CityLab news article in 2019. \"\"But HUD defines homelessness as people who are literally homeless. People who are in a motel for that night or couch surfing for that night, under the HUD definitions, they are not considered homeless.\"\" While the change in HUD\u2019s methodology partially explains the lower homeless population, Rapport said California is also doing a better job housing people without a permanent home than it did in the past. Los Angeles County, for example, is now housing 133 homeless people per day, a significant increase from the past, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a forum last week on homelessness. The mayor noted, however, that an estimated 150 people per day are becoming homeless in the county. A More Visible Crisis Setting the numbers aside, Rapport said there are several reasons homelessness is more visible now compared with 15 years ago. For one, it\u2019s in more communities. \"\"It used to be more concentrated in specific areas. Now it is more dispersed,\"\" Rapport said. \"\"We see homelessness in every part of our state. \u2026 It\u2019s not just in our urban centers, it\u2019s in our suburban areas, it\u2019s in our rural areas. People notice it more, I think, because of that.\"\" The high-profile Hepatitis A outbreaks that spread in homeless communities in San Diego and Los Angeles, along with more media coverage of the topic have also raised awareness, she said. When we asked about Newsom\u2019s statement, the governor\u2019s office told us it\u2019s \"\"not a perfect\"\" comparison. But, they said, the federal reports are the only comprehensive source available. They added that Newsom was not trying to suggest that the crisis has improved, just the opposite. Our Ruling Newsom claimed: \"\"Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. \u2026 That\u2019s 35,000 more than we have today.\"\" His figures are technically right based on homelessness reports issued every two years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But his statement ignores a key change in how the reports count homeless people. In the past, they tallied a large number of \"\"hidden homeless,\"\" those living temporarily at a friend\u2019s home or motel. Today, those people are no longer counted, meaning Newsom\u2019s comparison is problematic, at best. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Gavin Newsom's 2020 State Of The State One year in, Gov.

Gavin Newsom that in 2005 there were over 188,000 homeless people in California, which is 35,000 more than today, is technically correct based on the figures provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. However, the comparison is flawed due to changes in how the counts were conducted. Previously, the counts included 'hidden homeless' people who were temporarily living in motels or with friends, which are not included in more recent counts. This significant change in methodology means that while the numbers themselves are accurate, the implication that homelessness has decreased could be misleading, as it doesn't account for this change in counting practices."}

The story\u2019s main strength is that it provided caveats early and often about the small size and short duration of the study and the need for more rigorous trials. However, it didn\u2019t give enough information to help readers understand whether weight loss and blood pressure improvements were sufficient to reduce disease risk. The headline also oversells the findings by stating that the fasting plan is \u201clinked to weight loss and health benefits.\u201d In fact, the study found most metabolic risk factors unchanged. The story also would have been stronger had it used people-first language to help reduce stigma around obesity. There\u2019s a lot of excitement around Intermittent fasting as a strategy to lose weight and reduce risk factors for metabolic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The so-called 16:8 fasting diet is just the latest flavor. Early-phase studies like this one provide just a clue of how well they work. News reporting needs to refrain from hyperbole and focus on the many caveats around these trials. This one did a little bit, but not enough.","fact_checkers":"Mary Chris Jaklevic,Yoni Freedhoff, MD,Joy Victory","premise":"There\u2019s no cost associated with following this diet.
