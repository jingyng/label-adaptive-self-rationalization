It plans by June to boost production to \u201chigh double-digit millions\u201d per month, with the tests due to be run on more than 40,000 of Roche\u2019s cobas e testing machines installed worldwide. The test identifies antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the body, suggesting possible immunity.

Diasorin SpA of Italy is among those developing an antibody test which it hopes to put to use this month. Chief Executive Carlo Rosa told Reuters last week that demand is immense, a situation that parallels the global scramble for ventilators to keep critically ill patients alive. \u201cWe won\u2019t be in a position to respond to the enormous demand that there will be for these tests on our own,\u201d said Rosa, adding Diasorin has 5,000 testing platforms installed globally, including 500 in Italy, which can process 170 samples an hour.

Another 35 percent reduction will come in 2012. The auto and other industries are under constant pressure to raise fuel economy or tap new technologies because their customers often burn through dozens or more gallons of gasoline each month. As gas prices rise, so does the strain on pocketbooks.

By 2013, Jore plans to have a broader range of products, including a lawn mower and leaf blower that don\u2019t use gas. But even the most established global players are finding it hard to turn the tide.

According to the report, more than 9,000 children age 12 and younger died in a car crash from 2002 to 2011. \u201cThe good news is motor vehicle deaths decreased by 43 percent over the past decade for children age 12 and younger. The tragic news is still with that decrease, more than 9,000 kids were killed on the road in this period,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference. \u201cThousands of children are at risk on the road because they are not buckled up,\u201d he said.

The study did not investigate why racial differences played such a big role in seat belt use, but it did suggest socio-economic factors may play a role. For the study, CDC researchers analyzed data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find the number of deaths among occupants in cars from 2002 to 2011 for all children aged up to the age of 12.

{"claim_id":2442,"hypothesis":"Pesticide ban cuts South Korea's high suicide rate - a bit.","date_published":"September 30, 2013","explanation_1":"Jang Chang-yoon was drunk and weepy one rainy night, troubled by debts from his divorce. On a dark impulse, the South Korean waiter bought a bottle of pesticide to end it all with a few toxic swigs.","fact_checkers":"Ju-Min Park","premise":"At the last minute, he changed his mind when his young daughter grabbed his arm and begged him: \u201cDaddy, don\u2019t die.\u201d  Unlike Jang, many people do not pull back from the brink in South Korea, which has had the highest suicide rate in the developed world for nine straight years, often drinking pesticide as their way out. But a decade after Jang\u2019s brush with death, a ban on fatal pesticides is credited with cutting the number of suicides by 11 percent last year, the first drop in six years. The government restricted production of Gramoxone, a herbicide linked to suicides, in 2011 and outlawed its sale and storage last year. \u201cThe number of suicides by poisoning including Gramoxone fell by 477, which accounts for about 27 percent of the total decrease in the number of people committing suicide,\u201d Lee Jae-won, an official at Statistics Korea, said last week after the government released the latest figures. Pesticide was the method of choice for almost a quarter of the South Koreans who killed themselves between 2006 and 2010, according to a government report to parliament. In the highly competitive society of Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, experts say people who end up alone battling pressure for good school grades or from financial burdens have little in the way of a safety net. Despite the improvement in the suicide rate, more than 14,000 South Koreans killed themselves last year. Elderly people living in rural areas are a particularly high-risk group. Since the 1950s, older generations have been fixated on South Korea becoming more competitive and productive, a side effect of rapid industrialisation that turned a war-damaged country into one of the richest in the world. Kim Hyun-chung, a psychiatrist at the Korean Association for Suicide Prevention, sees social stigmas as a major reason for the high suicide rate. Many South Koreans who are depressed or under heavy stress are reluctant to bring up issues like mental illness or an inability to cope, he said. \u201cThe ban on toxic pesticides obviously led to the decline in the suicide rate because that is the easiest means of suicide for elderly people in rural towns,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBut we still have bridges and charcoal briquettes.\u201d  To help limit access to lethal chemicals, the Life Insurance Philanthropy Foundation launched a campaign to provide pesticide lockers to farming towns with high rates of depression. The foundation, set up by private insurance firms, says no one from the villages with the lockers has committed suicide over the past three years, compared with one or two people from each village who had killed themselves in past years. \u201cThe lockers help reduce the impulse to get hold of pesticides because they have to find keys to open them,\u201d Chung Bong-eun, an official at the foundation, told Reuters. The 2012 figures may offer a glimmer of hope, but the latest comparisons by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed South Korea was by far the most suicidal society, followed by Hungary, Russia and Japan. For Jang, working two jobs is still tough, but he regrets trying to kill himself and is happy to have his life to share with his two daughters. While he sees the ban on pesticides as a positive step, he feels for others who are under duress. \u201cOld and young people have their own pain from either quick economic development or unemployment,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope the government will care more about people\u2019s health.\u201d","sources":" ","label":0,"subjects":"Health News","__index_level_0__":925,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nAt the last minute, he changed his mind when his young daughter grabbed his arm and begged him: \u201cDaddy, don\u2019t die.\u201d  Unlike Jang, many people do not pull back from the brink in South Korea, which has had the highest suicide rate in the developed world for nine straight years, often drinking pesticide as their way out.

Pesticide was the method of choice for almost a quarter of the South Koreans who killed themselves between 2006 and 2010, according to a government report to parliament. In the highly competitive society of Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, experts say people who end up alone battling pressure for good school grades or from financial burdens have little in the way of a safety net. Despite the improvement in the suicide rate, more than 14,000 South Koreans killed themselves last year. Elderly people living in rural areas are a particularly high-risk group. Since the 1950s, older generations have been fixated on South Korea becoming more competitive and productive, a side effect of rapid industrialisation that turned a war-damaged country into one of the richest in the world. Kim Hyun-chung, a psychiatrist at the Korean Association for Suicide Prevention, sees social stigmas as a major reason for the high suicide rate. Many South Koreans who are depressed or under heavy stress are reluctant to bring up issues like mental illness or an inability to cope, he said. \u201cThe ban on toxic pesticides obviously led to the decline in the suicide rate because that is the easiest means of suicide for elderly people in rural towns,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBut we still have bridges and charcoal briquettes.\u201d  To help limit access to lethal chemicals, the Life Insurance Philanthropy Foundation launched a campaign to provide pesticide lockers to farming towns with high rates of depression. The foundation, set up by private insurance firms, says no one from the villages with the lockers has committed suicide over the past three years, compared with one or two people from each village who had killed themselves in past years. \u201cThe lockers help reduce the impulse to get hold of pesticides because they have to find keys to open them,\u201d Chung Bong-eun, an official at the foundation, told Reuters. The 2012 figures may offer a glimmer of hope, but the latest comparisons by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showed South Korea was by far the most suicidal society, followed by Hungary, Russia and Japan. For Jang, working two jobs is still tough, but he regrets trying to kill himself and is happy to have his life to share with his two daughters. While he sees the ban on pesticides as a positive step, he feels for others who are under duress. \u201cOld and young people have their own pain from either quick economic development or unemployment,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope the government will care more about people\u2019s health.\u201dn\nClaim: Pesticide ban cuts South Korea's high suicide rate - a bit.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"entailment","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence states that a ban on fatal pesticides is credited with reducing the number of suicides by 11 percent last year, marking the first decrease in six years. Additionally, it mentions that the number of suicides by poisoning, including from Gramoxone (a particular pesticide linked to suicides), fell by 477, accounting for about 27 percent of the overall reduction in suicide numbers. This information directly supports the claim that the pesticide ban has contributed to a decrease in South Korea's high suicide rate."}

You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally?

At the White House on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would like to reopen the U.S. economy with a \u201cbig bang\u201d but not before the death toll is on the downslope. Trump did not offer a time frame, but his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Tuesday a resumption of commerce was possible in four to eight weeks. Louisiana is \u201cbeginning to see the flattening of the curve\u201d with the number of new coronavirus cases reported in the past 24 hours - 746 - lower than recent days, Governor John Bel Edwards  said. Louisiana had been one of the nation\u2019s hot spots. California, like New York, had one of its highest single-day death tolls with 68 people dying of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, Governor Gavin Newsom said. The state may not see its infection curve flattening until the end of May, requiring weeks more of social distancing, officials say. New York City officials said a recent surge in people dying at home suggests the most populous U.S. city may be undercounting the loss of life. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very real possibility,\u201d Cuomo told his daily news briefing. So far New York City\u2019s announced death toll has reflected only laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, mostly at hospitals. At least 200 people are believed to be dying at home in the city every day during the pandemic, authorities said. Pence warned that Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were cities of \u201cparticular concern\u201d as a possible future flash points in the epidemic.n\nClaim: Speed of coronavirus deaths shock doctors as New York toll hits new high.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"entailment","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence supports the claim that the speed of coronavirus deaths has shocked doctors, as indicated by the statement from nurse Diana Torres at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, who described the sudden and severe deterioration of patients. Additionally, the evidence confirms that New York's death toll reached a new high, with Governor Cuomo stating that 779 people had died in the past day in the state, exceeding the one-day records from just a day earlier. These points directly substantiate the claim that the speed of coronavirus deaths is shocking to medical professionals and that the New York toll has hit a new high."}

A&E four hour targets have been missed more than 10 million times since 2010. Correct. Between 2010\/11 and 2017\/18, around 12 million A&E attendances in England took over four hours from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. The number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&E is up 2,700% since 2010. Correct (although not all patients will necessarily have been waiting in A&E). In 2011\/12, 120 patients in England waited 12 hours between the decision to admit them to emergency admissions and their actual admission, compared to 3,500 in 2017\/18. Spending on social care is down 8% since 2010. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said that between 2009\/10 and 2016\/17, councils\u2019 spending on adult social care in England fell 8% in real terms. Newer analysis says that it fell by 6% over the same period. We\u2019ve asked it for more information. There are 5,240 fewer mental health nurses since 2010. This seems to be looking at different months in 2010 and 2017, which isn\u2019t the best comparison. Comparing the number of full-time equivalent mental health nurses between January 2010 and January 2018 (the latest figures), the drop is closer to 4,500. The number of operations classed as urgent that have been cancelled twice have doubled since 2010. Correct. The number of urgent operations in England cancelled for the second time or more for non-medical reasons more than doubled between 2011\/12 and 2017\/18. There has been a 22% drop in ambulances meeting their 15 minute transfer target since 2010. The decrease is actually greater\u201428%. In 2010\/11 in England 80% of ambulance transfers were done in 15 minutes, in 2015\/16 it was 58%.

{"claim_id":34167,"hypothesis":"U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. ","date_published":"October 23, 2019","explanation_1":"In reality, the only consistent feature of these incidents is the inconsistency of the circumstances and context that surrounded them. As such, it appears doubtful that Trump typically brandishes his middle finger as a way of expressing disdain or anger or disrespect. A far more plausible explanation appears to be simply that, from time to time, the president\u2019s hairline or eyebrows or skin cause him irritation or discomfort, and he feels compelled to scratch that itch.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made. Anti-gun violence activist Shannon Watts tweeted out a short video clip of the incident, writing: \u201cWhen gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u2018fix\u2019 his hair. How is this even real life?\u201d When gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u201cfix\u201d his hair. How is this even real life? pic.twitter.com\/9bnj7XfY1m \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 21, 2019 \u00a0 The left-leaning Facebook page The Other 98% repurposed Watts\u2019 viral tweet in a video:  Jack Brown, whose Twitter bio describes him as a \u201cbody language and emotional intelligence expert,\u201d posted a lengthy and widely shared analysis of the president\u2019s non-verbal gestures during the incident, concluding that: \u201cThis gesture is very much what it looks like \u2014 Donald Trump is giving Astronaut Jessica Meir the finger while she\u2019s walking in space. He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201d","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":5202,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made.

He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201dn\nClaim: U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that U.S. President Donald Trump intentionally used his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who corrected him cannot be confirmed due to the lack of definitive evidence about his intent behind the gesture. The analysis and additional incidents provided show that Trump has used similar gestures in various contexts, some of which are benign and not directed at any individual in a negative manner. Without clear evidence or confirmation of Trump's intent to use the gesture as an offensive signal specifically in the incident with the astronaut, it remains speculative to conclude the gesture was meant as an act of disrespect."}

The story unfolded when bystander video emerged of Clinton nearly fainting and stumbling from a curb before her aids loaded her into a van after a 9\/11 event in New York. The situation played into conspiracy theories that Clinton has been hiding a major medical condition, most likely Parkinson\u2019s disease. Clinton\u2019s doctor, Lisa Bardack, released a statement saying that Clinton had been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia during a follow up visit on Friday: She was put on antibiotics, and was advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at (Sunday\u2019s) event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.

No information is currently\u00a0available as to whether Graves and the brand managed to come to an agreement about circumstances under which the specimen could be tested, and the claim remains unproven.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 9 May 2016, a Texas man named John Graves published several photographs to Facebook alongside a claim that he had discovered a dead rat in his grandson\u2019s partially-consumed bottle of Dr Pepper: Graves\u2019 status update read: Nothing like your grandson drinking half a Dr Pepper only to find a dead rat floating on the bottle. Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman\u2019s 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy\u2019s chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny.

Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman\u2019s 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy\u2019s chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny. Yet another, similar claim was disproven after experts said that\u00a0Mountain Dew\u00a0(and other soft drinks)\u00a0could dissolve a mouse, thanks to the acids that incorporated into their flavoring agents to give them a tanginess and bite.

{"claim_id":36157,"hypothesis":"An image shows a man's mostly-consumed Red Bull energy drink, after he found a dead mouse in the container.","date_published":"September 24, 2019","explanation_1":"Did a Man Find a Dead Mouse in a Nearly Empty Red Bull Can?","fact_checkers":"  Kim LaCapria  ","premise":"On September 5 2019, Facebook user Seth Bowman shared the following post (archived here), alongside a claim his Red Bull energy drink was contaminated by a dead mouse. According to Bowman\u2019s claim, he had nearly finished drinking the can of Red Bull when \u201cchunks\u201d alerted him to the presence of the former rodent:So I drank a whole Red Bull the other night at work and found this at the bottom. I\u2019ve tried contacting Red Bull and haven\u2019t heard a word back. So do me a favor and let\u2019s make this viral.Bowman requested that predictably disgusted Facebook users do him \u201ca favor\u201d and \u201cmake this viral\u201d; they did,\u00a0 sharing the post over 150,000 times. We did not see users sharing the post to Red Bull\u2019s social media accounts, nor did we find any public acknowledgement of Bowman\u2019s claim. A friend of the poster shared the claim to Reddit\u2019s r\/WTF, where readers were skeptical.Bowman was certainly not the first person to claim they found a dead rodent in a soft drink or energy drink. In a 1988 newspaper column, folklorist\u00a0Jan Harold Brunvand examined claims that at the time spread without Facebook or email, indicating they appeared to be as old as bottled soft drinks themselves, and instances of ostension \u2014 when people took the claim to real life.Brunvand explained how the stories existed on two levels \u2014 one being the claims as they appeared as early as 1914, and another being representative of our fears involving handing off the responsibility for food safety from our homes to faceless corporations:A search of published appeals-court records conducted in 1976 turned up 45 such cases against soda bottlers, the first in 1914. And one can only guess how many similar cases were never appealed or were settled out of court.Most of the people who tell the mouse-in-Coke legend don\u2019t know the legal history, though. What they do know is a good story, whether it\u2019s told by a friend, a neighbor or co-worker. The tellers assume that somewhere, sometime, an actual lawsuit was brought against a soft-drink bottling company.So while the lawsuits are real, the stories are not, because they are so far separated from the original facts that they\u2019ve turned into folklore. In this way, a story can be both an actual event and a legend. And the mouse-in-Coke legends, like most urban legends, have lives of their own completely separate from the facts.What has occurred, I believe, is something like this: The theme of foreign matter contaminating food is a popular one in urban legends. And \u201cCoke\u201d has become virtually a generic way to refer to soft drinks. So the legends get started and gain credibility from lawsuits that people vaguely remember, in which mice were said to be found in soda bottles. And naturally, it is usually Coke that is mentioned in the legend whether or not the original suits were against Coke.As the legend spreads by word of mouth, the trauma is exaggerated, the drama heightened. And the size of the settlement, of course, grows and grows. The end result: The indignation against the giant corporation that is selling contaminated food is pumped up to a full measure of outrage.In 2016, The Verge published a \u201cbrief history\u201d of viral claims about dead mice or rats in sodas and energy drinks. Following yet another claim involving a deceased rodent and Dr. Pepper, the news organization examined several such claims, many of which appeared in 2012.The article referenced a notable 2012 lawsuit against PepsiCo, brought by a man who alleged he found a dead mouse in a can of Mountain Dew:Ronald Ball, 52, from Madison County, Ill., claims he tasted something foul in the can of drink he purchased from a vending machine at his work.According to his lawsuit, Ball claims he spat out the soda, the Madison County Record reported. He said he \u201ctook a drink, and immediately became violently ill such that he began to vomit \u2026\u00a0The contents of said can of Mountain Dew were immediately poured into a Styrofoam cup wherein a dead mouse was found,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.Ball sent the mouse to PepsiCo \u2014 along with a letter of complaint \u2014 but the oil company worker says the soda giant destroyed the body of the mouse, and therefore, his evidence.The incident happened in November 2009 and Ball [was] seeking $50,000 damages.Ball\u2019s suit led to a rather nauseating spate of articles about whether the composition of Mountain Dew would degrade or preserve the corpse of a small animal, with lawyers arguing that the beverage would rapidly dissolve a mouse\u2019s remains:Key to Pepsi\u2019s legal argument is that there\u2019s no chance a mouse\u2019s corpse could survive, intact, for 15 months swimming in Mountain Dew. While published studies have not been conducted on how rapidly Mountain Dew would dissolve a mouse, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the neon green soda can eat away teeth and bones in a matter of months, and would likely do quite a number on a rodent.\u201cI think it is plausible that it could dissolve a mouse in a few months,\u201d said Yan-Fang Ren of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who has studied the effects of citric acid on bones and teeth. \u201cBut dissolving [the mouse] does not mean it will disappear, because you\u2019ll still have the collagen and the soft tissue part. It will be like rubber.\u201dA similar claim was reported in 2011, involving the Monster brand of energy drinks. Another brand of energy drink was at the center of similar claims in 2016, when a consumer was purportedly sickened by a dead mouse in a beverage can:[Jordan] Bell started dry heaving and went straight to a doctor, who advised he go to the hospital. At the Mission Hospital they contacted BC Poison Control and told Bell that in about 24 hours he would probably experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.And in March 2018, an Arkansas Red Bull drinker reported finding a rodent at the bottom of his can. His claim went viral on Facebook, but many users were skeptical of its legitimacy:While [claimant Josh] Henley said it was not possible the rodent got inside the can when he left it in the car overnight, many people on social media said it was the highest possibility.The video, which was shared [in March 2018], went viral and was viewed more than 100,000 times and counting. It was first shared by Henley on Facebook.Some social media users also raised doubts about the legitimacy of the video.Joshua Nightingale commented: \u201cYou drank it last night, most likely that mouse got in after you drank it and went to sleep. Wouldn\u2019t you have noticed it last night after or while you were drinking it?\u201d Another comment said: \u201cIt obviously went in after you drank it.\u201dIn a statement to Mirror Online, a spokesman for Red Bull said: \u201cIt is inconceivable that a particle \u2014 let alone anything like this \u2014 could pass through the process of world-class, modern beverage manufacture.\u201dIn April 2017, beverage corporation lawyers once again argued the claims were impossible, and that the specimen was not sufficiently decomposed:[The claimant was] suing Coca-Cola for a modest amount, having medical bills related to his illness that total around $1,000, and he missed 60 hours of work. He also says that he lost thirty pounds due to his illness.Coca-Cola, however, disputes that it\u2019s possible to find such an intact mouse in one of its beverage cans. In the time that it would take for a mouse to be sealed inside a can at a bottling plant, then for the can to be distributed to a retail store and purchased, the mouse would have decomposed enough to have \u201ccompromised the can,\u201d or given off gases that would make the can bulge or burst.An attorney from Minnesota who is on the team representing Coke explained to the Mitchell Republic that the company \u201ctakes these cases extremely seriously and tries them all,\u201d since allegations of mouse contamination are damaging to its brand. Settling for a modest amount would be cheaper and easier, but the company would rather defend itself at trial \u2026 The plaintiff is seeking $2,026 and general damages, plus interest.That coverage raised two interesting aspects about dead-mouse-in-soda-can claims: that beverage companies maintain that they always take such suits to trial, and tacitly that claims of this sort seem to be somewhat common. It also appears that beverage manufacturers often feel confident rodent-in-soda claims are unlikely to hold up in court. The outlet quoted above also linked to a similar legal claim, with findings that the creature was a \u201ctoad\u201d and that no mechanism for its presence was ever determined.In 2012, however, Ball\u2019s claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and it was conditional in part on PepsiCo disclaiming responsibility. The 2009 case involving what appeared to be a toad yielded little useful information with respect to such contamination and how it might occur. At the time, a PepsiCo spokesman declined via email to speculate on how the toad got there:The FDA also conducted an investigation at the local Pepsi bottling plant in Orlando from August 4 to 11 [2009] and \u201cdid not find any adverse conditions or association to this problem,\u201d spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said.\u201cWe have not determined when or how the contamination occurred,\u201d DeLancey said in an e-mail.Pepsi says the FDA results \u201caffirmed\u201d the company\u2019s confidence \u201cin the quality of our products and the integrity of our manufacturing system,\u201d according to spokesman Jeff Dahncke.\u201cThe speed of our production lines and the rigor of our quality control systems make it virtually impossible for this type of thing to happen in a production environment. In fact, there never has been even a single instance when a claim of this nature has been traced back to a manufacturing issue \u2026\u00a0The FDA conducted a thorough inspection of our Orlando facility and found no cause for concern. In this case, the FDA simply was unable to determine when or how the specimen entered the package.\u201dWhen asked if Pepsi believed it was not responsible for the animal getting into the can, Dahncke said, \u201cWe have addressed the facts of the investigation and stated our position. It\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment beyond that.\u201dA September 2019 Facebook post claiming a user found a dead mouse in his can of Red Bull was virally popular, but neither unique in structure nor even as it pertained to Red Bull. Stories about dead rodents in bottled or canned soft drinks date back more than a century, and occasionally cross from the realm of folklore into the news by way of claims like the one to hand.

According to Bowman\u2019s claim, he had nearly finished drinking the can of Red Bull when \u201cchunks\u201d alerted him to the presence of the former rodent:So I drank a whole Red Bull the other night at work and found this at the bottom. I\u2019ve tried contacting Red Bull and haven\u2019t heard a word back. So do me a favor and let\u2019s make this viral.Bowman requested that predictably disgusted Facebook users do him \u201ca favor\u201d and \u201cmake this viral\u201d; they did,\u00a0 sharing the post over 150,000 times. We did not see users sharing the post to Red Bull\u2019s social media accounts, nor did we find any public acknowledgement of Bowman\u2019s claim. A friend of the poster shared the claim to Reddit\u2019s r\/WTF, where readers were skeptical.Bowman was certainly not the first person to claim they found a dead rodent in a soft drink or energy drink. In a 1988 newspaper column, folklorist\u00a0Jan Harold Brunvand examined claims that at the time spread without Facebook or email, indicating they appeared to be as old as bottled soft drinks themselves, and instances of ostension \u2014 when people took the claim to real life.Brunvand explained how the stories existed on two levels \u2014 one being the claims as they appeared as early as 1914, and another being representative of our fears involving handing off the responsibility for food safety from our homes to faceless corporations:A search of published appeals-court records conducted in 1976 turned up 45 such cases against soda bottlers, the first in 1914. And one can only guess how many similar cases were never appealed or were settled out of court.Most of the people who tell the mouse-in-Coke legend don\u2019t know the legal history, though. What they do know is a good story, whether it\u2019s told by a friend, a neighbor or co-worker. The tellers assume that somewhere, sometime, an actual lawsuit was brought against a soft-drink bottling company.So while the lawsuits are real, the stories are not, because they are so far separated from the original facts that they\u2019ve turned into folklore. In this way, a story can be both an actual event and a legend. And the mouse-in-Coke legends, like most urban legends, have lives of their own completely separate from the facts.What has occurred, I believe, is something like this: The theme of foreign matter contaminating food is a popular one in urban legends. And \u201cCoke\u201d has become virtually a generic way to refer to soft drinks. So the legends get started and gain credibility from lawsuits that people vaguely remember, in which mice were said to be found in soda bottles. And naturally, it is usually Coke that is mentioned in the legend whether or not the original suits were against Coke.As the legend spreads by word of mouth, the trauma is exaggerated, the drama heightened. And the size of the settlement, of course, grows and grows. The end result: The indignation against the giant corporation that is selling contaminated food is pumped up to a full measure of outrage.In 2016, The Verge published a \u201cbrief history\u201d of viral claims about dead mice or rats in sodas and energy drinks. Following yet another claim involving a deceased rodent and Dr. Pepper, the news organization examined several such claims, many of which appeared in 2012.The article referenced a notable 2012 lawsuit against PepsiCo, brought by a man who alleged he found a dead mouse in a can of Mountain Dew:Ronald Ball, 52, from Madison County, Ill., claims he tasted something foul in the can of drink he purchased from a vending machine at his work.According to his lawsuit, Ball claims he spat out the soda, the Madison County Record reported. He said he \u201ctook a drink, and immediately became violently ill such that he began to vomit \u2026\u00a0The contents of said can of Mountain Dew were immediately poured into a Styrofoam cup wherein a dead mouse was found,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.Ball sent the mouse to PepsiCo \u2014 along with a letter of complaint \u2014 but the oil company worker says the soda giant destroyed the body of the mouse, and therefore, his evidence.The incident happened in November 2009 and Ball [was] seeking $50,000 damages.Ball\u2019s suit led to a rather nauseating spate of articles about whether the composition of Mountain Dew would degrade or preserve the corpse of a small animal, with lawyers arguing that the beverage would rapidly dissolve a mouse\u2019s remains:Key to Pepsi\u2019s legal argument is that there\u2019s no chance a mouse\u2019s corpse could survive, intact, for 15 months swimming in Mountain Dew. While published studies have not been conducted on how rapidly Mountain Dew would dissolve a mouse, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the neon green soda can eat away teeth and bones in a matter of months, and would likely do quite a number on a rodent.\u201cI think it is plausible that it could dissolve a mouse in a few months,\u201d said Yan-Fang Ren of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who has studied the effects of citric acid on bones and teeth. \u201cBut dissolving [the mouse] does not mean it will disappear, because you\u2019ll still have the collagen and the soft tissue part. It will be like rubber.\u201dA similar claim was reported in 2011, involving the Monster brand of energy drinks. Another brand of energy drink was at the center of similar claims in 2016, when a consumer was purportedly sickened by a dead mouse in a beverage can:[Jordan] Bell started dry heaving and went straight to a doctor, who advised he go to the hospital. At the Mission Hospital they contacted BC Poison Control and told Bell that in about 24 hours he would probably experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.And in March 2018, an Arkansas Red Bull drinker reported finding a rodent at the bottom of his can. His claim went viral on Facebook, but many users were skeptical of its legitimacy:While [claimant Josh] Henley said it was not possible the rodent got inside the can when he left it in the car overnight, many people on social media said it was the highest possibility.The video, which was shared [in March 2018], went viral and was viewed more than 100,000 times and counting. It was first shared by Henley on Facebook.Some social media users also raised doubts about the legitimacy of the video.Joshua Nightingale commented: \u201cYou drank it last night, most likely that mouse got in after you drank it and went to sleep. Wouldn\u2019t you have noticed it last night after or while you were drinking it?\u201d Another comment said: \u201cIt obviously went in after you drank it.\u201dIn a statement to Mirror Online, a spokesman for Red Bull said: \u201cIt is inconceivable that a particle \u2014 let alone anything like this \u2014 could pass through the process of world-class, modern beverage manufacture.\u201dIn April 2017, beverage corporation lawyers once again argued the claims were impossible, and that the specimen was not sufficiently decomposed:[The claimant was] suing Coca-Cola for a modest amount, having medical bills related to his illness that total around $1,000, and he missed 60 hours of work. He also says that he lost thirty pounds due to his illness.Coca-Cola, however, disputes that it\u2019s possible to find such an intact mouse in one of its beverage cans. In the time that it would take for a mouse to be sealed inside a can at a bottling plant, then for the can to be distributed to a retail store and purchased, the mouse would have decomposed enough to have \u201ccompromised the can,\u201d or given off gases that would make the can bulge or burst.An attorney from Minnesota who is on the team representing Coke explained to the Mitchell Republic that the company \u201ctakes these cases extremely seriously and tries them all,\u201d since allegations of mouse contamination are damaging to its brand. Settling for a modest amount would be cheaper and easier, but the company would rather defend itself at trial \u2026 The plaintiff is seeking $2,026 and general damages, plus interest.That coverage raised two interesting aspects about dead-mouse-in-soda-can claims: that beverage companies maintain that they always take such suits to trial, and tacitly that claims of this sort seem to be somewhat common. It also appears that beverage manufacturers often feel confident rodent-in-soda claims are unlikely to hold up in court. The outlet quoted above also linked to a similar legal claim, with findings that the creature was a \u201ctoad\u201d and that no mechanism for its presence was ever determined.In 2012, however, Ball\u2019s claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and it was conditional in part on PepsiCo disclaiming responsibility. The 2009 case involving what appeared to be a toad yielded little useful information with respect to such contamination and how it might occur. At the time, a PepsiCo spokesman declined via email to speculate on how the toad got there:The FDA also conducted an investigation at the local Pepsi bottling plant in Orlando from August 4 to 11 [2009] and \u201cdid not find any adverse conditions or association to this problem,\u201d spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said.\u201cWe have not determined when or how the contamination occurred,\u201d DeLancey said in an e-mail.Pepsi says the FDA results \u201caffirmed\u201d the company\u2019s confidence \u201cin the quality of our products and the integrity of our manufacturing system,\u201d according to spokesman Jeff Dahncke.\u201cThe speed of our production lines and the rigor of our quality control systems make it virtually impossible for this type of thing to happen in a production environment. In fact, there never has been even a single instance when a claim of this nature has been traced back to a manufacturing issue \u2026\u00a0The FDA conducted a thorough inspection of our Orlando facility and found no cause for concern. In this case, the FDA simply was unable to determine when or how the specimen entered the package.\u201dWhen asked if Pepsi believed it was not responsible for the animal getting into the can, Dahncke said, \u201cWe have addressed the facts of the investigation and stated our position. It\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment beyond that.\u201dA September 2019 Facebook post claiming a user found a dead mouse in his can of Red Bull was virally popular, but neither unique in structure nor even as it pertained to Red Bull.

The history of similar allegations, often treated as urban legends or resulting in inconclusive legal outcomes, further complicates the verification of such claims. Additionally, the beverage companies consistently argue that their manufacturing processes would prevent such contamination, and without direct evidence from an investigation (like FDA findings in other cases) or a response from Red Bull confirming the incident, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim based on the information provided."}

{"claim_id":34234,"hypothesis":"A Malaysian teenager was electrocuted by earphones he was using.","date_published":"December 11, 2018","explanation_1":"We reached out to the National Electrical Contractors Association for further information from the electrical engineering aspect of the story, but they told us that not enough details about the incident were publicly available for them to be able to weigh in on the subject.","fact_checkers":"Bethania Palma","premise":"In early December 2018, the Malaysian newspaper Sinar Harian reported that a 16-year-old in Rembau, a town south of the capital of Kuala Lumpur, had been found dead by his mother. The teenager, Mohd Aidi Azzhar Zahrin had blood coming from his left ear and had been listening to music through earphones plugged into his charging cell phone. Sinar Harian stated that an autopsy had been performed and had revealed the cause of death to be electrocution. Neither Sinar Harian nor its English-language peer the New Strait Times asserted that the youngster was electrocuted by the earphones he was wearing, but that was the conclusion reached by a number of international publications, including widely-read U.S.-based Vice and Teen Vogue, both of whom aggregated the story. For example, a 9 December 2018 Vice headline read \u201cA 16-Year-Old Has Died After Being Electrocuted by His Headphones,\u201d with the text of the story stating:  Mohd is at least the fourth person this year to be killed by a headphone-inflicted electric shock. In February, 17-year-old student Luiza Pinheiro was similarly found dead on the floor of her home in Riacho Frio, Brazil after a \u201chuge electric charge\u201d surged through her phone and the headphones melted in her ears, NewsCorp reported. Indeed, reports of people dying from being electrocuted by their headphones pop up every so often, but the true causes of these deaths remain unclear. As in the case of Mohd Aidi Azzhar Zahrin, the details from news reports were not specific, and we haven\u2019t yet seen clear evidence that his earphones caused the youngster\u2019s tragic passing. A Yahoo7! news report contained a purported photograph from the scene (linked here, however we caution it is graphic). A portion of the teen\u2019s bloody face can be seen along with an earbud held aloft by a gloved hand, but the earbud appears to be undamaged (save perhaps for a small black mark). The claim that the teenager was electrocuted by the earphones he was wearing rests on a comment offered by district police chief Deputy Superintendent Anuar Bakri Abdul Salam to a local reporter, but the local versions of the story do not maintain it was the teen\u2019s earphones specifically that caused the electrocution death. The New Strait Times reported, for example, that:  Anuar Bakri said the woman then contacted a nearby clinic and a medical officer was rushed to the house. \u201cChecks showed no sign of bruises or injuries. However, there was bleeding in the boy\u2019s left ear,\u201d he said. He said the boy was believed to be wearing the headphone while the handphone was charging. \u201cThe medical officer later confirmed that the boy had died hours earlier.\u201d he said. Anuar Bakri added that a post mortem conducted at Tuanku Ja\u2019afar Hospital revealed that the cause of death to be related to electrocution. In regards to this story, we consulted a half-dozen emergency room (ER) physicians (members of the advocacy organization American College of Emergency Physicians, or ACEP), and none of them considered it likely that a person could die from an electrical shock received via earphones plugged into a cell phone, although some of them said more details about the incident were needed. None of the reports we found about the incident, for example, specified what kind of phone or earphones the teen had. Los Angeles-area ER doctor Patrick Cichon said that amperage (\u201ccurrent flow\u201d) is more lethal than voltage (\u201ccurrent potential\u201d), but both amperage and voltage are below lethal thresholds in typical earphones. Therefore, Dr. Cichon wrote, it would be \u201chighly unusual unless using defective equipment or operating outside all normal operating parameters for something like this to occur.\u201d Dr. Eric Lavonas, professor of emergency medicine and medical staff president at Denver Health, told us not enough voltage runs through such devices to cause a death as described in the viral news reports. \u201cThe plug assembly converts high voltage (in Malaysia, 220V wall outlet) into low voltage before it enters the phone. And of course the phone is only putting out low voltage to the headset,\u201d he wrote. Detroit physician Brad Uren told us he had seen the story in the wild before we contacted him, and he doubted the veracity of the reporting from get-go. For such a death to occur, he averred, it would require a number of unlikely factors to coalesce into a deadly worst-case scenario. Most phones charge at 5 volts and \u201crelatively low amperage,\u201d Uren told us via email. Even if a failure occurred at the plug or charger level, \u201cthat current would then need to travel through the phone and across the headphone plug into the ear pieces. The small circuits in a phone would probably have a hard time carrying significant current to the earpieces,\u201d he said, continuing on to state that:  I don\u2019t know of any headphones with exposed metal or conductive material, but they may exist. If non-conducting there would need to be significant sweat or salty water, etc. in the ear to conduct electricity to the body from some part of the headphone which would theoretically be energized. (Such a level of wetness would probably result in enough discomfort to cause the user to remove them before the result described.) Though true that relatively low current has been reported to cause significant injury or death, this is usually current delivered to the heart. This story described ears and head as the apparent site of injury. Seizure or respiratory arrest is possible, I suppose, assuming such a worst case scenario. As an emergency room doctor, Uren& stopped short of calling the notion impossible because \u201cI have seen some strange things in my career thus far,\u201d but he added the story that the teen died from being electrocuted by earbuds \u201cstrains credibility.\u201d","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Medical","__index_level_0__":4534,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn early December 2018, the Malaysian newspaper Sinar Harian reported that a 16-year-old in Rembau, a town south of the capital of Kuala Lumpur, had been found dead by his mother.

Neither Sinar Harian nor its English-language peer the New Strait Times asserted that the youngster was electrocuted by the earphones he was wearing, but that was the conclusion reached by a number of international publications, including widely-read U.S.-based Vice and Teen Vogue, both of whom aggregated the story. For example, a 9 December 2018 Vice headline read \u201cA 16-Year-Old Has Died After Being Electrocuted by His Headphones,\u201d with the text of the story stating:  Mohd is at least the fourth person this year to be killed by a headphone-inflicted electric shock. In February, 17-year-old student Luiza Pinheiro was similarly found dead on the floor of her home in Riacho Frio, Brazil after a \u201chuge electric charge\u201d surged through her phone and the headphones melted in her ears, NewsCorp reported. Indeed, reports of people dying from being electrocuted by their headphones pop up every so often, but the true causes of these deaths remain unclear. As in the case of Mohd Aidi Azzhar Zahrin, the details from news reports were not specific, and we haven\u2019t yet seen clear evidence that his earphones caused the youngster\u2019s tragic passing. A Yahoo7! news report contained a purported photograph from the scene (linked here, however we caution it is graphic). A portion of the teen\u2019s bloody face can be seen along with an earbud held aloft by a gloved hand, but the earbud appears to be undamaged (save perhaps for a small black mark). The claim that the teenager was electrocuted by the earphones he was wearing rests on a comment offered by district police chief Deputy Superintendent Anuar Bakri Abdul Salam to a local reporter, but the local versions of the story do not maintain it was the teen\u2019s earphones specifically that caused the electrocution death. The New Strait Times reported, for example, that:  Anuar Bakri said the woman then contacted a nearby clinic and a medical officer was rushed to the house. \u201cChecks showed no sign of bruises or injuries. However, there was bleeding in the boy\u2019s left ear,\u201d he said. He said the boy was believed to be wearing the headphone while the handphone was charging. \u201cThe medical officer later confirmed that the boy had died hours earlier.\u201d he said. Anuar Bakri added that a post mortem conducted at Tuanku Ja\u2019afar Hospital revealed that the cause of death to be related to electrocution. In regards to this story, we consulted a half-dozen emergency room (ER) physicians (members of the advocacy organization American College of Emergency Physicians, or ACEP), and none of them considered it likely that a person could die from an electrical shock received via earphones plugged into a cell phone, although some of them said more details about the incident were needed. None of the reports we found about the incident, for example, specified what kind of phone or earphones the teen had. Los Angeles-area ER doctor Patrick Cichon said that amperage (\u201ccurrent flow\u201d) is more lethal than voltage (\u201ccurrent potential\u201d), but both amperage and voltage are below lethal thresholds in typical earphones. Therefore, Dr. Cichon wrote, it would be \u201chighly unusual unless using defective equipment or operating outside all normal operating parameters for something like this to occur.\u201d Dr. Eric Lavonas, professor of emergency medicine and medical staff president at Denver Health, told us not enough voltage runs through such devices to cause a death as described in the viral news reports. \u201cThe plug assembly converts high voltage (in Malaysia, 220V wall outlet) into low voltage before it enters the phone. And of course the phone is only putting out low voltage to the headset,\u201d he wrote. Detroit physician Brad Uren told us he had seen the story in the wild before we contacted him, and he doubted the veracity of the reporting from get-go. For such a death to occur, he averred, it would require a number of unlikely factors to coalesce into a deadly worst-case scenario. Most phones charge at 5 volts and \u201crelatively low amperage,\u201d Uren told us via email. Even if a failure occurred at the plug or charger level, \u201cthat current would then need to travel through the phone and across the headphone plug into the ear pieces. The small circuits in a phone would probably have a hard time carrying significant current to the earpieces,\u201d he said, continuing on to state that:  I don\u2019t know of any headphones with exposed metal or conductive material, but they may exist. If non-conducting there would need to be significant sweat or salty water, etc. in the ear to conduct electricity to the body from some part of the headphone which would theoretically be energized. (Such a level of wetness would probably result in enough discomfort to cause the user to remove them before the result described.) Though true that relatively low current has been reported to cause significant injury or death, this is usually current delivered to the heart. This story described ears and head as the apparent site of injury. Seizure or respiratory arrest is possible, I suppose, assuming such a worst case scenario. As an emergency room doctor, Uren& stopped short of calling the notion impossible because \u201cI have seen some strange things in my career thus far,\u201d but he added the story that the teen died from being electrocuted by earbuds \u201cstrains credibility.\u201dn\nClaim: A Malaysian teenager was electrocuted by earphones he was using.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that the Malaysian teenager was electrocuted by his earphones lacks conclusive evidence. While reports state that the teenager was found with earphones in his ears connected to a charging phone, and an autopsy confirmed electrocution as the cause of death, no specific evidence directly links the earphones as the conduit for the fatal electric shock. Expert opinions suggest that the voltage and amperage typically output by a charging phone and through earphones are too low to cause electrocution, indicating that if the earphones were involved, there might have been additional contributing factors such as defective equipment. Furthermore, the initial reports and expert analyses do not provide definitive proof that the earphones themselves were the direct cause of the electrocution, leading to the conclusion that there is not enough information to confirm the claim as solely true."}

As long as the statue remains, Oriel College\u00a0and Oxford University continue to tacitly identify with\u00a0Rhodes\u2019s values, and to maintain a toxic culture of domination and oppression.

The\u00a0removal of this statue would be a welcome first step in the University\u2019s\u00a0attempt to redress the ways in which it has\u00a0been an active beneficiary of empire.

At issue is Cecil Rhodes\u2019 legacy of British imperialism in South Africa, where he served as prime minister of Cape Colony and enforced racial segregation. Rhodes was intent on \u201cpainting the map red\u201d (a term for British colonization) in Africa, and he even dreamed of reclaiming the American colonies for the British Empire, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.

But he didn't quite stay on message. Interviewer Matt Lauer began by asking Biden why the federal government wasn't closing the border between the United States and Mexico, where the outbreak began. \"\"We have contacted and been in constant contact with the leading health experts both in the world as well as here in the United States, and they have suggested that that is not the way we should move,\"\" Biden told Lauer. Lauer pressed Biden further on closing borders, saying, \"\"Let me ask this, and this is by no means a gotcha type of question, I promise. But if a member of your family came to you ...\"\" \u2014 Biden laughs here \u2014 \"\"No, Mr. Vice President, if a member of your family came to you and said, 'Look, I want to go on a commercial airliner to Mexico and back,' within the next week, would you think it's a good idea?\"\" Biden: \"\"I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that it's going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me. I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, suggesting they ride the subway. So from my perspective what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing; if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom, it's a different thing.\"\" That ended Lauer's flu questions. (His other questions were about the economy, Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch, and why Biden wasn't included among members of Obama's team named to  People  magazine's list of most beautiful people.) Within hours, Biden's spokesman sent out a statement: \"\"On the  Today Show  this morning the vice president was asked what he would tell a family member who was considering air travel to Mexico this week. The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico. If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week. As the president said just last night, every American should take the same steps you would take to prevent any other flu: keep your hands washed; cover your mouth when you cough; stay home from work if you're sick; and keep your children home from school if they're sick.\"\" We were most curious about Biden's statement that germs spread like crazy inside an airplane cabin. The Air Transport Association, an industry group that represents airlines, was none too pleased about his comments, and said they weren't true. \"\"Vice President Biden's comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,\"\" said James C. May, the group's president and CEO. \"\"The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well.

Overfelt is the executive director of the National Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Research in the Intermodal Transport Environment. The center is staffed by scientists at universities around the country who specialize in studying aircraft environment, and most of the center's funding is from the Federal Aviation Administration. Overfelt explained to us that the air in a commercial jet flows from the vents above passengers' heads to vents in the floor at their feet. That airflow sends particles down to the floor and into the aircraft's filtration system. The particles from a sneeze \"\"might travel a row or a couple of rows or something like that,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"They're really not going to travel up and down the airplane as our vice president said.\"\" \"\"Quite a bit of research indicates that,\"\" he added. And though it's not required, most commercial jets use high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove the moisture that would likely carry any viruses, Overfelt said. We were able to find a number of studies that bore out his point: \u2022 A 2002 report from the National Research Council noted that tuberculosis studies on airplanes found that infections were generally restricted to \"\"a few passengers seated close to the passenger with active tuberculosis.\"\" \u2022 A 2003 study in the  New England Journal of Medicine  on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) found that patients who became infected on airplanes were \"\"clustered in the few rows directly in front of or behind the ill passenger, rather than being randomly distributed throughout the aircraft.\"\" \u2022 A 2005 study in  The Lancet  concluded, \"\"The environmental control system used in commercial aircraft seems to restrict the spread of airborne pathogens, and the perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.\"\" That's not to say that people shouldn't worry about germs on aircraft at all, Overfelt said. But the concern should be more focused on not touching something that a sick person touched. Overfelt said that when he flies, he washes his hands frequently and tries not to touch his face, especially his nose or eyes. This is tougher on an aircraft, he said, because humidity levels tend to be lower. That means the air is dry, and that tends to irritate the eyes, which leads to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 rubbing your eyes. \"\"If someone were really worried about flying, they should take sanitizing wipes and wipe down the tray table and the arm rests and the seat-belt buckles,\"\" Overfelt said. \"\"With the hand wipes and some good common sense, people should be good to go.

Of course, we were curious, too, so we got to checking. Before we get to our findings, here's a little context about CNSNews.com for those \u2013 like us \u2013 who had not heard of it.

First, we checked the larger context of the article to see if \"\"Obamacare\"\" (the Affordable Care Act) requires health insurers to cover sterilization.

According to the U.S. Health Resource and Services Administration, services that fall under \"\"women's preventive health care\"\" are supposed to be covered for free, including mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, contraception, sexually transmitted infection counseling and \u2013 yes \u2013\"\"sterilization procedures.\"\" As for the more salient detail \u2013 the age of consent in Oregon \u2013 we found a piece of Oregon law, which states that \"\"a minor 15 years of age or older may give consent, without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor, to: Hospital care, medical or surgical diagnosis or treatment by a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board \u2026\"\"  Essentially, CNSNews.com linked those two pieces of information \u2013 the new requirements that insurance companies cover sterilization for free and the fact that Oregon's age of consent for health care is 15 years old. The idea that 15-year-old girls would be lining up for free on-demand sterilizations struck our readers either as scary - \"\"Is this true?\"\" - or ridiculous - \"\"This can't be true.\"\" We kept reporting. We checked whether sterilization had always been covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state-run health care insurance program that covers 600,000 people a month. We called Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Alissa Robbins, who confirmed that it has been included since the plan's inception in 1994. We also asked how many 15-, 16 \u2013 and 17-year-olds had received sterilizations under the plan. Robbins checked records for the last 10 years and found no sterilization procedure for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old. As for 17-year-olds, she said, at most one such procedure is performed each year, though some years none is performed. She couldn't tell us the reason, she said, because it was \"\"protected health information.\"\" However, it seems clear to us that the procedure for young women in that age bracket is exceedingly rare. Robbins also pointed us to ORS 436, which lays out the warnings and consent procedures for anyone seeking sterilization, including minors. If a physician feels a minor is not capable of making an informed consent to be sterilized, her only recourse is to go to court and ask a judge to order that she is. We also checked with OHSU Hospital to see what the process would be for a minor looking to be sterilized there. Spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley got back to us with a lengthy email. For any patient under 30, she said, the hospital offers counseling about \"\"long-acting reversible contraceptives\"\" and \"\"the risk of regret\"\" in young women who are sterilized. The \"\"most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization,\"\" she wrote, \"\"is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening.\"\" If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. \"\"(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent.\"\" She ended on this note: \"\"The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient.

The article summarizes and adds its own commentary to reports from the media and other sources about the Islamic State\u2019s poisoning of prisoners and about the group\u2019s followers potential to also poison Western grocery stores. In its About Us page, Freedom Daily said they \"\"post and decipher content to a level that is consistent with a common sense approach and falls in line with the ideals of American liberty and freedom.\"\" Its Facebook page said the website\u00a0\"\"gives Americans the real news as it unfolds with a conservative opinion.\"\" In its story, the website doesn\u2019t make any claims about active plots discovered against American supermarkets. \"\"Multiple outlets have reported that ISIS is utilizing social media to instruct members to poison food in supermarkets. It may or may not happen, but the thought of it occurring on a widespread attack on groceries could be terrorizing,\"\" said the post about the grocery stores. \"\"People could even entertain the thought of an ISIS attack before a hurricane in which the food is all poisoned and people falter in the midst of a category 4 storm before the storm even hits them. Of course, this is not something that has happened, but a mere idea or spectacle that theorists could allege.\"\" SITE Intelligence Group reported on Sept. 3 that potential terrorists were advised to inject food sold at markets with cyanide poison. SITE said that message was distributed Sept. 3 on a pro-Islamic State channel on the social media platform Telegram and that it was part of a series of information promoting \"\"lone-wolf jihad in Western countries.\"\" Freedom Daily linked to a Sept. 6 story on The Federalist Papers Project based on SITE\u2019s report. Newsweek also published a story Sept. 7 headlined, \"\"ISIS supporters call for poisoning of food in grocery stores across U.S. and Europe.\"\" But neither of them say the information came after people emptied shelves at stores as they prepared for Hurricane Irma\u2019s path across the Caribbean and Florida.

However, the evidence shows that the information about potential poisoning threats was already public before the hurricane preparations began to significantly impact grocery store inventories. The SITE Intelligence Group's report about potential terrorists being advised to poison food was published on September 3, and the photo used in the Freedom Daily story from a grocery store was taken on September 5, after the SITE report. Additionally, there is no specific evidence linking the general Muslim community to this threat; the threat was specifically from supporters of the Islamic State, which does not represent Muslims as a whole.

Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000.

It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that \"\"the word is out\"\" when in fact it was only Reid who put that \"\"word\"\" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up.\"","fact_checkers":"Louis Jacobson","premise":"\"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney\u2019s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn\u2019t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, \"\"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\"\" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, \"\"Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.\"\" Reid continued, \"\"He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,\"\" said Reid. \"\"But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? \u2026 You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.\"\" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, \"\"As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.\"\" And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, \"\"I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years.\"\" Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. \"\"Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,\"\" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, \"\"Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign.\"\" Other Republicans leaped to Romney\u2019s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that \"\"I think he\u2019s lying\"\") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a \"\"dirty liar\"\" on ABC\u2019s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times\u2019 Frank Bruni called Reid\u2019s charges part of an \"\"unbecoming, corrosive game.\"\" \"\"Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,\"\" Bruni wrote. \"\"Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That\u2019s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.\"\" Many readers asked us to put Reid\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney\u2019s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he\u2019s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it\u2019s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney\u2019s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it\u2019s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, \"\"probably not.\"\" The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it\u2019s \"\"highly unlikely\"\" that he paid nothing. \"\"It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn\u2019t taxed until sold and may never be sold,\"\" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, \"\"But Romney\u2019s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It\u2019s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.\"\" Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it\u2019s theoretically possible, it\u2019s also \"\"preposterous.\"\" \"\"Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,\"\" the article said. \"\"But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.\"\" We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. \"\"I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,\"\" White said. Our ruling Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that \"\"the word is out\"\" when in fact it was only Reid who put that \"\"word\"\" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. !\"","sources":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_162-57486998-503544\/gop-chairman-harry-reid-is-a-dirty-liar-on-romney-tax-return-issue\/, https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_162-57486520-503544\/romney-to-harry-reid-i-pay-a-lot-of-taxes\/?tag=contentMain;contentBody, http:\/\/www.mittromney.com\/learn\/mitt\/tax-return\/2011\/wmr-adr-return, http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-congress\/2012\/08\/reid-extremely-credible-source-said-romney-didnt-pay-130987.html, http:\/\/www.mittromney.com\/learn\/mitt\/tax-return\/2010\/wmr-adr-return, http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2012\/08\/01\/did_romney_pay_zero_taxes\/, https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/CREC-2012-08-02\/pdf\/CREC-2012-08-02-pt1-PgS5901-5.pdf#page=1, http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/07\/31\/harry-reid-romney-taxes_n_1724027.html, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/08\/05\/opinion\/sunday\/bruni-truculence-before-truth.html?_r=1&ref=frankbruni, http:\/\/content.usatoday.com\/communities\/onpolitics\/post\/2012\/08\/harry-reid-mitt-romney-taxes-dirty-liar-\/1, https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-soi\/12insprbulhignincome.pdf, https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-soi\/08intop400.pdf, http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2010\/02\/17\/a-look-at-the-tax-returns-of-the-top-400-taxpayers\/","label":2,"subjects":"National, Candidate Biography, Taxes, Harry Reid, ","__index_level_0__":7440,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney\u2019s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn\u2019t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, \"\"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\"\" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, \"\"Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.\"\" Reid continued, \"\"He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,\"\" said Reid. \"\"But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? \u2026 You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.\"\" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, \"\"As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.\"\" And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, \"\"I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years.\"\" Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. \"\"Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,\"\" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, \"\"Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign.\"\" Other Republicans leaped to Romney\u2019s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that \"\"I think he\u2019s lying\"\") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a \"\"dirty liar\"\" on ABC\u2019s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times\u2019 Frank Bruni called Reid\u2019s charges part of an \"\"unbecoming, corrosive game.\"\" \"\"Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,\"\" Bruni wrote. \"\"Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That\u2019s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.\"\" Many readers asked us to put Reid\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney\u2019s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he\u2019s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it\u2019s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney\u2019s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it\u2019s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, \"\"probably not.\"\" The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it\u2019s \"\"highly unlikely\"\" that he paid nothing. \"\"It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn\u2019t taxed until sold and may never be sold,\"\" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, \"\"But Romney\u2019s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It\u2019s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.\"\" Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it\u2019s theoretically possible, it\u2019s also \"\"preposterous.\"\" \"\"Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,\"\" the article said. \"\"But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.\"\" We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. \"\"I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,\"\" White said. Our ruling Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that \"\"the word is out\"\" when in fact it was only Reid who put that \"\"word\"\" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. !\"n\nClaim: Harry Reid Says Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"Harry Reid's claim that Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years is not supported by any solid evidence or credible sources. The claim is based solely on an anonymous source, and Reid himself stated he was not certain of the truth of the claim. Furthermore, tax experts and data suggest it is highly unlikely that Romney, given his income level, paid no taxes for a decade. Romney's released tax returns for 2010 and 2011 also show significant tax payments, contradicting Reid's assertion. Therefore, the claim is deemed false due to lack of evidence and substantial contradictory information."}

Haslam, schools merger and new legislation","fact_checkers":"Zack McMillin","premise":"\"Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam on whether to allow new schools merger legislation before the completion of work by Shelby County\u2019s Transition Planning Commission. Jan. 12: \"\"My sense is there is a real good-faith effort being made now to come up with the right plan, and I would like to see that play out before anything else happened legislatively.\"\" April 2: \"\"I would just love to see that commission reach the end of their work, come out with a proposal and then let the municipals make a decision. I\u2019ve felt that all along.\"\" May 8: \"\"I\u2019ve made my thoughts clear: I really did want to see the commission have a chance to get their plan out and implemented.\"\" May 9: Haslam signs into law the new state legislation paving the way for Shelby County suburban cities to hold Aug. 2 referendums to create new municipal school districts. As Shelby County awaited Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s decision on what to do when new schools legislation reached his desk, the Memphis-dominated Shelby County Board of Commissioners was already considering how it might respond legally after the bill, allowing Aug. 2 referendums on creating new municipal districts, became law. This despite the fact that Haslam had made statements all year saying he wanted the countywide schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC) to complete its work before any new legislation affecting the merger was enacted. Why the concern over creating a legal strategy to challenge the municipal districts when the governor, who had said he did not want new legislation, had the power to kill the bill with a veto? After all, the legislature had adjourned and speakers of the state House and Senate had said they would not be reconvening, not even to override a veto. But Commissioner Walter Bailey, one of the longest serving public office-holders in the state, said members of that body held little hope that Haslam would provide the veto that in essence would prevent the municipalities from creating new municipal districts before the TPC had completed its work. \"\"He indicates his feelings on one hand but I don\u2019t think his actions have been consistent,\"\" Bailey said. On May 9, Haslam signed the bill. We decided to look at whether, in so doing, the governor had effectively changed his position on whether to endorse new schools legislation before the schools merger commission had completed its work. This is our first use of the Flip-O-Meter in Tennessee, and it's important to stress this from the Flip-O-Meter description: \"\"We are not making a value judgement about flip-flopping. Some people say it shows inconsistent principles and lack of backbone. Others say it's just pragmatism and a willingness to compromise.\"\" Some background is required to understand why this is such a crucial issue for Shelby Countians. Last August, U.S. Dist. Court Judge Samuel \"\"Hardy\"\" Mays ruled that Memphis had followed proper legal procedures in surrendering the charter of its special school district. That \"\"surrender,\"\" in essence, forced consolidation of Memphis City Schools (MCS) with the suburban Shelby County Schools (SCS) system. The judge\u2019s ruling also upheld a new state law, called Public Chapter 1, that set up a transition process culminating in the final transfer MCS to the county system in time for the 2013-14 school year. Chapter 1 also included a clause saying that, upon the completion of merger in the summer of 2013, the statewide ban on municipal or special school districts could be lifted in Shelby County. It took only a few months for the suburban municipalities to put plans in motion to create municipal school districts, with the goal of opening in time for the 2013-14 school year and thus opting out of the merged system. But Haslam, who made one of the 18 appointments to the 21-member schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC), told The Commercial Appeal editorial board in January he wanted the TPC to finish its work before enacting any new legislation that would impact the process. \"\"My sense is there is a real good-faith effort being made now to come up with the right plan, and I would like to see that play out before anything else happened legislatively,\"\" Haslam said. The suburban push for rapid formation of municipal schools, however, came to a halt in early spring when Tennessee Atty. General Bob Cooper advised that no action could be taken to form municipal districts \"\"until from and after the beginning of the 2013-14 school year.\"\" But Senate majority leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, who had authored the suburban-friendly Public Chapter 1 in 2011, had already begun pushing for new legislation that would explicitly allow the suburbs to legally move forward. As Norris moved that new legislation, Haslam on April 2 reiterated his preference for letting the TPC finish its work: \"\"I would just love to see that commission reach the end of their work, come out with a proposal and then let the municipals make a decision. I\u2019ve felt that all along.\"\" TPC chairwoman Barbara Prescott, at an April meeting, said that new legislation enabling municipalities to immediately opt out of the merged system qualified as interference with the process. \"\"I believe we should be able to finish this work under the same legislation that we started,\"\" Prescott said. Norris, however, insisted the new legislation was aimed not at interfering with the process but would instead make the merger process less complicated, by allowing everyone to know on the front end whether the municipalities would or would not be part of the new district. Norris, in the final days of the legislative session, oversaw passage of a bill that, when it became law, would provide for municipal school referendums to be held on Aug. 2. That would allow municipal school board elections in November and lead to a tight but feasible process for starting up in time for the 2013-14 school year. With the legislature adjourned and the new legislation headed his way, Haslam told reporters it was unlikely he would kill the bill with a veto but again stated his position: \"\"I\u2019ve made my thoughts clear: I really did want to see the commission have a chance to get their plan out and implemented.\"\" The past tense indicated where Haslam was headed. In justifying signing the bill or allowing it to become law, Haslam suggested the TPC would be done with its work by June, just ahead of the the July 13 beginning of early voting in the Aug. 2 referendums: \"\"I think their report will be out in June and hopefully the recommendation and the vote won\u2019t be until August so there will be some window to do that. Sometimes that\u2019s just the way the timing works. In a perfect world I\u2019d love for there to be a little bit more time to consider that.\"\" On May 9, without public comment, Haslam signed the bill into law. So a key question here -- maybe the key question -- involves just when the TPC\u2019s \"\"work\"\" will be completed. This document from the TPC lays out the timeline, with different deadlines for various committees and target dates for the TPC to pull everything together. One key date does indeed come in June, as Haslam indicated. By June 14 or June 21, the TPC timeline calls for it to \"\"finalize draft plan.\"\" However, the documents show that is not the end of the process, and it assumes the \"\"draft\"\" plan will undergo significant change. Many more meetings and decisions follow, with a busy four-week \"\"comment period\"\" running from June 25 to July 20. During that comment period, the TPC would engage the public, the unified county school board and the state Department of Education for suggestions about major or minor adjustments and, on July 17, the TPC will hold a session \"\"to review and approve revisions for incorporation into plan.\"\" Another three-week comment session will follow, again including several TPC meetings, again providing for feedback from the school board and the state. On Aug. 9, the TPC would meet, make \"\"live edits to finalize plan\"\" and then, finally, vote on \u00a0\"\"final approval of plan.\"\" At that point, the plan would be submitted to the school board \"\"for up or down approval\"\" and to the state \"\"for endorsement by mid August.\"\" So there will be a \"\"draft plan\"\" by mid-June, as Haslam suggested, but the TPC\u2019s work will be far from complete. Indeed, early voting will begin four days ahead of the TPC even giving final approval to the \"\"draft plan.\"\" A final official plan will not get a vote by the full TPC until Aug. 9 -- at which point suburban municipalities will have already voted to on whether to create their own districts. And even then, the school board and state must give their approvals before it becomes final. It is understandable why Haslam, a Republican governor, would feel compelled to sign legislation strongly favored by Republican-dominated suburbs in Shelby County. It may even, as Norris contends, ultimately be the best thing for the county and the state. But, by not exercising the veto power that would have killed the bill, the governor acted contrary to his earlier\u00a0statements that\u00a0no new schools legislation should be enacted before the schools merger team had completed its work.

Apply at\u00a0disasterassistance.gov FEMA 1-800-621-3362 or 1-800-462-7585 None of these rumors was quite right, and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as Disaster-SNAP (or D-SNAP), which was\u00a0extended to parts\u00a0of Florida on 22 September 2017. D-SNAP is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps) to individuals affected by natural disasters. One does not have to be an existing recipient of SNAP benefits in order to qualify for D-SNAP, but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits. D-SNAP assistance typically lasts for one month, but Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on 22 September that the program would be in place for two months in Florida. Recipients are provided with a temporary EBT card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income. A one-person household with a gross monthly income of $1,664 or less would receive $194 in D-SNAP credit for one month (a figure that may be the source of the \u201c$197 per person\u201d claim in some Facebook rumors). An eight-person household (provided it has a gross monthly income of $4,151 or less) would be eligible to receive $1,169 in D-SNAP assistance (an average of $146 per person). A two-person household (provided it met the income requirements) would be eligible for $357 in benefits, or $179.50 per person. (There is no set benefit amount per person, a common element of the rumors which is misleading.) The extension of D-SNAP in Florida applies to certain counties. A county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours, as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered. So power outages do play a role in the provision of extended SNAP benefits, but only on the county level. Such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must have experienced a power outage for \u201cmore than two hours,\u201d or that applicants must provide photographic evidence of such outages. The appropriate place to apply for Disaster-SNAP assistance in Florida is the\u00a0ACCESS Florida web page. Other assistance is available As well as Disaster-SNAP, existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Irma. According to the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, regular Florida recipients can (as of 12 September 2017) temporarily use EBT cards to buy hot food (something they cannot normally do) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in September: USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently approved a temporary waiver and supported other actions that will help households participating in the USDA\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Florida, Georgia, and the Virgin Islands, and the Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto Rico, to access food in the wake of Hurricane Irma, including: In addition to these modifications, several types of federally-provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, both in Florida and in other states. These benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs, as well as direct assistance such as FEMA\u2019s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi-family rental properties and performing repairs, with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals. Variations in eligibility, rates of payment, duration of assistance, and type of assistance mean that it\u2019s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive. Residents of states that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance, and apply for such assistance, by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov. The claim asserted in one of the Facebook rumors, that FEMA is offering individuals $500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food, has a grain of truth to it. As part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in state where major disasters have been declared (as was the case in Florida), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what\u2019s known as Critical Needs Assistance, which consists of a one-time payment of $500, as explained by FEMA: FEMA may provide financial assistance to individuals and households who, as a result of the disaster, have immediate or critical needs because they are displaced from their primary dwelling. Immediate or critical needs are life-saving and life-sustaining items including, but not limited to: water, food, first aid, prescriptions, infant formula, diapers, consumable medical supplies, durable medical equipment, personal hygiene items, and fuel for transportation \u2026 It is a one-time $500 payment per household.

The strange appearance of the skulls coupled with the outlandish claim continues to give the story legs, and it continues to make the rounds as of mid-January 2017: The director of the Paracas Museum of History sent five samples of the Paracas skulls to undergo genetic testing, and the results were mesmerizing. The samples which consisted of hair, skin teeth and some fragments of cranial bones gave incredible details that have fueled the mystery surrounding these anomalous skulls. The genetic laboratory to where the samples were sent was not informed of the origin of the skulls in order to avoid \u2018influenced results.\u2019 Interestingly, the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, showed mutations that were unknown to any man, primate or animal found on planet Earth. The mutations present in the samples of the Paracas skulls suggest that researchers were dealing with a completely new \u2018human-like being,\u2019 very different from Homo sapiens, Neanderthals or Denisovans. The announcement in 2014 that the skulls had non-human DNA was originally promoted by Brien Foerster, a figure known for pseudoscience. As RationalWiki notes: Foerster has little in the way of relevant scientific qualifications but runs a tour company and was a regular on the very unscientific History Channel show Ancient Aliens, the museum is a private company owned by a man with no scientific qualifications, not an academic institution, and the results were announced not in a peer reviewed journal but on Facebook. Suspiciously, the geneticist who supposedly conducted the tests refused to own up and his or her identity was kept secret by Foerster. The elongated shape of the skulls is most likely due to a practice known to anthropologists called \u201cartificial cranial deformation.\u201d \u00a0This has been practiced in a\u00a0number of cultures from a wide variety of geographies, going back millennia: Experts speculate that the widespread tradition could stem from a host of motivations, not the least beauty. The latest hypothesis to join the list, however, is the belief that skull shaping could have been a boon for survival to some who practiced it, as proposed by Marta Alfonso-Durruty, an anthropologist at Kansas State University, and colleagues in a new research paper published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. The team examined 60 skulls from a group of hunter-gatherers that lived in Southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego 2,000 years ago, Hogenboom writes. Thirty percent of the skulls showed signs of intentional deformation, the first evidence that people in Patagonia practiced such modification, which could have become widespread because, like tribal tattoos or team jerseys, it promoted group cohesion. Unlike clothing, however, body modification permanently differentiates in-group members from outsiders. In Patagonia however, the hunter gatherers with modified skulls lived in more diffuse groups, created by the need to move from place to place in search off food in a resource-scarce region. Building relationships with individuals to gain access to certain areas would have been valuable. Modified skulls could have served that purpose, signaling a trusted, connected person. The Paracas skulls are on display at the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History in Lima, Peru, and were first discovered in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist, Julio Tello. They are an apparent source of interest to paranormalists who search for signs of extraterrestrial or Biblical phenomena. Some web sites put forward the claim that the skulls belong to nephilim, Biblical creatures that, according to Genesis, were the offspring of gods and human women. This is not the first time a discovery of human remains with elongated skulls sparked the hopes of UFO enthusiasts. A 2015 discovery of a prehistoric woman in Russia, at a site known as Arkaim or \u201cRussia\u2019s Stonehenge,\u201d with a similar deformity also created a buzz: Some believe that the skull\u2019s high forehead is characteristic of the so-called \u201calien grey\u201d often depicted as large-eyed and large-foreheaded beings in sci-fi films and even hoaxes. Archaeologists, though, are not convinced of the alien theory, saying that the bones belonged to a human who lived about 2,000 years ago. The scientists who shared photos of the discovery said that the body was likely from the second or third century after Christ. They also have a good explanation for the conehead skull. Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to. While both English and Spanish-language web sites have published pages of credulous stories about Foerster\u2019s \u00a0\u201cdiscovery,\u201d the Spanish-language skeptics blog Marcianitas Verdes notes: The Paracas culture was one of the ancient Andean villages that practiced skeletal modification. They wrapped\u00a0their babies\u2019 heads with rope, cloths and wooden boards in order to lengthen their skulls. This was done for spiritual or religious reasons, and scholars believe that it was an effort to look more like their deities. The web site delves into what may have caused the vague genetic abnormality supposedly found by Foerster\u2019s investigation: At best it is not conclusive. DNA was identified as human, but with abnormalities; Anomalies that could be caused by any number of contaminants or defects in the process. It could be that this DNA actually provides unusual results, but the only thing that can be said about it at this point is that it requires more study.

Archaeologists claim that the remains belonged to a woman from a 4,000 BC settlement, and the shape of the skull can be attributed to a tradition of the tribe that she belonged to. While both English and Spanish-language web sites have published pages of credulous stories about Foerster\u2019s \u00a0\u201cdiscovery,\u201d the Spanish-language skeptics blog Marcianitas Verdes notes: The Paracas culture was one of the ancient Andean villages that practiced skeletal modification. They wrapped\u00a0their babies\u2019 heads with rope, cloths and wooden boards in order to lengthen their skulls. This was done for spiritual or religious reasons, and scholars believe that it was an effort to look more like their deities. The web site delves into what may have caused the vague genetic abnormality supposedly found by Foerster\u2019s investigation: At best it is not conclusive. DNA was identified as human, but with abnormalities; Anomalies that could be caused by any number of contaminants or defects in the process. It could be that this DNA actually provides unusual results, but the only thing that can be said about it at this point is that it requires more study. The sensational launch of unconfirmed and unverifiable information like this on a radio show is not worthy of the attention this story is receiving.n\nClaim: Cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien, not human, origin.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that the cone-shaped skulls found in Latin America are of alien origin is false based on extensive evidence provided. The skulls are most likely the result of artificial cranial deformation, a practice well-documented among various cultures globally, including the Paracas culture of ancient Peru. This practice involved binding the heads of infants with ropes, cloths, and wooden boards to elongate the skull for spiritual, religious, or cultural reasons, possibly to resemble deities or promote group cohesion. The DNA anomalies cited in non-peer-reviewed claims were likely due to contaminants or errors in the genetic testing process. The lack of credible scientific backing and reliance on sources known for pseudoscience further undermines the claim of extraterrestrial origin."}

'\u201d\u00a0 The law\u00a0referenced was the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, also known as the\u00a0McCarran\u2013Walter Act. Its text is available in full at the U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services (USCIS) web site, where a preface indicates\u00a0that the law has \u201cbeen amended many times over the years but is still the basic body of immigration law.\u201d The claim typically cited \u201cChapter 2 Section 212\u201d of the Act, which excludes as ineligible for admission the following persons: In general\u00a0any alien\u00a0who a consular officer or the Attorney General knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in\u00a0any activity a purpose of which is the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means. That law, originally aimed at Communists, could be used now to exclude persons (both Muslims and non-Muslims) who have demonstrated an affiliation or sympathy with violent extremist groups professing Islamist motivations and goals (e.g., ISIS, al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram) from entering the U.S., but asserting that it enables a de facto ban on all Muslims is inaccurate. Most major religions involve basic, agreed-upon sets of tenets by\u00a0which their faithful live, and no widely-accepted understanding of Islam encompasses a prohibition on\u00a0following the laws of any country or advocates the overthrow of government. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was not without critics, among them President Harry S. Truman, who vetoed the bill on\u00a025 June 1952. In a letter titled \u201cVeto of Bill to Revise the Laws Relating to Immigration, Naturalization, and Nationality\u201d and addressed to the House of Representatives, President Truman described\u00a0the bill\u2019s provisions as both antithetical to American values and discriminatory: The greatest vice of the present quota system, however, is that it discriminates, deliberately and intentionally, against many of the peoples of the world \u2026\u00a0The desired effect [of selective admission of immigrants] was obtained\u00a0\u2026\u00a0People from such countries as Greece, or Spain, or Latvia were virtually deprived of any opportunity to come here at all, simply because Greeks or Spaniards or Latvians had not come here before 1920 in any substantial numbers. The idea behind this discriminatory policy was, to put it baldly, that Americans with English or Irish names were better people and better citizens than Americans with Italian or Greek or Polish names. It was thought that people of West European origin made better citizens than Rumanians or Yugoslavs or Ukrainians or Hungarians or Baits or Austrians. Such a concept is utterly unworthy of our traditions and our ideals. It violates the great political doctrine of the Declaration of Independence that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d It denies the humanitarian creed inscribed beneath the Statue of Liberty proclaiming to all nations, \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d It repudiates our basic religious concepts, our belief in the brotherhood of man, and in the words of St. Paul that \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free \u2026. for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d In that letter President Truman\u00a0further maintained the act\u2019s provisions were out of alignment with foreign policy goals, inhibiting immigrants who needed it most from seeking safe harbor in America: The basis of this quota system was false and unworthy in 1924. It is even worse now. At the present time, this quota system keeps out the very people we want to bring in. It is incredible to me that, in this year of 1952, we should again be enacting into law such a slur on the patriotism, the capacity, and the decency of a large part of our citizenry. Today, we have entered into an alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty, with Italy, Greece, and Turkey against one of the most terrible threats mankind has ever faced. We are asking them to join with us in protecting the peace of the world. We are helping them to build their defenses, and train their men, in the common cause. But, through this bill we say to their people: You are less worthy to come to this country than Englishmen or Irishmen; you Italians, who need to find homes abroad in the hundreds of thousands \u2014 you shall have a quota of 5,645; you Greeks, struggling to assist the helpless victims of a communist civil war \u2014 you shall have a quota of 308; and you Turks, you are brave defenders of the Eastern flank, but you shall have a quota of only 225! Truman\u2019s words seemed exceptionally prescient when he spoke of citizens in countries that had in recent years fallen behind the Iron Curtain: Today, we are \u201cprotecting\u201d ourselves, as we were in 1924, against being flooded by immigrants from Eastern Europe. This is fantastic. The countries of Eastern Europe have fallen under the communist yoke \u2014 they are silenced, fenced off by barbed wire and minefields \u2014 no one passes their borders but at the risk of his life. We do not need to be protected against immigrants from these countries \u2014 on the contrary we want to stretch out a helping hand, to save those who have managed to flee into Western Europe, to succor those who are brave enough to escape from barbarism, to welcome and restore them against the day when their countries will, as we hope, be free again \u2026\u00a0some 30,000 Rumanians, who have managed to escape the labor camps and the mass deportations of their Soviet masters, have asked our help. These are only a few examples of the absurdity, the cruelty of carrying over into this year of 1952 the isolationist limitations of our 1924 law. In that letter, President Truman spoke specifically of immigration quotas arranged deliberately to exclude specific nationalities. A large portion of the letter directly addressed Truman\u2019s belief that the American way of life ought to be extended to those living under the same totalitarian regimes the U.S. hoped to vanquish.

These wipes were distributed by Nutek prior to October 21, 2014 to the following retail stores: Walgreens, Sam\u2019s Club, Family Dollar, Fred\u2019s, and Diapers.com. After receiving a small number of complaints of odor and discoloration, Nutek conducted microbial testing that showed the presence of a bacteria, called Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia), in some of these products. Soon after, on October 3, 2014 the company initiated a voluntary withdrawal of lots that had tested positive for the bacteria, as well as other baby wipes in the surrounding time frame. After some additional lots were tested, as a precautionary measure, Nutek believed it was a prudent decision to withdraw all its baby wipe products. On Twitter, Sam\u2019s Club (a retailer mentioned prominently in the claim) repeatedly promoted baby wipes in February 2017. No mention of any sort of recall was made in 2017 or 2016 by the account; in 2015, the brand advised a customer that there was no baby wipes recall: @SarahRaphael At this moment there is no active recall for Member\u2019s Mark baby wipes. Thank you for asking and have a great day! \u2014 Sam\u2019s Club (@SamsClub) July 10, 2015  The Consumer Product Safety Commission did not\u00a0have any January 2017 wipes recall notices on its site. A wipe warmer was recalled in August 2016, but the notices were clearly unrelated to the claim of a January 2017 baby wipes recall.n\nClaim: Several brands of baby wipes available in the U.S. were recalled in 2017 because they pose a risk of serious infection.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence provided indicates that the claim of a baby wipes recall in January 2017 due to a risk of serious infection is false. The details described in the claim closely match an earlier incident from October 2014 when Nutek Disposables, Inc. did initiate a recall of baby wipes due to contamination with Burkholderia cepacia. However, there are no records or announcements from reputable sources such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the FDA, or Sam's Club's Twitter account about a recall in January 2017. This discrepancy suggests that the website falsely reported an event that actually occurred in 2014, not 2017."}

A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It\u2019s another thing to say what state Rep. William \"\"Billy\"\" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. \"\"There are 250,000 rivers in this country,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina.\"\" He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically \"\"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are the \"\"most polluted\"\" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. \"\"There are so many things that \u2018pollute\u2019 our rivers \u2014 GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,\"\" Raabe said. \"\"The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity.\"\" Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. \"\"The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,\"\" Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn\u2019t have a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) \"\"does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,\"\" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with \u2013 including the\u00a0Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA \u2013\u00a0echoed Raabe in saying it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina\u00a0Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. \"\"Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends,\"\" Marraccini wrote in an email. Through Google searches, PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the \"\"top five most polluted.\"\" Our ruling Richardson said that N.C. is home to two of the \"\"top five\"\" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers \"\"most endangered\"\" list \u2013 but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim. There\u2019s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms\u00a0but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate.

Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America\u2019s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this \"\"most polluted rivers\"\" list he alludes to? We\u2019ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river \u2014 and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill\u2019s effects. But they\u2019re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ\u2019s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ\u2019s leader says the department doesn\u2019t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five \"\"most polluted\"\" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization\u2019s annual \"\"America\u2019s most endangered rivers\"\" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might\u2019ve misspoke but that he \"\"cares deeply\"\" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once\u00a0saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument \u2013 but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. \"\"My intention was not to mislead anyone,\"\" Richardson said. \"\"Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it\u2019s clear we\u2019ve got a huge issue that we\u2019re not dealing with.\"\" Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their \"\"most endangered\"\" list shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: \"\"This report is not a list of the nation\u2019s 'worst'\u00a0or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future.\"\" \"\"The big difference between \u2019most polluted\u2019 and \u2018most endangered\u2019 is that when we list a river as \u2018most endangered\u2019 it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river,\"\" said Peter Raabe, the group\u2019s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group\u2019s \"\"most endangered\"\" report doesn\u2019t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins \"\"have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers,\"\" the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically \"\"partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers.\"\" The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there\u2019d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are the \"\"most polluted\"\" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. \"\"There are so many things that \u2018pollute\u2019 our rivers \u2014 GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.,\"\" Raabe said. \"\"The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity.\"\" Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. \"\"The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for,\"\" Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn\u2019t have a \"\"most polluted\"\" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) \"\"does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers,\"\" spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with \u2013 including the\u00a0Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA \u2013\u00a0echoed Raabe in saying it\u2019s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina\u00a0Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. \"\"Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends,\"\" Marraccini wrote in an email. Through Google searches, PolitiFact couldn\u2019t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the \"\"top five most polluted.\"\" Our ruling Richardson said that N.C. is home to two of the \"\"top five\"\" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers \"\"most endangered\"\" list \u2013 but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim. There\u2019s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms\u00a0but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate. However, PolitiFact found no basis for Richardson\u2019s claim that North Carolina rivers rank among the top five most polluted in the United States.\"n\nClaim: \"North Carolina is home to\u00a0\"\"two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers\"\" in the U.S.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The claim made by state Rep. William 'Billy' Richardson that North Carolina has 'two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers' in the U.S. is not supported by reputable sources or data. The American Rivers organization, which Richardson referenced, does not provide a 'most polluted' list but rather a 'most endangered' list, where the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers are ranked seventh, not in the top five. Additionally, PolitiFact's investigation found no comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that ranks either river among the top five most polluted in the nation. Furthermore, environmental experts and agencies like the EPA confirm the difficulty in ranking rivers by pollution levels due to the complexity and variety of pollution types."}

In a piece for the Huffington Post, Jana Schmiedling of the \u201cWoman of Size\u201d podcast says that she mostly enjoyed her experience at the theme park until a dark cloud descended upon her day when she attempted to participate in the \u201cHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey\u201d ride. The story is based on a 9 May 2018\u00a0opinion piece written by Schmiedling about her experience while visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Hollywood, a movie-themed amusement park in Los Angeles. She recounts getting kicked off the \u201cHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey\u201d ride due to her size after making it as far as sitting down and lowering the shoulder harness: One of the 20-something ride managers walked over and asked us all to step off because of a \u201csafety\u201d issue. We were ushered through a door to what looked like a backstage area where another 20-something employee rattled off a spiel about \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cthree clicks\u201d and having to \u201ctry out a safety seat.\u201d That\u2019s when we all knew that I hadn\u2019t actually made it onto the Hogwarts ride.

Schmiedling was simply recounting her experience with a known issue\u00a0at amusement parks, in which plus-sized guests will sometimes wait in line and finally get their chance to board a ride, only to be told by park employees that they do not meet size restrictions. The predicament is usually compounded by the mortification resulting from having it happen in full view of other park guests. Schmiedling argues that the experience is emblematic of the ways in which some are bullied or excluded because they don\u2019t conform to socially-dictated weight norms and that theme parks, places where people spend a great deal of money to escape their day-to-day struggles and conflicts, should build attractions that accommodate guests of all sizes and body types\u00a0\u2014 a seemingly innocuous, if not benevolent, suggestion. She writes: Because Harry Potter is fantastical \u2015 beyond reality \u2015 the park experience should also transcend the fat-shaming that we encounter every time we leave our homes. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter needs to open its doors to all kinds of people with all kinds of bodies who experience life in all kinds of ways and who would be so delighted to be invited into its magical realm. Right now, it\u2019s just a little too realistic. However the piece was, perhaps predictably, picked up by right-leaning blogs throwing red meat to fans hungry for manufactured outrage about outspoken women or overly-sensitive \u201csocial justice warriors.\u201d Aside from DailyWire.com, the article was aggregated by\u00a0DailyCaller.com,\u00a0Breitbart.com and the conspiratorial site WND.com, which published headlines like, \u201cWoman Says Harry Potter Ride \u2018Fat Shamed\u2019 Her.\u201d As is often the case when the Internet outrage machine churns into motion,\u00a0Schmiedling said she is getting aggressively harassed in response to her piece, telling us: Yes I\u2019ve definitely been trolled about the article and it only informs me that we have a long way to go in our conversation around body justice. Schmiedling\u2019s experience with that particular attraction isn\u2019t unique\u00a0\u2014 there have been multiple reports that the Forbidden Journey ride has more restrictive limitations on the size of guests than others. As the theme park-oriented\u00a0Attractions Magazine reported, it may be in part because, unlike roller coasters, the ride doesn\u2019t go fast enough for the force of motion to help secure people in seats: Forbidden Journey isn\u2019t a roller coaster, it\u2019s a new type of ride in which the seats are on the end of a robotic arm, which moves along a track. [\u2026] Are the seats more snug to better hold the guests in, or is it used as a built-in weight limit? The ride doesn\u2019t have any inversions like the roller coasters mentioned do, but it also doesn\u2019t have the forward momentum to hold guests in their seats either. Maybe since the ride is still in technical rehearsals, the seats will be adjusted to allow larger guests, but there\u2019s no indication that is the case. If you\u2019re worried you may not fit in the seats, there are special test seats outside Hogwarts and just before you get on the ride. The seats must click three times or you can\u2019t ride. Banks was able to get two clicks with the help of a strong \u201cwizard\u201d working the attraction. Nevertheless, Schmiedling, a comedian who hosts a podcast called \u201cWoman of Size,\u201d wrote that were it not for a warning from a friend about the ride\u2019s weight restrictiveness and the fact she spends a lot of time discussing societally-prescribed weight norms and their effect on people who don\u2019t conform to them, the experience may have been far more painful: As disappointed as I was, the experience didn\u2019t entirely ruin my day. But I wonder how I would have reacted had I not already built up a small community of women in comedy dealing with similar body discrimination. Ruha did me a great service by warning me, but if I hadn\u2019t been producing my podcast and discussing these issues weekly and meeting like-minded people, rejection from the Hogwarts ride because of my size would still have been a humiliating shock.

In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.\"\" Fields stood by her account of what happened in a March 14 interview with Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly. \"\"This is a campaign that continues to lie,\"\" she said. \"\"I never wanted it to get this way. Those bruises will heal. My problem is the smearing of my name, my reputation.\"\" Following the incident, Breitbart editor-at-large Joel Pollak published a report where he questioned whether it was actually Lewandowski who grabbed Fields rather than another man. Claiming Breitbart was standing with the Trump campaign instead of its own employees, Fields and several other Breitbart employees resigned. Since the security footage came out in the past couple days, though, Pollak has admitted that his report was incorrect. Trump, conversely, said the footage \"\"exonerates\"\" Lewandowski \"\"totally.\"\" It doesn\u2019t; it looks from the video as if he did grab her \u2014 and the police report says the video is consistent with what Fields\u00a0alleged. Trump also criticized Fields for allegedly grabbing him to ask a question and for holding a pen. While somewhat expected for a reporter to have a pen handy, Trump said it could have been a \"\"little bomb\"\" or a knife. Our ruling Trump said that when Michelle Fields \"\"found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.\"\" We see no evidence that Fields\u2019 story about her altercation with Trump\u2019s campaign manager has changed.

Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Fields' story changed after the security footage emerged is contradicted by the consistent statements given by Fields and reported by various sources."}

We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke.

{"claim_id":9555,"hypothesis":"Botox Works As Well As Nerve Stimulator for Incontinence - Study","date_published":"October 10, 2016","explanation_1":"This news story\u00a0covers\u00a0a clinical trial that compared two different treatments for severe urinary urge incontinence in women. One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves. The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study\u2019s findings\u00a0(such as the\u00a0researchers\u2019 conclusions that\u00a0the results are of \u201cuncertain clinical importance\u201d). It also attempts to discuss cost, but provides no prices, and doesn\u2019t go far enough in detailing the potential harms of either treatment. And, because\u00a0the story\u2019s only interviewed\u00a0source has\u00a0potential conflicts of interest,\u00a0independent scrutiny was needed. Urinary incontinence is common, affecting millions of individuals, both women and men. The prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal result of aging. The condition is more prevalent in women, though beyond the age of 80, both men and women reportedly have similar rates. The kind of incontinence studied here\u2013\u201csevere refractory urge incontinence\u201d\u2013specifically means a person has an abnormally frequent urge to urinate, and it is\u00a0resistant to standard treatments.","fact_checkers":"Dave Mosher,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Joy Victory","premise":"We hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day.

Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com.

The story would have benefited greatly from at least one source who isn\u2019t involved in the cognitive-enhancement movement. It does a better job of describing the availability of these supplements and the hyper-competitive culture that feeds this emerging market. The term \u201cnootropics\u201d applies to a wide variety of substances that apparently require no safety or efficacy trials, no FDA approval, and no prescription from a doctor. As a result, media coverage is often consumers\u2019 only tool to counter the marketing hype when attempting to determine whether these products will do them good or harm, or simply waste their money. Sadly critical coverage is in short supply. Back in 2015, HealthNewsReview.org Associate Editor Kathlyn Stone wrote that nootropics were \u201cunder the radar\u201d of journalists, despite heavy marketing targeted at students and young professionals. That appears to be changing, but journalists need to be cognizant of their role as consumer watchdogs.","fact_checkers":"Mary Chris Jaklevic,Steven J.

For those seeking a cocktail of supposed brain boosters, startup Nootrobox charges $135 for \u201call the nootropics you need to enhance your cognitive state for one month.\u201d The company explains: \u201cCognitive performance is an active, long-term investment.\u201d (Notably, piracetam isn\u2019t on Nootrobox\u2019s ingredient list. For more on that, read the section on availability.) The story doesn\u2019t quantify any known benefits of these brain enhancers, for example if memory increased by a certain percent. Harms are addressed\u2013enough to be Satisfactory for this criteria. But the discussion is confusing. The story initially says nootropics have \u201csupposedly few side effects and low toxicity.\u201d Later it states: As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d In contrast, consider these unequivocal cautions in a similar Mercury News story last fall, starting in the seventh paragraph: Research into the cognitive benefits of nootropics is still in its early stages, and some experts worry about the long-term health effects of ingesting potent synthetic smart drugs, which are largely unregulated. Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said. This story falls into the trap of relying on positive anecdotes as evidence, citing an entrepreneur who \u201ccredits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees,\u201d as well as a physician who said he with experimented with piracetam and found it \u201chelpful.\u201d Also troublesome is this statement: \u201cPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities.\u201d\u00a0 Saying it\u2019s \u201cwell studied\u201d in the same sentence as giving purported benefits is confusing and may lead readers to assume incorrectly that these benefits were proven in studies.

The story lacks comment from an independent expert who\u2019s not involved with selling, prescribing or taking nootropics or some other cognition-boosting product. The story doesn\u2019t address proven strategies to improve mental skills such as good nutrition, adequate sleep, social engagement, cognitively challenging activities, and exercise. The story does a good job here, although it injects confusion when it states that in the U.S. piracetam \u201ccan be sold only for research purposes,\u201d but later says that piracetam and similar drugs are available online. In fact, the FDA at least twice warned suppliers, in 2010 and 2012, that piracetam was classified as a drug and could not be sold as a supplement. According to online accounts, that FDA action prompted major retailers to stop carrying it, which could explain why it\u2019s not present in some products marketed as nootropics. The story also states: \u201cA number of companies now market nootropic \u2018stacks,\u2019 or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\u201d There story gives perspective, mentioning that piracetam has been around for decades, though newer formulations are on the market, and that companies have recently begun marketing \u201cstacks\u201d with multiple supplements. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","sources":"https:\/\/www.healthnewsreview.org\/2015\/12\/flying-under-journalists-radars-brain-enhancing-supplements-dubbed-nootropics\/","label":3,"subjects":"neurology,smart drugs","__index_level_0__":5579,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThere\u2019s no discussion of cost. We found one drug cited in this story \u2014 piracetam \u2014 online for $39.99 for 180 capsules. For those seeking a cocktail of supposed brain boosters, startup Nootrobox charges $135 for \u201call the nootropics you need to enhance your cognitive state for one month.\u201d The company explains: \u201cCognitive performance is an active, long-term investment.\u201d (Notably, piracetam isn\u2019t on Nootrobox\u2019s ingredient list.

Harms are addressed\u2013enough to be Satisfactory for this criteria. But the discussion is confusing.

Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said.

We searched that particular issue, and Trump appeared on the November 9, 1992 cover under the text: \u201cFighting Back, Trump Scrambles Off the Canvas.\u201dOn page 41 of the issue, what appears to be a paraphrase by author Julie Baumgold appeared:The final paragraph above appeared to be the author\u2019s paraphrasing of Trump\u2019s sentiments\u00a0toward women he perceived as seeking attention (even negative attention) from powerful men:[Trump\u2019s] contempt for beautiful women who like to be abused is boundless, and he is full of stories of supermodels, women he might call twelves (not their size), clinging to a rockstar\u2019s legs and the rock star kicking them away.

[Quotation.] Women are two types for him \u2014 those of use, and those he beds, or \u201csacks,\u201d and, of the two, the former probably get more of his heart.That excerpt featured the author\u2019s\u00a0characterization\u00a0of Trump in the profile, based on the writer\u2019s personal observations. In that appearance, the quote is part of a pastiche of commentary made by Trump himself and descriptors appended by that journalist, such as the \u201ctwo types of women\u201d commentary.However, the quote appears a second time on page 43 of the same issue, that time in a different context. Philip Johnson, the individual referenced, is a noted architect\u00a0who worked on Trump\u2019s casino around the period the article was published:In the screenshot above, the second appearance of the quotation appears in the second complete paragraph on the left. It appears to represent half of a conversation, the other half to which readers were not privy. It begins with a setting (the \u201cearly-morning hours\u201d and a \u201ccasino floor\u201d), and the relevant part begins:Philip Johnson looks at his watch. He is going to Berlin this evening to design a building at Checkpoint Charlie. Trump is talking about women and says \u201cYou have to treat \u2019em like s\u2014.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d make a good mafioso,\u201d says Johnson.\u201cOne of the greatest,\u201d says Donald as the car glides through the protected pinelands into the corrupted city.Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson. Tyson told Trump the woman who put him in jail \u201cwanted it real bad.\u201d Trump feels Tyson is doing time on a bad rap: \u201cShe knocked on his door at 1 AM and was up and dancing at eight the next morning.\u201d This speech is another of the set pieces he is so fond of delivering. When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and community service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice to him for the first time in his 46 years.Based on the format of the article, which jumped around and featured quotes without preceding context, Donald Trump may have been more broadly voicing his negative opinion of a woman who accused boxer Mike Tyson of rape in the early 1990s. Tyson was convicted and jailed in February 1992; the boxer was imprisoned when the Trump profile ran in November of that year.From the context, it was difficult to discern whether Trump\u2019s \u201cyou\u00a0have to treat \u2019em like shit\u201d comment was spoken outside the context of Tyson, as part of his distaste for the decision to convict his friend, or in some other context not provided.However, the citation on page 41 provided the quote in paraphrase form, in a broader characterization of Trump\u2019s commentary\u00a0about powerful men and the bad behavior women \u201callowed\u201d them to indulge in. Additionally confusing was that a nearly exact version of the phrase was presented as a direct quote attributed to Trump two pages later. In that portion, the writer claims Trump was \u201ctalking about women\u201d and said \u201cyou have to treat \u2019em like [shit. ]\u201dTrump denied making the remarks in any context in a 2016\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0interview:[Interviewer]: Let\u2019s talk about women. Your feelings toward them seem conflicted, even chauvinistic, confusing since you adore and respect your mother so much. [Trump]: I have great relationships with women, my mother, Ivana, Marla, my female executives are better than the men: tougher, smarter. [Interviewer]: So why in 1992 did you tell a writer for New York magazine, Marie Brenner, that \u2018You have to treat women like shit\u201d \u2014 ultimately pouring a bottle of wine down her back? [Trump]: I didn\u2019t say that. The woman\u2019s a liar, extremely unattractive, lots of problems because of her looks. [Interviewer]: That statement is exactly why women think you\u2019re a chauvinist pig. [Trump]: They\u2019re right \u2014 and not. People say, \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d but there\u2019s a truth in it, in a modified form. Psychologists will tell you that some women want to be treated with respect, others differently. I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, \u201cBe rougher and you\u2019ll see a different relationship.\u2019 Unfortunately, with people in general, you get more with vinegar than honey.That interview mentions Marie Brenner, a\u00a0Vanity Fair writer who profiled Trump in 1991; Brenner accused Trump of pouring wine on her because he was displeased about something she\u2019d written. The interview appeared to conflate Brenner, upon whom Trump had purportedly poured wine, and Baumgold, author of the 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.Confusion may have also stemmed from what appeared to be the first post-candidacy appearance of the claim via The Daily Beast in 2015, which mentioned both the wine claim as well as the quote from a conversation with Johnson. In March 2016, the quote in it\u2019s \u201cwomen, you have to \u2026\u201d form appeared in an attack ad.According to Baumgold, Trump was talking about women when he made the remarks, but their complete context did not appear in the piece. \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d presented a modified version of the quote, attributing the phrase to Trump as such: \u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d Although Baumgold broadly reported Trump was speaking about women when he said \u201cyou have to treat them like [shit],\u201d the complete context of the quote was missing.","sources":"https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-this-the-newest-and-clearest-photo-of-pluto\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Did+Donald+Trump+Say+%27Women%2C+You+Have+to+Treat+Them+Like+S---%27+in+a+1992+Interview%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA41&vq=%22babes%20are%20bad%22&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q=%22you%20have%20to%20treat%20them%20like%20s%22&f=false, https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/vb8pq3\/women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit-new-ad-highlights-trumps-statements-on-women, https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/you-have-to-treat-em-like-shit-before-megyn-kelly-trump-dumped-wine-on-a-female-reporter, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/donald-trump-women-unearthed-1994-primetime-interview-nancy-collins-938176, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OccupyDemocrats\/posts\/3042002795892754, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/archive.fo\/BeEY2, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/boxing-legend-convicted-of-raping-beauty-queen, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-upper-case-and-lower-case-originally-refer-to-where-printers-kept-their-letters\/, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&q=%22babes+are+bad%22#v=onepage&q=mafioso&f=false, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/tag\/occupy-democrats\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-an-arkansas-republican-propose-cutting-free-lunches-to-punish-students\/, https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/frontline\/interview\/marie-brenner\/, https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/dept-of-design\/philip-johnson-the-man-who-made-architecture-amoral, https:\/\/hoax-alert.leadstories.com\/3470895-fake-news-donald-trump-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit.html","label":3,"subjects":"Disinformation, Fact Checks","__index_level_0__":4178,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn September 14 2019 the popular \u2014 but not always accurate \u2014 Facebook page \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d shared a Donald Trump quote meme\u00a0(archived here), alleging that the President said \u201cwomen, you have to treat them like shit\u201d in a 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.To the right of an image of President Trump, text stated:\u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, 1992,\u00a0New York MagazineThis is an ACTUAL Trump quote, AND THE PART OF \u201cFAMILY VALUES\u201d COULDN\u2019T CARE LESS!The meme\u2019s claim was presented in the second part of the text, that \u201cyou have to treat [women] like shit\u201d was an \u201cactual Trump quote.\u201d The group helpfully provided a specific citation window, namely a 1992 article in\u00a0New York Magazine.As our friends at Lead Stories pointed out,\u00a0New York Magazine\u2018s archives from 1992 were searchable on Google Books.

Fact: Barack Obama will protect your guaranteed benefits and will not allow Medicare to become a voucher program. Fact: Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits and instead give future retirees \u2018premium support\u2019 or vouchers. AARP opposes that plan and non-partisan analysts say it could raise seniors' costs up to $6,400 a year.\"\" But are there \"\"guaranteed benefits\"\" for Medicare today? And if so, would they be at risk if Romney wins? A lot of it depends on how you define these words. What guarantees exist under Medicare today? Probably the clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked. That wasn\u2019t always the case. Before Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965, health coverage for seniors was far from guaranteed. When people retired, they often lost coverage they had from their former employer and couldn\u2019t afford a new plan. (For more on the pre-Medicare era, including statistics, see our article, \"\"Were the early 1960s a golden age for health care?\"\") The Obama campaign goes further. It argues that \"\"guaranteed benefits\"\" refers to \"\"all the benefits that Medicare is required to cover.\"\" Today, Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting one\u2019s benefits depend on the amount of money they paid into the system. \"\"As a system of defined benefits, Medicare does guarantee those benefits,\"\" said Paul Starr, a specialist on health care reform at Princeton University. \"\"The government has a responsibility for them that it would not have in a defined-contribution scheme. There are a host of legal rights in regard to providers that are also associated with those guaranteed benefits. All that goes away with the shift to defined contribution.\"\" Is there a complete guarantee of benefits? No, Medicare benefits aren\u2019t guaranteed in every sense. First, while the federal government guarantees that you will be served by Medicare once you turn 65, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll get every possible service or treatment paid for. Indeed, an entire industry sector -- Medigap insurance plans -- has emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover. This is particularly true for the coverage for newly emergent technologies and treatments. And just because something is covered today doesn\u2019t mean it will be covered indefinitely, or at the same percentage of the cost. Congress and the president can -- and do -- change the benefit rules for Medicare. In 1988, for example, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, adding a bevy of benefits, including a prescription drug benefit and a catastrophic-care benefit, said Robert Moffit, a health care specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The following year, Congress repealed it. Obama\u2019s own health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, doesn\u2019t maintain the status quo indefinitely. While we have previously said that the Romney campaign is exaggerating when it criticizes Obama for cutting Medicare, the Romney campaign isn\u2019t wrong that changesare going to be made. The fact that Obama would reduce Medicare reimbursement to certain Medicare providers -- likely resulting in the elimination or reduction of some benefits -- is proof positive that Medicare is not a fixed, unchangeable program. Obama\u2019s law also creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member, appointed panel that is charged with identifying Medicare savings. While PolitiFact has in the past been critical of Republican exaggerations about what the board would do, the board could force certain changes in the Medicare program. Any such future changes would undermine the notion that Medicare has \"\"guaranteed benefits.\"\" \"\"If you are promised a benefit but find trouble accessing physicians or home care or long-term-care providers to provide that service, have your benefits been changed or compromised?\"\" said Gail Wilensky, a former health care official under President George H.W. Bush. \"\"I think a reasonable person could say yes.\"\" Another important factor that could infringe on any Medicare \"\"guarantee\"\" is the program\u2019s fiscal challenges. According to Medicare\u2019s actuary, the trust fund for Medicare Part A -- the part of the program that pays for hospital care -- will run out in 2024 if the Obama law\u2019s cuts remain on the books, or in 2016 if the cuts are rescinded (the course Romney has said he wants to follow). So unless something is done to change the program\u2019s fiscal balance, Medicare would spend down its reserves for hospital payments within eight to 16 years. \"\"If you define guarantee benefit as simply receiving a Medicare card, then that only lasts until the money runs out,\"\" said Joshua Archambault, a former Romney aide who is now a health care policy specialist at the free-market Pioneer Institute. \"\"So I guess the president can make that claim until 2016 \u2026 but then he loses it.\"\" Even health care experts who are supportive of Obama\u2019s law do acknowledge that the concept of a Medicare \"\"guarantee\"\" may be too strongly worded. \"\"So long as the law is in place, people who meet specified eligibility requirements are assured specified benefits,\"\" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Still, \"\"nothing in the statutes is \u2018guaranteed,\u2019 because Congress always has the option of changing the law.\"\" Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has advised both Obama and Romney on health care reform, agreed. \"\"Under today's system, you have a guaranteed benefit, but one that is subject to political risk,\"\" he said. How Romney would change Medicare As for Romney\u2019s plan, it\u2019s important to note that it has not been been set out in full detail, and it hasn\u2019t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. But we\u2019ll explain it as best we can. Romney has said his plan would be close to the most recent one offered by his running mate, Paul Ryan. For people who are now under age 55, Medicare would no longer pay for seniors\u2019 health care bills directly. Instead, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available. We know that the Romney plan, like the status quo, would preserve the guarantee that people will start receiving coverage under a federal health care program when they turn 65. (The age threshold would gradually rise to 67 by 2034.) Less clear is whether the operational changes Romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under Medicare. The Romney campaign argues that not only would be traditional Medicare be a choice, but that private plan offerings must provide coverage at least comparable to what Medicare provides today, and that those plans would be Medicare-approved. However, since CBO hasn\u2019t weighed in, we don\u2019t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, especially over the longer term. The Obama campaign argues that \"\"Romney has said that under his voucher system, plans have to offer coverage that is \u2018comparable\u2019 to Medicare today\"\" -- a term they believe falls short of a guarantee of specific benefits. But Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health-care issues for President George W. Bush, says that\u2019s a smokescreen. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \"\"establishes the benefits covered by Medicare each year, and the private insurers in Medicare Advantage and Part D, the drug benefit, are required to cover at least that minimum benefit or its actuarial equivalent. That's exactly the Romney proposal.\"\" Under the most recent plan, Levin said, \"\"seniors are guaranteed at least one and generally two options that provide comprehensive coverage for no greater out-of-pocket costs than they have now.\"\" Levin also disputes the notion that the Romney plan is a pure defined-contribution plan. \"\"The Romney approach is a hybrid of defined benefit and defined contribution,\"\" he said. \"\"The minimum benefit is set by the government, and all competing insurers must meet it, but the government payment is determined by competitive bidding among those insurers to see how cheaply they can provide at least that minimum benefit.\"\" The most recent Republican plans have lessened the likelihood that Medicare\u2019s payment will fall behind the actual rise in health care costs, experts say, but given the limited details, there\u2019s still some uncertainty on this front. Under the Romney plan, MIT\u2019s Gruber said, you have the same political risk of a broken guarantee as you have today, but that guarantee is compounded by health spending risk. \"\"As health spending rises faster than your voucher, you are in trouble,\"\" he said. Our ruling In the ad, Obama said he \"\"will protect your guaranteed benefits\"\" in Medicare, while \"\"Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits.\"\" Obama exaggerates when he refers to \"\"guaranteed\"\" Medicare benefits under today\u2019s system. Currently, Medicare does \"\"guarantee\"\" a form of health coverage for seniors and, in the shorter term, guarantees specific benefits.

First, while the federal government guarantees that you will be served by Medicare once you turn 65, it doesn\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll get every possible service or treatment paid for. Indeed, an entire industry sector -- Medigap insurance plans -- has emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover. This is particularly true for the coverage for newly emergent technologies and treatments. And just because something is covered today doesn\u2019t mean it will be covered indefinitely, or at the same percentage of the cost. Congress and the president can -- and do -- change the benefit rules for Medicare. In 1988, for example, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, adding a bevy of benefits, including a prescription drug benefit and a catastrophic-care benefit, said Robert Moffit, a health care specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The following year, Congress repealed it. Obama\u2019s own health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, doesn\u2019t maintain the status quo indefinitely. While we have previously said that the Romney campaign is exaggerating when it criticizes Obama for cutting Medicare, the Romney campaign isn\u2019t wrong that changesare going to be made. The fact that Obama would reduce Medicare reimbursement to certain Medicare providers -- likely resulting in the elimination or reduction of some benefits -- is proof positive that Medicare is not a fixed, unchangeable program. Obama\u2019s law also creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member, appointed panel that is charged with identifying Medicare savings. While PolitiFact has in the past been critical of Republican exaggerations about what the board would do, the board could force certain changes in the Medicare program. Any such future changes would undermine the notion that Medicare has \"\"guaranteed benefits.\"\" \"\"If you are promised a benefit but find trouble accessing physicians or home care or long-term-care providers to provide that service, have your benefits been changed or compromised?\"\" said Gail Wilensky, a former health care official under President George H.W. Bush. \"\"I think a reasonable person could say yes.\"\" Another important factor that could infringe on any Medicare \"\"guarantee\"\" is the program\u2019s fiscal challenges. According to Medicare\u2019s actuary, the trust fund for Medicare Part A -- the part of the program that pays for hospital care -- will run out in 2024 if the Obama law\u2019s cuts remain on the books, or in 2016 if the cuts are rescinded (the course Romney has said he wants to follow). So unless something is done to change the program\u2019s fiscal balance, Medicare would spend down its reserves for hospital payments within eight to 16 years. \"\"If you define guarantee benefit as simply receiving a Medicare card, then that only lasts until the money runs out,\"\" said Joshua Archambault, a former Romney aide who is now a health care policy specialist at the free-market Pioneer Institute. \"\"So I guess the president can make that claim until 2016 \u2026 but then he loses it.\"\" Even health care experts who are supportive of Obama\u2019s law do acknowledge that the concept of a Medicare \"\"guarantee\"\" may be too strongly worded. \"\"So long as the law is in place, people who meet specified eligibility requirements are assured specified benefits,\"\" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Still, \"\"nothing in the statutes is \u2018guaranteed,\u2019 because Congress always has the option of changing the law.\"\" Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has advised both Obama and Romney on health care reform, agreed. \"\"Under today's system, you have a guaranteed benefit, but one that is subject to political risk,\"\" he said. How Romney would change Medicare As for Romney\u2019s plan, it\u2019s important to note that it has not been been set out in full detail, and it hasn\u2019t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. But we\u2019ll explain it as best we can. Romney has said his plan would be close to the most recent one offered by his running mate, Paul Ryan. For people who are now under age 55, Medicare would no longer pay for seniors\u2019 health care bills directly. Instead, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available. We know that the Romney plan, like the status quo, would preserve the guarantee that people will start receiving coverage under a federal health care program when they turn 65. (The age threshold would gradually rise to 67 by 2034.) Less clear is whether the operational changes Romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under Medicare. The Romney campaign argues that not only would be traditional Medicare be a choice, but that private plan offerings must provide coverage at least comparable to what Medicare provides today, and that those plans would be Medicare-approved. However, since CBO hasn\u2019t weighed in, we don\u2019t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, especially over the longer term. The Obama campaign argues that \"\"Romney has said that under his voucher system, plans have to offer coverage that is \u2018comparable\u2019 to Medicare today\"\" -- a term they believe falls short of a guarantee of specific benefits. But Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health-care issues for President George W. Bush, says that\u2019s a smokescreen. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \"\"establishes the benefits covered by Medicare each year, and the private insurers in Medicare Advantage and Part D, the drug benefit, are required to cover at least that minimum benefit or its actuarial equivalent. That's exactly the Romney proposal.\"\" Under the most recent plan, Levin said, \"\"seniors are guaranteed at least one and generally two options that provide comprehensive coverage for no greater out-of-pocket costs than they have now.\"\" Levin also disputes the notion that the Romney plan is a pure defined-contribution plan. \"\"The Romney approach is a hybrid of defined benefit and defined contribution,\"\" he said. \"\"The minimum benefit is set by the government, and all competing insurers must meet it, but the government payment is determined by competitive bidding among those insurers to see how cheaply they can provide at least that minimum benefit.\"\" The most recent Republican plans have lessened the likelihood that Medicare\u2019s payment will fall behind the actual rise in health care costs, experts say, but given the limited details, there\u2019s still some uncertainty on this front. Under the Romney plan, MIT\u2019s Gruber said, you have the same political risk of a broken guarantee as you have today, but that guarantee is compounded by health spending risk. \"\"As health spending rises faster than your voucher, you are in trouble,\"\" he said. Our ruling In the ad, Obama said he \"\"will protect your guaranteed benefits\"\" in Medicare, while \"\"Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits.\"\" Obama exaggerates when he refers to \"\"guaranteed\"\" Medicare benefits under today\u2019s system. Currently, Medicare does \"\"guarantee\"\" a form of health coverage for seniors and, in the shorter term, guarantees specific benefits. But Medicare doesn\u2019t cover everything, and Congress and the president can change what is covered, and will be forced to do so when fiscal pressures hit. Meanwhile, it\u2019s plausible that the Romney plan could provide less of a \"\"guarantee\"\" than Medicare currently does, but we found sharp disagreement between supporters and opponents of Romney\u2019s Medicare plan on that point. This disagreement is hard to resolve given the shortage of information Romney has so far provided.\"n\nClaim: \"Barack Obama Says he \"\"will protect your guaranteed benefits\"\" in Medicare while \"\"Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim made by Barack Obama is 'partially true and false' because while it is true that Obama has expressed a commitment to protecting what are currently seen as guaranteed benefits in Medicare, the term 'guaranteed' itself is subject to interpretation and political risk, as benefits can be changed by legislation. On the other hand, Romney's plan, which proposes a shift to a voucher-like system, could potentially change the nature of how benefits are guaranteed, making them subject to market risks and potentially increasing out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries. However, the extent of these changes and their impact on the guarantee of benefits is not fully detailed and thus remains somewhat speculative. Therefore, the claim contains elements of truth regarding the intentions of both parties but also includes assumptions and interpretations that are not entirely conclusive."}

Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as \"\"die quickly\"\" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots -- is making another series of eye-catching claims. Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster.\"\" The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript:  Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) \"\"Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.\"\" Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) \"\"Wives submit yourself to your own husband.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us.\"\" Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL. Webster: \"\"You should submit to me. That's in the Bible.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers.\"\" Webster: \"\"Submit to me.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"He wants to force raped women to bear the child.\"\" Webster: \"\"Submit to me.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws.\"\" The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that \"\"Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands\"\" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: \"\"SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990).\"\" So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, \"\"creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.\"\" Florida law currently allows married couples to\u00a0divorce if a court finds that the marriage is \"\"irretrievably broken.\"\" It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary \"\"covenant marriage.\"\" Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:  \"\"I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.\"\" The covenant marriage agreement \"\"may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery,\"\" according to the bill Webster filed. \"\"A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted,\"\" HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that \"\"no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife,\"\" but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the \"\"original\"\" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was \"\"significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,\"\" Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad \"\"Taliban Dan Webster,\"\" Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce. Because all of that context is critical to understanding Grayson's claim,\"","sources":"http:\/\/www.healthymarriageinfo.org\/, https:\/\/docs.google.com\/fileview?id=1xNiW4XFXps_0ooYZxOlOrUsYq462A0sPeZbEfUYsVLwKsflhzEOGLlyE36E9&hl=en&authkey=CLaCxCU, http:\/\/www.supreme.state.az.us\/dr\/pdf\/covenant.pdf, http:\/\/labep.ucs.inrs.ca\/laplanteb\/DMO6500\/New%20Louisiana%20Covenant%20Marriage%20Law.htm, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dvB-mHXcWzg, https:\/\/www.flsenate.gov\/STATUTES\/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099\/0061\/0061.html, http:\/\/www.nwamarriages.com\/about\/pdf\/cov_marriage_app.pdf","label":3,"subjects":"Marriage, Message Machine 2010, Religion, Women, Florida, Alan Grayson, ","__index_level_0__":4741,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"U.S. Rep.

While you are still healthy and not showing any symptoms of H1N1 infection, in order to prevent proliferation, aggravation of symptoms and development of secondary infections, some very simple steps, not fully highlighted in most official communications, can be practiced (instead of focusing on how to stock N95 or Tamiflu): 1. Frequent hand-washing (well highlighted in all official communications). 2. \u201cHands-off-the-face\u201d approach. Resist all temptations to touch any part of face (unless you want to eat, bathe or slap). 3. *Gargle twice a day with warm salt water (use Listerine if you don\u2019t trust salt). *H1N1 takes 2-3 days after initial infection in the throat\/nasal cavity to proliferate and show characteristic symptoms.

{"claim_id":9538,"hypothesis":"New statin guidelines: Everyone 40 and older should be considered for the drug therapy","date_published":"November 17, 2016","explanation_1":"Despite an alarmist headline, this report of the USPSTF\u2019s recommendations on statin therapy is relatively thorough, with some notable exceptions. The strength of the evidence underlying the recommendations is not discussed and the actual amount of potential benefit from statin therapy is not mentioned, nor is the potential for harm adequately elaborated upon. Perhaps what is most missing from this \u201cjust-the-facts ma\u2019am\u201d article on the USPSTF\u2019s recommendations is the larger sense of context: major statin trials have all been funded by statin manufacturers where we know that adverse event information is incomplete and sometimes hidden, benefits are typically exaggerated as they are expressed in relative risk reductions, and that most people, physicians and patients included, will likely overestimate the benefit they might derive from statin therapy. Above all, the medicalizing of cholesterol levels in otherwise healthy people is considered by some to be\u00a0among the biggest current scandals in medicine. Having said that, it was good to see this article tipping\u00a0the hat toward those who have put forward very strong arguments against the measuring and altering of our blood cholesterols, mentioning the questionable chance of benefit and the many potential harms. It also was good to see that the article noted that there were at least two sides to this issue and that \u201cIndividual\u00a0doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\u201d \u00a0 Because this recommendation affects millions of Americans, how well it is understood, especially around the potential magnitude of benefit and potential for harm from long-term statin treatment, has huge implications for the health of the population. This recommendation is a great invitation\u00a0for health journalists, if they haven\u2019t already done so, to dig deeper and to introduce themselves to the many controversies over statins.","fact_checkers":"Alan Cassels,Richard Hoffman, MD,Joy Victory","premise":"Costs of the drugs are not included. Recently, total costs for statin therapy in the U.S. were estimated at approximately $17 billion. It would also be useful to know that there is a wide variety in prices over the many statins currently on the market. We don\u2019t know to what extent people in this category of risk (more than 10% or more than 7.5%) would benefit from statins, which would seem an essential and basic element of the story. Any recommendation that has the potential to alter the drug-taking habits of a huge swath of the population must be explained in numerical terms and so this was an unfilled gap. It mentions\u00a0\u201cmuscle pain and\u00a0cataracts [and] an increased risk for diabetes in women.\u201d This is sufficient, but the story would have been stronger if it had discussed frequency of these side effects, and mentioned the more serious (and thankfully more rare) risks of rhabdomyolysis and muscle breakdown. The quality of the evidence is not explained, even though typically the level of evidence behind a USPSTF review is high, and the USPSTF goes to the trouble of quantifying its evidence. (ie: grade A, B or C, etc). This is a tough call, but the most widely-read part of the story\u2013the headline\u2013does cross the line by suggesting everyone over 40\u00a0with some level of cardiovascular risk (which means MOST of us) should consider taking a statin. Some have written extensively of the problems of creating diseases out of risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or low bone density, and have fairly criticized the widespread dissemination of this type of population-wide, drug-industry funded disease mongering. The story includes independent sources and we didn\u2019t see any apparent conflicts of interest. There are many alternatives (cholesterol-altering agents, lifestyle factors and so on) that were worthy of mention. It\u2019s pretty clear and obvious that statins are available via\u00a0a doctor\u2019s prescription. The story establishes novelty of the task force report by explaining: The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of\u00a0whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease.

We don\u2019t know to what extent people in this category of risk (more than 10% or more than 7.5%) would benefit from statins, which would seem an essential and basic element of the story. Any recommendation that has the potential to alter the drug-taking habits of a huge swath of the population must be explained in numerical terms and so this was an unfilled gap. It mentions\u00a0\u201cmuscle pain and\u00a0cataracts [and] an increased risk for diabetes in women.\u201d This is sufficient, but the story would have been stronger if it had discussed frequency of these side effects, and mentioned the more serious (and thankfully more rare) risks of rhabdomyolysis and muscle breakdown. The quality of the evidence is not explained, even though typically the level of evidence behind a USPSTF review is high, and the USPSTF goes to the trouble of quantifying its evidence. (ie: grade A, B or C, etc). This is a tough call, but the most widely-read part of the story\u2013the headline\u2013does cross the line by suggesting everyone over 40\u00a0with some level of cardiovascular risk (which means MOST of us) should consider taking a statin. Some have written extensively of the problems of creating diseases out of risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or low bone density, and have fairly criticized the widespread dissemination of this type of population-wide, drug-industry funded disease mongering. The story includes independent sources and we didn\u2019t see any apparent conflicts of interest. There are many alternatives (cholesterol-altering agents, lifestyle factors and so on) that were worthy of mention. It\u2019s pretty clear and obvious that statins are available via\u00a0a doctor\u2019s prescription. The story establishes novelty of the task force report by explaining: The report greatly expands the universe of people who should be screened to see if they need the medication to everyone over age 40 regardless of\u00a0whether they have a history of cardiovascular disease. The presence of outside critique of these recommendations suggest there was a low reliance on the news release.n\nClaim: New statin guidelines: Everyone 40 and older should be considered for the drug therapy\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that 'everyone 40 and older should be considered for the drug therapy' is partially true because the report does expand the universe of people who should be screened to include everyone over age 40. However, it is also partially false as the claim may imply that all individuals over 40 should actually initiate statin therapy, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence. The evidence suggests that the recommendation is to screen these individuals to see if they need the medication, not necessarily to start everyone on it. Therefore, the claim is somewhat overstated in its simplification, not reflecting the nuances of the actual guidelines which focus on screening rather than universal treatment."}

Meanwhile, these private companies have seen their revenue and market share soar. They now rake in a combined $3.3 billion in annual revenue and the private federal prison population more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, according to a report by the Justice Policy Institute. Private companies house nearly half of the nation\u2019s immigrant detainees, compared to about 25 percent a decade ago, a Huffington Post report found. In total, there are now about 130 private prisons in the country with about 157,000 beds. A portion of that item included the source which was presumably the one paraphrased in the meme, attributed to a 2014 CCA annual report: The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them \u2026 Legislation has been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. A January 2013 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) piece provided both the quote and a link to its source CCA\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K filings, dated 25 February 2011. However, it\u2019s important to note the purpose of those mandatory 10-K filings, which include a \u201ccomprehensive overview of the company\u2019s business and financial condition.\u201d As SEC Chair Mary Jo White noted in 2013, a key aspect of those reports is disclosure of risk to shareholders and potential investors: Without proper disclosure, investors would be unable to make informed decisions. They would not know about the financial condition of the company they are investing in. Nor would they know about how the company operates, who its board members are or what business, operational or financial risks the company faces, let alone may face in the future. The core purpose of disclosure, of course, is to provide investors with the information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions. Such information makes it possible for investors to evaluate companies and have the confidence to invest and, as a result, allow our capital markets to flourish. In CCA\u2019s February 2011 Form 10-K filing, therefore, the company was not strategizing about how to prevent changes to existing laws that might adversely affect their profits, but rather listing a number of potential risks to profitability outside the company\u2019s control that shareholders and investors should be aware of: Our ability to secure new contracts to develop and manage correctional and detention facilities depends on many factors outside our control. Our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage new correctional and detention facilities. This possible growth depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions and acceptance of privatization. The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them. Legislation has been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. Also, sentencing alternatives under consideration could put some offenders on probation with electronic monitoring who would otherwise be incarcerated. Similarly, reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities. More recent SEC filings from CCA, such as a document for the year ending 31 December 2015, reflect similar stated risks to investors. That filing also included a statement from CCA that, as a matter of policy, the company does not \u201clobby for or against policies or legislation that would determine the basis for, or duration of, an individual\u2019s incarceration or detention\u201d: This possible growth depends on a number of factors we cannot control, including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions, governmental budgetary constraints, and governmental and public acceptance of privatization.

For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them. Immigration reform laws are currently a focus for legislators and politicians at the federal, state, and local level. Legislation has also been proposed in numerous jurisdictions that could lower minimum sentences for some non-violent crimes and make more inmates eligible for early release based on good behavior. Also, sentencing alternatives under consideration could put some offenders on probation with electronic monitoring who would otherwise be incarcerated. Similarly, reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities. Our company does not, under longstanding policy, lobby for or against policies or legislation that would determine the basis for, or duration of, an individual\u2019s incarceration or detention. Nonetheless, the image meme also alleges that the company spends approximately a million dollars per year fighting cannabis legalization. The Center for Responsive Politics\u2018 \u00a0Open Secrets site (a watchdog organization that tracks lobbying efforts) maintains a profile for CCA that places its total expenditures on all lobbying efforts in 2015 at exactly $1,000,000 (and $1,020,000 in 2014). However, the opacity surrounding lobbying makes it difficult to determine precisely how much (if anything) CCA might spend for the purpose of influencing marijuana laws. According to the ACLU 2013 piece referenced above, the company\u2019s lobbying efforts were spread across numerous political interests: Although CCA insists that it does not engage in \u201clobbying or advocacy efforts that would influence enforcement efforts, parole standards, criminal laws, and sentencing policies,\u201d the company spends heavily on both campaign contributions and lobbying. In 2011, CCA gave $710,300 in political contributions to candidates for federal or state office, political parties, and 527 groups (PACs and super-PACs). That same year, CCA spent $1.07 million lobbying federal officials and an undisclosed amount lobbying state officials. Additionally, as NPR reported two years ago, CCA was for many years involved in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), an organization of state legislators and corporations that drafted the basis for Arizona\u2019s anti-immigrant SB1070 and that has consistently advocated for harsh sentencing and detention laws. The breakdown of the $1,020,000 spent on lobbying by CCA in 2014 as presented on Open Secrets wasn\u2019t broken down in detail. CCA\u2019s top lobbying expenditures were listed as \u201cHomeland Security\u201d and \u201cGovernment Issues,\u201d with \u201cLaw Enforcement & Crime\u201d at number three. Apparently the meme cited the total amount of money CCA spends on lobbying and inaccurately framed all of those expenditures as targeting \u201ccannabis legalization.\u201d H.R.4903 (a bill appropriating funds for immigration security in 2013-2014) was listed on Open Secrets as a top interest for which CCA lobbied, which dovetails with CCA disclosures mentioning the jailing of undocumented immigrants. Open Secrets simply listed CCA among agencies possessing an interest in the continued criminalization of marijuana, without providing any details about monies those agencies might expend along those lines: Private prisons are in the business of filling beds, and they make millions by incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders along with violent offenders and white-collar criminals. One private prison company, the GEO Group, Inc., is particularly successful at this: In its 2014 annual report, GEO noted that it had, on average, a facility occupancy rate of 95.7 percent. One of the largest for-profit prison companies, Corrections Corporation of America, stated in a 2010 regulatory filing that laxer drug laws could shrink its bottom line: \u201c[A]ny changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.\u201d Since 2008, the Corrections Corporation of America has spent at least $970,000 a year on lobbying. However, in its federal lobbying reports, the corporation includes a disclaimer that it does not lobby for or against policies that would determine whether an individual is incarcerated. ProPublica found much the same in an\u00a0investigation pertaining partly to\u00a0CCA: while that entity reported CCA spent $17.4 million in a ten-year period on general lobbying, they included no marijuana-specific findings.

If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used??

Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. From all over the world. All over the whole wide world.\u201dThat article was published at 12:36 PM on March 20 2020, and at that time, masks were still being collected and sought:Despite all the attention, they\u2019ll need as many people as possible to step forward.Just before 2PM on March 20 2020, the text on the Facebook post was replaced with the above update, but the instructional video remained. So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.","sources":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/blog.providence.org\/coronavirus\/volunteers-making-homemade-masks-to-combat-shortages-caused-by-covid-19, https:\/\/www.providence.org\/lp\/100m-masks, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control\/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/infection-control\/control-recommendations.html, https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/coronavirus-interview-larry-brilliant-smallpox-epidemiologist\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27100+Million+Masks%27+--+Are+Homemade+Masks+Sufficient+for+COVID-19+First+Responders%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/face-masks.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/respirators-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/rapunzel-was-quarantined-in-tangled-google-the-name-of-her-kingdom\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-deaconess-ask-public-provide-medical-face-masks\/2865273001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/20\/coronvavirus-whole-world-responding-deaconess-face-masks-plea\/2884671001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/letters-health-care-providers\/surgical-mask-and-gown-conservation-strategies-letter-healthcare-providers, https:\/\/washington.providence.org\/about, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/natural-news-cdc-coronavirus\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeaconessHealthSystem\/posts\/10156622869747273?__cft__[0]=AZWNrouqxgFJbXaeggpz4E2RA8iOBJtkFvtemEZn4bq-hM2QI5K2E1IGUqrrCs9LhNGBN4mRzgLOh-OIyGFpI5jhdP3Xhm_rsPbfe4vOnKuYENNBdpfy3BUEB_8nnGrPF_gd1XN4qgLtXa8KhvV2sujUIxfHi1WLv3VEwkav9wASkA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1012,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn March 20 2020, KOMO anchor Mary Nam shared a photograph of a person wearing a surgical mask (a form of personal protective equipment, or PPE, known to be in short supply due the coronavirus pandemic), and put out a call for anyone who knows how to sew and has access to a sewing machine to participate in an effort to fortify COVID-19 medical supplies with homemade surgical masks:Know how to sew?

The mask design was lab tested to ensure safety and effectiveness. **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained a page, \u201cN95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks),\u201d defining the terms used during discussions of PPE shortages; linked on that page was a March 11 2020 letter from the FDA about coping with PPE shortages in a clinical environment:N95 respirators and surgical masks (face masks) are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated? Including the school lunches they are delivering?? Doesnt the virus live on things for a period of time? Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks.

Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.n\nClaim: Homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other personal protective equipment (PPE).\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that homemade masks are sufficient against coronavirus exposure during a shortage of masks, N95 respirators, and other PPE is partially true and false. According to the CDC, in times of critical shortages, healthcare professionals might use homemade masks as a last resort. However, these masks are not considered PPE, as their effectiveness in protecting against coronavirus is unknown. The CDC emphasizes that this approach should only be used when absolutely necessary and ideally in combination with a face shield. This suggests that while homemade masks can provide some level of protection in desperate situations, they are not sufficiently reliable or recommended under normal circumstances where better protective equipment is available."}

Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available. But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. \"\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"\"may be effective\"\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"\"when there are insufficient supplies.\"\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"\"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\" The reasons are multiple. For one thing, research is limited on how effective this type of decontamination is. Also, masks vary in how they stand up to the procedure. And it\u2019s not as simple as doing a load of laundry. \"\"Decontamination is a complicated process,\"\" said Hana El-Samad, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California-San Francisco, who researches N95 sanitization. \"\"Assessing how well it works and which N95 makes and models remain unaffected is an area of active research,\"\" she said. N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration. Performance is only part of the equation. Another is mask structure: N95s work only when properly fitted to the face. When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear. Battelle\u2019s 20-time reusability metric, he added, was calculated without factoring in the impact of regular hospital use. In addition, decontamination itself can in some cases worsen the respirator\u2019s fit. \"\"If [an N95] doesn\u2019t fit well, then air will leak around the sides and it doesn\u2019t matter how good a filter it is,\"\" Kenney said. Plus, using this technology requires hospitals to have other protocols in place. Used masks must be safely collected \u2015 since they could be COVID-contaminated and pose a biohazard \u2014 and a plan must be in place to move them to and from the sanitization facility. \"\"These are all complicated processes that need to be done right,\"\" El-Samad said. She offered a key takeaway: Technology like Battelle\u2019s can help. But nothing substitutes for new N95s. In describing ongoing efforts to reuse protective respirators, Trump said the United States is using \"\"some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask.\"\" That, he argued, \"\"is like ordering 20 times more masks.\"\" It is true that technology exists to sterilize N95s up to 20 times.
