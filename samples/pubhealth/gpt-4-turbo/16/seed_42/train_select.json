He will be (Mr.) Bloggs. And his rehabilitation will only be effective if he comes to terms with being Bloggs - and fulfils what Bloggs can do,\u201d said Richard Greenwood, a consultant neurologist at London\u2019s Homerton Hospital and at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very difficult process to take people through - and many people don\u2019t achieve it.\u201d  Greenwood was speaking at a briefing for reporters on the results of a study into the long-term effects of traumatic brain injuries caused by blows to the head. The study, published on Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, found that survivors of TBIs are three times more likely to die prematurely than the general population, often from suicide or fatal accidents. Seena Fazel of Oxford University\u2019s Department of Psychiatry, who led the study, said the exact reasons for the increased risk of premature death - which in this study was defined as dying before the age of 56 - are not clear. But he said they may be linked to damage to parts of the brain responsible for judgment, decision-making and risk-taking. TBI survivors are three times more likely to die from fatal injuries that may be a due to impaired judgment or reactions. They are also at increased risk of developing psychiatric illnesses such as depression and anxiety, which can lead to patients having difficulties dealing with new situations and organizing their lives. A TBI is a blow to the head that leads to a skull fracture, internal bleeding, loss of consciousness for longer than an hour or a combination of these symptoms. Some 1.7 million people in the United States and one million people in Europe are hospitalized after TBIs each year. Experts say typical causes include road accidents, falls and sports injuries, and Schumacher\u2019s skiing injury - sustained when he slammed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in the French Alps - is a an example of this type of injury.

The results were based on a study in the Morbidity and Mortality report, the agency\u2019s weekly report on death and disease. According to the report, more than 9,000 children age 12 and younger died in a car crash from 2002 to 2011. \u201cThe good news is motor vehicle deaths decreased by 43 percent over the past decade for children age 12 and younger. The tragic news is still with that decrease, more than 9,000 kids were killed on the road in this period,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference. \u201cThousands of children are at risk on the road because they are not buckled up,\u201d he said. The study found that of the children who died between 2009 to 2010, a much higher proportion of black and Hispanic children were not buckled, compared with white kids. \u201cThe difference was nearly half (45 percent for blacks and 46 percent for Hispanics) versus a quarter (26 percent) for white kids,\u201d Frieden said. The study did not investigate why racial differences played such a big role in seat belt use, but it did suggest socio-economic factors may play a role. For the study, CDC researchers analyzed data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find the number of deaths among occupants in cars from 2002 to 2011 for all children aged up to the age of 12. Overall, 9,182 children died in car crashes during the period. But deaths dropped sharply, from 2.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002, to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2011, a 43 percent decline. According to the report, seat belt use increased from 88 percent in 2002 to 91 percent in 2011 among all children age 7 and under. The study also confirmed earlier findings that older children are less likely to be wearing seat belts than younger children. To prevent future deaths from car crashes, Frieden said parents should make sure their children use appropriate-sized car seats, booster seats and seat belts on every trip. The CDC recommends that children from birth to age 2 should be in a rear-facing car seat. Starting at age 2, children should be in a forward-facing car seat until at least age 5, or when they reach the upper weight or height limit of that seat. Children age 5 and older should use a booster seat until the adult seat belt fits them properly, generally when the lap belt lays across the upper thighs and the shoulder belt slays across the chest, but not the neck.

Needless to say, it was shocking.Several members of our team asked the customer to remove it, and all requests were ignored until the customer was in the checkout area. This was a disturbing incident for our associates and customers, and we are reviewing with our team how to best handle such inappropriate situations in the future.A second man, identified as Dustin Hart, posted video online of himself shopping in a Food 4 Less store in the same community wearing a mask bearing the Nazi swastika symbol on May 7, 2020. Hart has claimed that he wore the symbol to \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d stay-at-home measures implemented by Gov. Gavin Newsom. He refused to remove the mask when asked about it by both authorities and store personnel. The Sheriff\u2019s Department is also investigating that incident.During its meeting on May 13, 2020 the city council voted to address the two incidents by allowing Minto to nominate more people to a separate group, the Community Oriented Policing Committee (COMPOP).

Standing quietly,\u201d one woman told the Times of San Diego. \u201cA man in a wheelchair [went] past and saluted him and he laughed. I took the photo because I couldn\u2019t believe what I was witnessing. I\u2019ve grown up in Santee and have never seen such racism right before my eyes.\u201dThe San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement at the time that it had \u201cbeen made aware\u201d of the incident but that deputies were not called to the store while the man was there.\u201cDetectives from the Sheriff\u2019s Department are looking into the matter and will pursue any appropriate criminal charges,\u201d the department said. \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department does not condone hate or any acts of intolerance in our communities. We are a county that is welcoming of people from all backgrounds.\u201dAccording to the San Diego Union-Tribune, though, the department later said that it would not pursue charges against the man citing \u201cinsufficient evidence.\u201dLocated in the eastern part of San Diego County, Santee has been derisively nicknamed \u201cKlantee\u201d by other San Diego residents. At least eight white supremacist groups are reportedly still active in the San Diego area, and local white nationalist figure Roger Ogden was identified as the organizer of an event protesting measures seeking to limit the spread of COVID-19 using \u201cfreedom\u201d as a pretext. The demonstrations, largely organized via Facebook, have largely attracted white nationalist groups, who have taken the opportunity to spread anti-Semitic and\u00a0Nazi-related rhetoric.Mayor John Minto released a joint statement with the Santee City Council condemning the unidentified Vons shopper\u2019s behavior.\u201cMany thanks to all who stepped forward to curtail this sad reminder of intolerance,\u201d the statement read. \u201cSantee, its leaders, and I will not tolerate such behavior. Santee and its citizens are great, and this particular individual\u2019s actions are not representative of us as a people and a wonderful city.\u201dAlbertsons, the parent company for the Vons chain, also released a statement:At Vons, fostering an environment of courtesy, dignity and respect is one of our highest priorities, and we work hard to hold everyone in our stores to these standards, including customers.Unfortunately, an alarming and isolated incident occurred at our Vons store in Santee, where a customer chose an inflammatory method of wearing a face covering. Needless to say, it was shocking.Several members of our team asked the customer to remove it, and all requests were ignored until the customer was in the checkout area. This was a disturbing incident for our associates and customers, and we are reviewing with our team how to best handle such inappropriate situations in the future.A second man, identified as Dustin Hart, posted video online of himself shopping in a Food 4 Less store in the same community wearing a mask bearing the Nazi swastika symbol on May 7, 2020. Hart has claimed that he wore the symbol to \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d stay-at-home measures implemented by Gov. Gavin Newsom. He refused to remove the mask when asked about it by both authorities and store personnel. The Sheriff\u2019s Department is also investigating that incident.During its meeting on May 13, 2020 the city council voted to address the two incidents by allowing Minto to nominate more people to a separate group, the Community Oriented Policing Committee (COMPOP). The mayor said he planned to nominate at least one Black member as well as a member of the ADL.

{"claim_id":9779,"hypothesis":"Bacteria From Mother May Colonize Cesarean Births","date_published":"February 5, 2016","explanation_1":"This is a well-articulated but incomplete story about a proof-of-principle study suggesting that when babies born by C-section are swabbed with their mother\u2019s vaginal fluids, they have a microbiome more closely approximating\u00a0those of their vaginally-born peers up to a month after birth. The article does a nice job of explaining the science and placing the evidence in context, but we think that it missed the mark on the potential harms of the intervention. This is a significant omission. Emerging research suggests that the types and patterns\u00a0of natural bacteria growing on our bodies are important for healthy immune, digestive, and metabolic systems. Babies born by C-section do not have the benefit of being colonized by the natural\u00a0bacteria in their mothers\u2019 vaginal tracts, so an alternative method for inoculating babies with these bacteria (and an inexpensive, easy-to-implement one, at that) may even the playing field for C-section babies.","fact_checkers":"Ishani Ganguli, MD, MPH,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kevin Lomangino","premise":"The article does not discuss the costs associated with inoculation. However, it\u2019s implied that vaginal microbial transfer is very inexpensive (it only requires a piece of gauze, saline, and a sterile bottle \u2013 all standard hospital supplies) so we won\u2019t ding the story for this omission. With that being said, there is a tacit assumption in the article that the transfer of bacteria from the mother\u2019s vaginal fluids to the newborn is always in the best interest of the newborn. Clearly this is not the case as we will articulate later. If there is a risk of the transfer of less than desirable bacteria, it is reasonable to assume that bacterial screening of vaginal secretions might be undertaken (which would add cost). The transfer of pathogens to the newborn inducing infection would also have a cost. While it is beyond the scope of this report, we think that thinking about the potential downsides of a new intervention is in order. The article does a nice job of detailing the potential benefits of the microbial transfer and the results seen in the study, while giving the caveat that longer follow up studies are needed to understand the implications of various microbiome make-ups. But to be fair, the results are from a total of 4 newborns, hardly a number on which to base any strong conclusions. The story says that thus far the procedure \u201chas proved entirely safe,\u201d but we\u2019re talking about only four babies here! The article assumes that all the bacteria in the mother\u2019s vaginal secretions are \u201cfriendly.\u201d \u00a0This is clearly not the case in all patients. Significant infections can be transmitted to the newborn from bacteria resident in the mothers vaginal secretions from less than friendly bacteria\u00a0including Chlamydia, Listeria and group B Strep to name a few. Suggesting that the procedure is not recommended but then pointing out that Dr. Brubaker had the procedure done for her newborn supports the notion that this is a harmless procedure \u2014 a potentially dangerous message. The story describes the study as small and proof-of-principle, although it arguably should have made more out of the fact that only four babies underwent the swabbing procedure. That\u2019s a very small number. Nevertheless, we think the story injects enough caution to earn a Satisfactory rating. We liked that it spelled out the next phase of study to provide readers with a realistic sense of the scientific process. This article appropriately addresses the issue of increasing C-section use in U.S. and its potential repercussions. The article quotes several outside sources with the comments of Drs.

{"claim_id":27582,"hypothesis":"The United States is deporting military veterans.","date_published":"February 8, 2016","explanation_1":"Honorably-discharged veterans of the U.S. military have, under certain circumstances, either received deportation orders or been deported.","fact_checkers":"Brooke Binkowski","premise":"Immigration is a sensitive and touchy issue, and never more so than in the United States during an election year. Thus, when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the U.S. military living in Mexico after they had been\u00a0deported from the United States (a story we\u00a0previously reported on) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite. However, deported veterans exist, although no one \u2014 not even the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 knows how many. Their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream American consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in Tijuana. \u201cThe Bunker,\u201d also known as the Deported Veterans Support House, is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in Mexico\u2019s border town of Tijuana, and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the United States military, who fought everywhere from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Former Army paratrooper Hector Barajas, 39, opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who, like him, had been deported: \u201cI started The Bunker because there was a need,\u201d Barajas told us. He said since his deportation, he had been meeting others like him living in Tijuana, and discovered that they lived throughout Mexico\u00a0\u2014 but not just Mexico. There are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries, he said. Since then, The Bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause: Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home. We shouldn\u2019t honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for. It may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the United States military does not automatically confer citizenship, but it doesn\u2019t. It can smooth\u00a0the way, provided the aspiring\u00a0citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe. However, it\u2019s not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume (having never been told otherwise) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship, and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait. Sometimes, too, there are bureaucratic foulups. One man was deported after\u00a0he was unable to attend a hearing, despite his reason: he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time. Others do everything the way they\u2019re supposed to, filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings, but still get deported, and no one seems to know\u00a0exactly why. Once they are outside the U.S., they maintain a\u00a0legal right to VA benefits such as healthcare, and to whatever funds they might be entitled, but they have no way of getting back into the United States to obtain that assistance, and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them. Because these particular veterans are either in the United States on green cards or without documentation after their discharges, they can be deported with cause, or for no reason at all. Past and present members of the armed forces\u00a0are supposed to receive special consideration\u00a0during deportation hearings, but the\u00a0guidelines are inconsistently applied. However, some\u00a0of these veterans have\u00a0spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses, which makes their situation more difficult to parse, at least politically. Elected officials (and\u00a0candidates) who might ordinarily be in full-throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers. Sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the American flag\u00a0suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before. Miguel Perez, a United States Army veteran, falls under that category. The 39-year-old Illinois man, who served two tours in Afghanistan and who has been in the U.S. since he was eight, was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008. The green card holder had served half of a 15-year prison sentence when Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement took him for deportation proceedings. After losing an appeal, Perez was deported in March 2018: Perez was flown from Gary, Indiana, to Brownsville, Texas, where officers escorted him across the border and turned him over to Mexican authorities, ICE officials said. Perez appeared shocked by his treatment during his final moments on U.S. soil. An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would \u201cfix this\u201d while leading him to a gate, Perez said. \u201cWhen we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done here,'\u201d he said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally? This is it?\u201d The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to\u00a0return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don\u2019t apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes. It would also prevent the removal of military veterans from the U.S. in the future. On 13 April 2018, Hector Barajas, the deported veteran who was one of the first to shine a spotlight on their plight, received his American citizenship, potentially paving the way for hundreds of other former United States military members:","sources":" ","label":0,"subjects":"Politics Immigration, deported veteran, immigration, mexico","__index_level_0__":8265,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nImmigration is a sensitive and touchy issue, and never more so than in the United States during an election year.

An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would \u201cfix this\u201d while leading him to a gate, Perez said. \u201cWhen we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done here,'\u201d he said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally? This is it?\u201d The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to\u00a0return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don\u2019t apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes. It would also prevent the removal of military veterans from the U.S. in the future. On 13 April 2018, Hector Barajas, the deported veteran who was one of the first to shine a spotlight on their plight, received his American citizenship, potentially paving the way for hundreds of other former United States military members:n\nClaim: The United States is deporting military veterans.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"entailment","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence provided explicitly confirms that military veterans who are non-citizens have been deported from the United States. Instances such as the story of Hector Barajas and Miguel Perez, among others, clearly illustrate that veterans who served in the U.S. military but did not secure U.S. citizenship were subjected to deportation. Additionally, the establishment of 'The Bunker' or the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana further substantiates the claim, as it serves as a refuge for deported U.S. military veterans. Therefore, the claim that the United States is deporting military veterans is true based on the provided evidence."}

{"claim_id":10658,"hypothesis":"Shingles Vaccine Cuts Disease Risk 55%","date_published":"January 11, 2011","explanation_1":"This story about how the shingles vaccine performs in the real world takes a somewhat different tack from the HealthDay and Reuters stories we also reviewed. It includes discussion of a second study documenting low usage rates of the vaccine, but the story fails to give readers any comments from experts (like those quoted in the HealthDay story) who explain why some people have put a lower priority on the shingles vaccine. The story covers many of the basic points on the effectiveness study, though readers are not told what is new and different about this study compared to earlier research. There is a good description of who was included in this study, but little attention to the potential sources of bias inherent in this sort of observational study. In addition to reporting the 55 percent reduction in relative risk and the absolute risk reduction (6 versus 13 cases per 1,000 people per year), we wish this story had noted that the study found that 71 people need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one from having a shingles attack. When this story discusses the study documenting low usage rates, it states that \u201cdoctors may not be aware of the new recommendation.\u201d It could be argued that many doctors have been aware of the recommendations, but have had a healthy skepticism of the original study, and did not yet have the results of this current study, which is at least a start at getting information on the generalizability of the original study\u2019s results. Many doctors may be cautious about immediately jumping on the bandwagon of a new vaccine. If patients are healthy, the onus is on the physician to provide more good than harm, especially in prevention. Finally, the story is unbalanced when it ends with this comment without challenging it:\u00a0 \u201cOnce the patients learn about it, most are agreeable\u2026\u201dEverybody wants it\u2026\u201d Our medical editor who reviewe this story believes that many patients are cautious and\/or skeptical of new vaccines (or any vaccines, for that matter), especially when the condition is shingles, and many patients do not think of the condition with \u201chorror stories\u201d but rather something usually self-limiting and also treatable.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"This story includes a comment that \u201cvaccine expense is another barrier for some\u201d and that not all insurance plans cover the cost of this vaccine, but readers are not told that it can cost about $200. Nonetheless, we\u2019ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion since cost and insurance are at least addressed. Although this story leads with only the relative risk reduction of 55 percent that researchers found in this study, it quickly places that effect in context with that of other vaccines (which generally provide greater protection). The story also reports the absolute risk figures of 6.4 cases per 1,000 people per year among those vaccinated and 13 cases per 1,000 people per year among those who were not vaccinated. These numbers help readers put the effects into the overall context of the risk of shingles. We think readers would have benefitted from also being told that based on the results of this study, one case of shingles is prevented for every 71 people vaccinated. This figure makes clear that while some people who are vaccinated are spared from a shingles attack, not everyone should expect to personally benefit from vaccination. The story should have pointed out  that the study looked at a limited time span and that the researchers can\u2019t say whether the effects of the vaccine persist through later years. That\u2019s an important caveat, since a 60-year-old who had chicken pox as a child is at risk for a shingles attack for the remaining decades of life. If the vaccine cuts the risk of attacks in half, but only for the first few years after vaccination, then the lifetime reduction in risk would be much smaller. The story reports that earlier research identified side effects of the vaccine, including redness and pain at the injection site. But an inquiring story would have asked about side effects in the new study. Although this story did a better job than the other stories we reviewed in describing the participants of this study as members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan in southern California, like the other stories, it failed to address the potential sources of bias inherent in this sort of observational study. The study authors highlighted the limitations of the study design and explained what they did to try to identify and adjust for bias. The story should have given readers more information on these study limitations. The story reports that this vaccine is recommended for people 60 and older. It also includes a comment about who should not get the vaccine, \u201cincluding people with a compromised immune system and certain cancers.\u201d Our medical editor on this story thought there was an element of disease-mongering in how the story didn\u2019t emphasize that it is post-herpetic neuralgia that \u201ccan last months or even years\u201d and by not then emphasizing immediately that most people with zoster do not have this condition. But we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. The story includes an independent source. However, the comments of the independent source don\u2019t address the specific methods or findings of this study. Instead, they begin to wander off into a discussion of the relationship between stress and shingles attacks. The story does tell readers that this study was funded by the Kaiser Permanente health plan and that the lead author has received support from the vaccine\u2019s maker for other research. As this story points out, less than 7 percent of people age 60 or older have gotten the shingles vaccine (while many more in that group have gotten flu, pneumonia and other vaccinations). The story should have addressed the reasons that so many primary care physicians and their older patients have decided that deferring vaccination against shingles is a reasonable option. The shared decision-making option of NOT\u00a0being vaccinated was not given a forum here.

{"claim_id":9544,"hypothesis":"Balloon-in-a-pill helped obese patients lose weight","date_published":"November 10, 2016","explanation_1":"Credit: FDA safety materials on Obalon This story about a balloon swallowed by people with obesity\u00a0to help them diet and lose weight is more informative than the associated conference news release we also reviewed. The overall tone of the story balances the positive spin from a researcher with skeptical comments from independent sources. It alerts readers that this sort of medical conference presentation does not go through the peer review process that major journals use. However, the story should have noted that the research was sponsored by the company that makes the device. It could have done a better job pointing out that the main difference between this device and other intragastric balloons already on the market is that this one doesn\u2019t require patients to be sedated during placement. The story also didn\u2019t point out that this type of device could cause life-threatening complications, and that the fact none were reported in this trial could be because fewer than 200 participants received the balloons. Patients want help comparing treatment options. Rather than highlighting results of a trial that merely compared this new weight loss balloon to a placebo, this story could have made more clear that there is no evidence yet that this device is any better or worse than similar products already on the market. It also could have helped readers by explaining that these results need to\u00a0be weighed against intensive behavioral weight loss programs (like the LookAHEAD trial, where one-year outcomes were better than balloon).","fact_checkers":"Andrew Holtz, MPH,Yoni Freedhoff, MD,Joy Victory","premise":"While the story notes that the U.S. price of the Obalon intragastric balloon has yet to be announced, the story could have reported that the device and related care typically cost $2,500 to $4,000 in Europe, where it has been available for almost three years. Costs are also likely markedly higher than working with a behavioral team. The story quantified benefits by stating: Obese patients who swallowed balloon capsules that helped them eat less lost an average of 15 pounds, roughly two times more weight than patients who just dieted and exercised, researchers report. and: People treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said. In addition to reporting the weight loss results announced by researchers and that, unlike other balloons, this device doesn\u2019t require patients to be sedated during placement, the story adds important context by including comments from independent sources who are skeptical that many patients will maintain their lower weight long after the device is removed. The story mentions these harms: As for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate. The story would have been stronger if it had warned readers that a study that puts a device in only a couple of hundred people may miss problems that could appear after the device is placed in hundreds of thousands or even millions of patients. The documentation that the manufacturer will give patients lists several serious, even life-threatening, potential side effects, including intestinal and airway blockages. These potential risks should have been noted. The story reports the key features of the trial. It also notes that, \u201cResearch presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\u201d The story would have been stronger if it clearly reported that the trial does not provide any evidence about whether the Obalon device is any better or worse than other options, because it did not compare it to similar balloons or to other weight loss interventions, other than the lifestyle counseling offered to all study participants. The researcher quoted in the story notes that this device could be an option for people who are leery of surgery. Independent sources quoted in the story predict a small role for such devices. One of the strongest aspects of this story is the ample use of independent sources to provide context and point out limitations of the device. However, this criterion demands that sponsors of research be identified, and this story does not tell readers that the trial was sponsored by Obalon Therapeutics. The story includes discussion of weight loss surgery and lifestyle interventions. It includes a quote noting that the Obalon device does not require patients to be sedated during insertion, which implies there are other similar balloon devices, though the story would have been better if it specifically noted that there are already two very similar devices available in the U.S. as well as other balloon devices that are for sale in other countries. It also could have pointed out that these results don\u2019t appear more effective than an intensive\u00a0behavioral program. The story reports that the Obalon balloon was approved by the FDA in September and will be available in January 2017. As noted above, the story reports that the Obalon device does not require patients to be sedated during insertion, which appears to be the main difference between this device and other similar balloons. It would have been better if it had more clearly informed readers that there are other intragastric balloon devices already on the market. The story notes that these study results also were\u00a0presented back in May.

In addition to reporting the weight loss results announced by researchers and that, unlike other balloons, this device doesn\u2019t require patients to be sedated during placement, the story adds important context by including comments from independent sources who are skeptical that many patients will maintain their lower weight long after the device is removed. The story mentions these harms: As for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate. The story would have been stronger if it had warned readers that a study that puts a device in only a couple of hundred people may miss problems that could appear after the device is placed in hundreds of thousands or even millions of patients. The documentation that the manufacturer will give patients lists several serious, even life-threatening, potential side effects, including intestinal and airway blockages. These potential risks should have been noted. The story reports the key features of the trial. It also notes that, \u201cResearch presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\u201d The story would have been stronger if it clearly reported that the trial does not provide any evidence about whether the Obalon device is any better or worse than other options, because it did not compare it to similar balloons or to other weight loss interventions, other than the lifestyle counseling offered to all study participants. The researcher quoted in the story notes that this device could be an option for people who are leery of surgery. Independent sources quoted in the story predict a small role for such devices. One of the strongest aspects of this story is the ample use of independent sources to provide context and point out limitations of the device. However, this criterion demands that sponsors of research be identified, and this story does not tell readers that the trial was sponsored by Obalon Therapeutics. The story includes discussion of weight loss surgery and lifestyle interventions. It includes a quote noting that the Obalon device does not require patients to be sedated during insertion, which implies there are other similar balloon devices, though the story would have been better if it specifically noted that there are already two very similar devices available in the U.S. as well as other balloon devices that are for sale in other countries. It also could have pointed out that these results don\u2019t appear more effective than an intensive\u00a0behavioral program. The story reports that the Obalon balloon was approved by the FDA in September and will be available in January 2017. As noted above, the story reports that the Obalon device does not require patients to be sedated during insertion, which appears to be the main difference between this device and other similar balloons. It would have been better if it had more clearly informed readers that there are other intragastric balloon devices already on the market. The story notes that these study results also were\u00a0presented back in May. The story includes several quotes from independent sources, as well as important details that were not included in a news release from the organizers of the the medical meeting where these results were presented.

China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.\"\" The Guangdong provincial government has responded to concerns about discrimination by calling China and Africa good friends, partners and brothers, according to the BBC. More than two dozen Africans told CNN about being left without a home, being subject to random testing for COVID-19, or being quarantined for 14 days in their homes, despite having no symptoms or contact with known patients. Photos and videos posted on social media showed Africans sleeping on sidewalks or waiting under shop awnings after being ordered out of their apartments and hotel rooms, the Washington Post reported. And community leaders told the BBC that hundreds of Africans had been evicted after online rumors that coronavirus was spreading among African people. A video shared on Facebook claims that \"\"Africans living in China now being forced to sleep outside in the cold.\"\" Numerous news articles report that, amid fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, China has focused on foreigners as a possible source of the virus, and Africans in the southern China city of Guangzhou are being evicted from their homes.

What's undetermined: It's too early to tell if the spread of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will be dampened by warm weather.","fact_checkers":"Dan Evon","premise":"On Feb. 10, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump told the crowd at his rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, that the new coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, could, in theory, miraculously go away in April when it gets a little warmer. Trump said: \u201cThe virus, they\u2019re working hard, looks like by April you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away. I hope that\u2019s true.\u201d Trump has repeated this claim a few times. On Twitter, for instance, he wrote that as \u201cthe weather heats up\u201d the virus will hopefully become weaker. And during a meeting with various state governors in February, he said \u201ca lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat \u2014 as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April.\u201d It is simply too early to tell how warm weather will impact the spread of COVID-19. What we do know is that this strain of coronavirus can spread during warm weather, and that it won\u2019t just \u201cgo away\u201d in April. Some strains of coronavirus, such as those that cause the common cold or influenza, typically spread during cold weather and then subside as the weather heats up. Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, explained to Time Magazine: \u201cThe droplets that carry viruses do not stay suspended in humid air as long, and the warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation.\u201d Another reason why some diseases flourish during colder months is because people spend a lot of time indoors and in crowded, poorly ventilated public places.

He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201d","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":5202,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made.

Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201dn\nClaim: U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that U.S. President Donald Trump intentionally used his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who corrected him cannot be confirmed due to the lack of definitive evidence about his intent behind the gesture. The analysis and additional incidents provided show that Trump has used similar gestures in various contexts, some of which are benign and not directed at any individual in a negative manner. Without clear evidence or confirmation of Trump's intent to use the gesture as an offensive signal specifically in the incident with the astronaut, it remains speculative to conclude the gesture was meant as an act of disrespect."}

While it is true hummingbirds are drawn to red, there is more than one way to entice a bird. According to an entry found in the Audubon Society\u2019s FAQ: Current thinking is that the red dye may not be good for them, nor is it necessary to attract hummingbirds. The color on your feeder is enough to attract them. You can mix your own nectar using 1\/4 cup sugar to every 1 cup of water.

The statement\u2019s final paragraph indicated that ETP was not giving up on DAPL, but in no part\u00a0of that statement did they say that\u00a0the company would continue to drill. However, it did say that they plan to finish construction of the pipeline as planned, without providing details: As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. It is possible that the company\u2019s statement alongside a clearly speculative response\u00a0shared\u00a0(but not written) by prominent protester Dallas Goldtooth prompted the rumor: WILL THIS ACTUALLY STOP CONSTRUCTION? Debatable. It would be illegal for Energy Transfer Partners to drill under the Missouri, but that\u2019s not to say they won\u2019t do it and opt to pay whatever legal penalties they incur. That would be a fairly shocking move on their part but they\u2019ve hinted they may be open to doing it. It\u2019s easy to imagine that an incoming Trump administration would do their best to make the penalties as minimal as possible.n\nClaim: Despite a decision that halted construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), Energy Transfer Partners continued to build it and accept a $50,000 daily fine.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that Energy Transfer Partners continued to build the Dakota Access Pipeline and accepted a $50,000 daily fine is not sufficiently substantiated by the evidence provided. The statement released by ETP does not confirm they continued construction despite the denial of the easement; it only expresses their intention to complete the project without rerouting. Furthermore, there is no verified evidence provided regarding the payment of a $50,000 daily fine. The rumor of continued construction and the fine appears to be speculative and lacks concrete evidence or official confirmation."}

It\u2019s literally just another car in the garage.\u201dAs of January 23 2020, the post featured what appeared to be flair added by a moderator (not the original person who posted the claim.) That read, \u201cProb fake but w\/e,\u201d meaning \u201cprobably fake, but whatever.\u201d The post, which was submitted by u\/dorf-1, received more than 50,000 upvotes. In the comments, fellow redditors predictably debated the legality of the purported email, such as:A top comment on the thread advised the original poster to cross-post the image to various finance-related subreddits, where a very well-regarded piece of advice is to pay for a \u201cbeater\u201d in cash and \u201cdrive it until the wheels fall off,\u201d eliminating a car payment from your budget. Many others chimed in with their own anecdotes:Oh my fucking God, you should share this on r\/personalfinance r\/financialindependence or r\/daveramsey and watch people lose their absolute shit. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with having a beater commuter car. It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to begin hoarding money for investing.Honestly, keeping a fully paid off functional car for as long as possible is one of the most financially responsible things a person can do.Perhaps the second most common theme in the comments involved assertions that the letter was \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cnever happened,\u201d or that it was a blatant attempt at \u201ckarma farming\u201d (baiting fellow redditors with compelling and sometimes fake content solely to accrue upvotes. )When one commenter asked the original poster if they had possibly been taken in by a phony email, they claimed to have seen it on a work computer:It\u2019s legit. I personally saw the email on his screen, and he clicked the from name to show the email address under it. Knowing those two VPs, I totally believe it.A January 23 2020 article about the viral letter on car-focused site Jalopnik (which, incidentally, maintains a strong editorial stance in favor of owning and maintaining older vehicles) noted in its headline that the claim might be fake. A piece titled \u201cThat Awful Email About An Employee\u2019s Old Car May Not Be Real But I Still Cannot Abide\u201d begins:I should preface this all by saying that I\u2019ve yet to be able to absolutely confirm that this absurd email is real, though the original poster insists that it is. Fundamentally, it\u2019s just a boring email from an HR department to an employee, but the content of the email is deeply insulting, reflecting the worst aspects of modern life, socioeconomic realities, culture, and perhaps even capitalism itself. And, of course, like all things that really matter, it\u2019s about a car.Its author, Jason Torchinsky, goes on to explain that \u201cafter seeing this posted and re-posted all over the place, in car-centric sites and otherwise, I\u2019m not sure if whether or not this email is real or not is what matters \u2026 [w]hat\u2019s important to note here is the reaction it\u2019s generated, which speaks volumes about our relationship with our cars.\u201d\u00a0Torchinsky maintains that the screenshot could be a hoax for the sake of Reddit popularity, but adds:What\u2019s especially remarkable about this email is how well it enrages both people who couldn\u2019t tell a Toyota from a toenail and genuine hardcore gearheads, who chafe at the very idea that anyone should tell you what to drive. [\u2026]Everything about this email is revolting. The suggestion of enforced conformity, the mindless adherence to idiotic concepts of socioeconomic status and wealth displays, the inherent fear and distrust of people who may be less financially sound, the unsolicited advice, a company trying to police someone\u2019s private life, this whole thing is just a colossal shit cocktail with a turd on a toothpick as a garnish.Given that the original poster did not provide any verifiable details and was unlikely to do so, there was no way to determine whether a company\u2019s HR department emailed an employee about their 2005 Toyota and pressured him to unnecessarily purchase a new vehicle.

This is to ensure that the employee can be trusted to make sound financial decisions, has the maturity to manage his\/her own financial affairs, and to show signs of financial distress that might indicate risk of theft or fraud. While we do not conduct these checks at this time the gist of the check is valid to us.We have noticed for some time the condition of your vehicle and wanted to discuss the matter with you. We will follow up this email with a personal meeting but wanted to document the discussion beforehand.Since of course your annual salary is known to us and a newer and more appropriate looking vehicle should be within your financial reach, it is our concern that perhaps you are having a difficult time financially. Frankly the concern is that if you cannot afford a newer vehicle then either you may be susceptible to fraud or that you are not responsible for the position you maintain. To be even more frank, it just looks bad.Please let us know if there is a reason that you have not upgraded your vehicle before now. If it is a financial matter then we will need to know the details of the problems you are having. Perhaps it is as simple that you did not know the concern you are raising. Otherwise please address this situation as quickly as possible. We will be happy to refer you to dealerships who we have worked with in the past.Sincerely, [Redacted] Vice President, Human Resource Management[Redacted] Vice President, Finance and AdministrationAn original source for the claim appeared to Reddit\u2019s r\/trashy, from a post on the same date with the title, \u201cThis email my coworker received today. He drives a 2005 Camry. It\u2019s not wrecked, just old and fading paint. He never has to meet anyone that they would ever see the car. It\u2019s literally just another car in the garage.\u201dAs of January 23 2020, the post featured what appeared to be flair added by a moderator (not the original person who posted the claim.) That read, \u201cProb fake but w\/e,\u201d meaning \u201cprobably fake, but whatever.\u201d The post, which was submitted by u\/dorf-1, received more than 50,000 upvotes. In the comments, fellow redditors predictably debated the legality of the purported email, such as:A top comment on the thread advised the original poster to cross-post the image to various finance-related subreddits, where a very well-regarded piece of advice is to pay for a \u201cbeater\u201d in cash and \u201cdrive it until the wheels fall off,\u201d eliminating a car payment from your budget. Many others chimed in with their own anecdotes:Oh my fucking God, you should share this on r\/personalfinance r\/financialindependence or r\/daveramsey and watch people lose their absolute shit. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with having a beater commuter car. It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to begin hoarding money for investing.Honestly, keeping a fully paid off functional car for as long as possible is one of the most financially responsible things a person can do.Perhaps the second most common theme in the comments involved assertions that the letter was \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cnever happened,\u201d or that it was a blatant attempt at \u201ckarma farming\u201d (baiting fellow redditors with compelling and sometimes fake content solely to accrue upvotes. )When one commenter asked the original poster if they had possibly been taken in by a phony email, they claimed to have seen it on a work computer:It\u2019s legit. I personally saw the email on his screen, and he clicked the from name to show the email address under it. Knowing those two VPs, I totally believe it.A January 23 2020 article about the viral letter on car-focused site Jalopnik (which, incidentally, maintains a strong editorial stance in favor of owning and maintaining older vehicles) noted in its headline that the claim might be fake. A piece titled \u201cThat Awful Email About An Employee\u2019s Old Car May Not Be Real But I Still Cannot Abide\u201d begins:I should preface this all by saying that I\u2019ve yet to be able to absolutely confirm that this absurd email is real, though the original poster insists that it is. Fundamentally, it\u2019s just a boring email from an HR department to an employee, but the content of the email is deeply insulting, reflecting the worst aspects of modern life, socioeconomic realities, culture, and perhaps even capitalism itself. And, of course, like all things that really matter, it\u2019s about a car.Its author, Jason Torchinsky, goes on to explain that \u201cafter seeing this posted and re-posted all over the place, in car-centric sites and otherwise, I\u2019m not sure if whether or not this email is real or not is what matters \u2026 [w]hat\u2019s important to note here is the reaction it\u2019s generated, which speaks volumes about our relationship with our cars.\u201d\u00a0Torchinsky maintains that the screenshot could be a hoax for the sake of Reddit popularity, but adds:What\u2019s especially remarkable about this email is how well it enrages both people who couldn\u2019t tell a Toyota from a toenail and genuine hardcore gearheads, who chafe at the very idea that anyone should tell you what to drive. [\u2026]Everything about this email is revolting. The suggestion of enforced conformity, the mindless adherence to idiotic concepts of socioeconomic status and wealth displays, the inherent fear and distrust of people who may be less financially sound, the unsolicited advice, a company trying to police someone\u2019s private life, this whole thing is just a colossal shit cocktail with a turd on a toothpick as a garnish.Given that the original poster did not provide any verifiable details and was unlikely to do so, there was no way to determine whether a company\u2019s HR department emailed an employee about their 2005 Toyota and pressured him to unnecessarily purchase a new vehicle. As others noted, it seemed possible but perhaps not plausible a company would commit such an ethically dubious request to writing. What\u2019s more, the post\u2019s many upvotes demonstrated motive to falsify the story for karma. The purported recipient of the email had not, as of January 23 2020, stepped forward to attempt to corroborate the claim.The fact that this is realistic enough to be at all believable, however, speaks volumes.n\nClaim: \"Image shows a \"\"letter from HR\"\" (human resources), essentially threatening a company employee to purchase a new vehicle or face workplace discipline.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence provided does not offer conclusive proof that the screenshot of the HR letter is authentic. Doubts are raised by sources like Jalopnik and Reddit moderators, suggesting it could be a hoax aimed at generating Reddit karma. While the content of the letter appears realistic and plausible, the lack of verifiable details and the absence of confirmation from the purported recipient of the email make it impossible to definitively verify the authenticity of the letter. Therefore, there is not enough information to confirm if the claim that the image shows a genuine HR letter is true."}

{"claim_id":34659,"hypothesis":"\"A \"\"female physician in Munich\"\" penned an alarming warning letter about refugees.\"","date_published":"October 19, 2015","explanation_1":"Variations: The name of Dr. Barbara Sziraki has since become attached to this message, but she appears to be a Los Angeles psychologist who simply forwarded the letter via e-mail and not a Czech physician working in Germany.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 8 October 2015, the web site\u00a0The Right Scoop published the above-reproduced missive as an article headlined \u201cMUST WATCH: Whistleblower Doctor Explains HORRIFIC Reality Dealing with Muslim Invaders in Germany\u201d \u2014 not long afterwards, verbatim versions of the same commentary began circulating in an e-mail frequently titled \u201cA Female Physician in Munich, Germany Sends a Warning Message to The World\u2026\u201d The Right Scoop claimed credit for transcribing the letter from the video embedded above; but whether that translation is an accurate one is unclear. A longer version of the same clip was uploaded to YouTube on 6 October 2015, and both clips began with what appeared to be repetition of an older rumor involving refugees and Oktoberfest. The source of the missive was apparently an on-air reading by a Czech newscaster, who recited what was said to be a letter from a Czech doctor treating immigrants in a German hospital. Its assertions were a blend of difficult-to-verify first-person claims and opinion (mixed with a measure of undiluted misinformation), its purported author was an unnamed \u201cfemale physician,\u201d and a handful of its talking points were claims about incidents at an unidentified Munich hospital in the weeks following an influx of Middle Eastern refugees to Germany in September 2015. (The piece was almost certainly veiled criticism of German citizens who had welcomed asylum-seekers with open arms a few weeks prior to its circulation.) Like earlier polemics written from the perspective of an\u00a0authority figure, the occupation of the writer served to bolster the e-mail\u2019s claims and lend credibility to them \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to imagine the item\u2019s gaining such traction had it been the perspective of a barista or dog walker. The claims contained in the letter were not dated (making it easier for them to circulate in perpetuity), so verifying even the scant collection of non-opinion statements offered in the e-mail is difficult. In its first portion the writer claimed that \u201cMuslims\u201d had \u201crefused\u201d to be treated by female doctors (and that \u201cand, we, women, are refusing to go among those animals, especially from Africa\u201d):  Many migrants have AIDS, syphilis, open TB and many exotic diseases that we, in Europe, do not know how to treat them. If they receive a prescription in the pharmacy, they learn they have to pay cash. This leads to unbelievable outbursts, especially when it is about drugs for the children. They abandon the children with pharmacy staff with the words: So, cure them here yourselves! So the police are not just guarding the clinics and hospitals, but also large pharmacies. AIDS, syphilis, and tuberculosis are hardly diseases modern doctors would consider \u201cexotic,\u201d and it beggars belief that anyone (particularly a \u201cphysician\u201d) would claim medical professionals \u201cdon\u2019t know how to treat them.\u201d There\u2019s some truth to the assertion Muslim men might eschew care from female doctors, as a 2010 New York Times article explained:  People who are non-mahram adults of the opposite sex are prohibited from being alone together in a closed place where sexual intercourse could occur or where even such an accusation could be made, [Dr. Aasim I.] Padela said. A prophetic tradition states that when a non-mahram woman and man are alone together, Satan is the \u201cthird among them,\u201d Dr. Padela noted, so the laws prohibit not only adultery but \u201cproximity\u201d to adultery. As a result, Muslim men, too, may be reluctant to be cared for by female physicians. However, that same piece also covered the larger issue of patient comfort and bedside manner; and open contempt for patients (as expressed by the putative author of the letter from a Munich hospital) is unusual in medical settings, where most doctors and nurses are accustomed to providing care to all, whether or not those interactions are pleasant. The Munich physician\u2019s letter also stated:  Until now, the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.2 million. Now it will be at least 3.5 million. Most of these people are completely unemployable. A bare minimum of them have any education. What is more, their women usually do not work at all. I estimate that one in ten is pregnant. Hundreds of thousands of them have brought along infants and little kids under six, many emaciated and neglected.

I went to Germany, not to Africa or the Middle East. As of July 2015 there were an estimated 2.8 million people registered as unemployed in Germany, and the author didn\u2019t cite any\u00a0source for predictions\u00a0that number would rise to 3.5 million based on an influx of asylum seekers. The \u201cone in 10 is pregnant\u201d figure is an admitted estimation by the e-mail\u2019s writer, for which we could find no corroborating evidence (and it further stands to reason that pregnant refugees would seek medical care with higher frequency than women in general, for obvious reasons). However, it should be noted that that overall claim deviated significantly from other popular refugee rumors which consistently\u00a0described those seeking asylum as predominantly men of \u201cfighting age.\u201d The missive went on to state:  For now, the local hospital staff has not come down with the diseases they brought here, but, with so many hundreds of patients every day \u2014 this is just a question of time. In a hospital near the Rhine, migrants attacked the staff with knives after they had handed over an 8-month-old on the brink of death, which they had dragged across half of Europe for three months. The child died in two days, despite having received top care at one of the best pediatric clinics in Germany. The physician had to undergo surgery and two nurses are laid up in the ICU. Nobody has been punished. The notion that spikes in immigration lead to outbreaks of disease is a common theme among rumors that circulate during crises that drive large numbers of people out of a given area. Media speculation about such public health concerns inevitably follows; but (as the author conceded) those predictions have not come to pass in connection with Syrian refugees. We were unable to find any news reports that any hospital workers near the Rhine had been attacked by refugees at any point in 2015 in the manner described by the author. The e-mail continued by stating:  The local press is forbidden to write about it, so we know about it through email. What would have happened to a German if he had stabbed a doctor and nurses with a knife? Or if he had flung his own syphilis-infected urine into a nurse\u2019s face and so threatened her with infection? At a minimum he\u2019d go straight to jail and later to court. With these people, so far, nothing has happened. Precisely what \u201cit\u201d the \u201clocal press [was]\u00a0forbidden\u201d to report was left to the reader\u2019s preconceptions (presumably the alleged attacks on medical personnel by immigrants); but news coverage about the ongoing refugee crisis wasn\u2019t subject to any blackout or other restriction (as attested to by comprehensive global news coverage of the situation). The author seemed to hint that similar e-mails were\u00a0the source for the claims, accounts\u00a0that proliferate on social media but don\u2019t appear in the news. However, the reason for the absence of such accounts from the news media is far more likely their dubious credibility than any sort of censorship of reporting, which itself creates a self-propelling narrative of widespread suppression. The author of this missive concluded:  And so I ask, where are all those greeters and receivers from the train stations? Sitting pretty at home, enjoying their non-profits and looking forward to more trains and their next batch of cash from acting like greeters at the stations. The writer seems to suggest as a footnote that the crowds of Germans who warmly received refugees weeks earlier were paid by unnamed parties, insinuating \u00a0that the sole motivation for their display of welcome was financial. As it stands, no one has stepped forward to claim authorship of the popular polemic; and a number of its assertions are shaky, unsupported, or simply opinion-based (such as the repeated description\u00a0of African people as \u201canimals\u201d).

A longer version of the same clip was uploaded to YouTube on 6 October 2015, and both clips began with what appeared to be repetition of an older rumor involving refugees and Oktoberfest. The source of the missive was apparently an on-air reading by a Czech newscaster, who recited what was said to be a letter from a Czech doctor treating immigrants in a German hospital. Its assertions were a blend of difficult-to-verify first-person claims and opinion (mixed with a measure of undiluted misinformation), its purported author was an unnamed \u201cfemale physician,\u201d and a handful of its talking points were claims about incidents at an unidentified Munich hospital in the weeks following an influx of Middle Eastern refugees to Germany in September 2015. (The piece was almost certainly veiled criticism of German citizens who had welcomed asylum-seekers with open arms a few weeks prior to its circulation.) Like earlier polemics written from the perspective of an\u00a0authority figure, the occupation of the writer served to bolster the e-mail\u2019s claims and lend credibility to them \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to imagine the item\u2019s gaining such traction had it been the perspective of a barista or dog walker. The claims contained in the letter were not dated (making it easier for them to circulate in perpetuity), so verifying even the scant collection of non-opinion statements offered in the e-mail is difficult. In its first portion the writer claimed that \u201cMuslims\u201d had \u201crefused\u201d to be treated by female doctors (and that \u201cand, we, women, are refusing to go among those animals, especially from Africa\u201d):  Many migrants have AIDS, syphilis, open TB and many exotic diseases that we, in Europe, do not know how to treat them. If they receive a prescription in the pharmacy, they learn they have to pay cash. This leads to unbelievable outbursts, especially when it is about drugs for the children. They abandon the children with pharmacy staff with the words: So, cure them here yourselves! So the police are not just guarding the clinics and hospitals, but also large pharmacies. AIDS, syphilis, and tuberculosis are hardly diseases modern doctors would consider \u201cexotic,\u201d and it beggars belief that anyone (particularly a \u201cphysician\u201d) would claim medical professionals \u201cdon\u2019t know how to treat them.\u201d There\u2019s some truth to the assertion Muslim men might eschew care from female doctors, as a 2010 New York Times article explained:  People who are non-mahram adults of the opposite sex are prohibited from being alone together in a closed place where sexual intercourse could occur or where even such an accusation could be made, [Dr. Aasim I.] Padela said. A prophetic tradition states that when a non-mahram woman and man are alone together, Satan is the \u201cthird among them,\u201d Dr. Padela noted, so the laws prohibit not only adultery but \u201cproximity\u201d to adultery. As a result, Muslim men, too, may be reluctant to be cared for by female physicians. However, that same piece also covered the larger issue of patient comfort and bedside manner; and open contempt for patients (as expressed by the putative author of the letter from a Munich hospital) is unusual in medical settings, where most doctors and nurses are accustomed to providing care to all, whether or not those interactions are pleasant. The Munich physician\u2019s letter also stated:  Until now, the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.2 million. Now it will be at least 3.5 million. Most of these people are completely unemployable. A bare minimum of them have any education. What is more, their women usually do not work at all. I estimate that one in ten is pregnant. Hundreds of thousands of them have brought along infants and little kids under six, many emaciated and neglected. If this continues and German re-opens its borders, I\u2019m going home to the Czech Republic. Nobody can keep me here in this situation, not even double the salary than at home.

The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene.The folks in the lab finally figured out what it was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise. It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields. Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners. The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver\u2019s remains were not recovered; however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel. Maybe it\u2019s the Wile E. Coyote-ness of it all, the \u201cso real you can almost touch it\u201d mental image of a smoldering wreck sticking out of a cliff face.

Or maybe it\u2019s a simple matter of cars and the men who love them, the eternal love affair. Whatever. The boys love it, and that\u2019s all that matters. This tale of vehicular velocity ferocity has been popular among servicemen since the late 1970s. In those early word-of-mouth versions, the JATO was taken from a cargo plane or out of a warehouse on base, thereby answering a key question left up in the air in later versions: Where did the intrepid lad obtain the engine?

The car was last seen going end over end across San Francisco bay. Another reader heard it in 1964 while stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

Various communities have attempted to ban this form of fashion statement.

The practice, which did begin in prisons, worked its way from the hoosegow into hip hop culture.

Sagging can even be taken a step further by wearing the droopy breeches backwards. (Totally Krossed Out, the 1992 debut album of Kriss Kross, shows the pair of 13-year-old rappers doing this.)

One guy said he was told that this started in prison with the gay prisoner doing that to show that they are ready for a sexual relationship with whoever is interested. [Collected on the Internet, 2003] A friend told me recently that the \u201cgang\u201d style of baggy pants showing your underwear (called \u201cjailin\u201d) was originally a prison code signifying that the man wearing them was willing to be, er, the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d of some other man\/men. [Collected on the Internet, August 2011] To all you guys who \u201csag\u201d your pants and show your butt and underwear \u2026did you know it originated in prison? It was a signal to the other MEN that you are \u201cavailable\u201d. So if you wanna keep going around looking like you\u2019re \u201cavailable\u201d for another dude to \u201ctap that\u201d then keep thinking your cool while I think you look like a Fool!!! BTW it\u2019s called \u2013 PBS (Prison B*tch Syndrome).LOL Pass this on to the droopy pants that you know. Sagging pants became the behind-the-bars thing thanks to ill-fitting prison-issue garb: some of those incarcerated were provided with clothing a few sizes too large. That oversizing, coupled with the lack of belts in the big house, led to a great number of jailbirds whose pants were falling off their arses. (Belts are not permitted in most correctional facilities because all too often the lifeless bodies of their inmate owners have been found hanging from them.) Sagging has another rumored origin (also false), one less well-traveled than the \u201cgay inmates advertising for sex\u201d postulation:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] What\u2019s the origin of Gang-banger pants? You know, worn really low and baggy? Before they became a fashion statement, and\/or MADE that way by assorted clothing companies, I heard it originated in a prison: An inmate was on suicide watch and couldn\u2019t have his belt, which the other inmates were either outraged by or thought was ridiculous given the inmate in question. So they started wearing theirs really low in protest\/solidarity. Anyway, that\u2019s what I heard. Another discredited theory says ghetto hoodlums adopted the fashion of wearing their pants in the sagging style to better conceal weapons from rival gang members and police. While it is true a gun or knife can be effectively stashed out of sight in droopy pants, it can also be hidden in more form-fitting bottoms, especially when the pants-wearer tops his cache with an untucked sports jersey, pullover, or sweatshirt. The most intriguing aspect of the \u201ctrolling for gay sex\u201d rumor lies not in its veracity, but in its acceptance as gospel by those who encounter it and who are then moved to pass it along to others. While the combination of two facts (homosexuality in prison and falling-down pants worn by inmates) accounts for the origin of the belief that links the one to the other, its spread is attributable to the prevailing dislike of the fashion. Those who choose to wear their pants this way cite comfort as their motive and so find justification for this imitation of rap stars and felons, two groups perceived as toughly self-sufficient and therefore worthy of emulation; those who do not follow this fashion see only the crotches of jeans hanging at or above the knee, hobbling their wearers in a goofy manner. (One can walk in sagging pants. But one can\u2019t run in them.) The rumor becomes a way of passing along one group\u2019s disdain for another\u2019s sartorial practice. Communicating that the saggers are unwittingly offering their backsides to all takers when they think they are mimicking admired rappers and identifying with tough guys no sensible person would mess with becomes a way of saying \u201cThe joke is really on them.\u201d This same sense of surreptitious delight over being in on a prank someone looked down upon is unknowingly playing on himself fuels another urban legend that involves medallions flaunted by society matrons or Chinese character-emblazoned sweaters proudly worn by their knitters and even some of the \u201cmisunderstood souvenir\u201d tales told about globe-trotting tourists.","sources":" ","label":2,"subjects":"Risqu\u00e9 Business, homosexuality","__index_level_0__":7269,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nSagging, the fashion of wearing pants with their waistbands around the hips (or lower) rather than snugged to the midriff, has been and continues to be a controversial style of dress.

[Collected on the Internet, 2003] A friend told me recently that the \u201cgang\u201d style of baggy pants showing your underwear (called \u201cjailin\u201d) was originally a prison code signifying that the man wearing them was willing to be, er, the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d of some other man\/men. [Collected on the Internet, August 2011] To all you guys who \u201csag\u201d your pants and show your butt and underwear \u2026did you know it originated in prison? It was a signal to the other MEN that you are \u201cavailable\u201d. So if you wanna keep going around looking like you\u2019re \u201cavailable\u201d for another dude to \u201ctap that\u201d then keep thinking your cool while I think you look like a Fool!!! BTW it\u2019s called \u2013 PBS (Prison B*tch Syndrome).LOL Pass this on to the droopy pants that you know. Sagging pants became the behind-the-bars thing thanks to ill-fitting prison-issue garb: some of those incarcerated were provided with clothing a few sizes too large. That oversizing, coupled with the lack of belts in the big house, led to a great number of jailbirds whose pants were falling off their arses. (Belts are not permitted in most correctional facilities because all too often the lifeless bodies of their inmate owners have been found hanging from them.) Sagging has another rumored origin (also false), one less well-traveled than the \u201cgay inmates advertising for sex\u201d postulation:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] What\u2019s the origin of Gang-banger pants? You know, worn really low and baggy? Before they became a fashion statement, and\/or MADE that way by assorted clothing companies, I heard it originated in a prison: An inmate was on suicide watch and couldn\u2019t have his belt, which the other inmates were either outraged by or thought was ridiculous given the inmate in question. So they started wearing theirs really low in protest\/solidarity. Anyway, that\u2019s what I heard. Another discredited theory says ghetto hoodlums adopted the fashion of wearing their pants in the sagging style to better conceal weapons from rival gang members and police. While it is true a gun or knife can be effectively stashed out of sight in droopy pants, it can also be hidden in more form-fitting bottoms, especially when the pants-wearer tops his cache with an untucked sports jersey, pullover, or sweatshirt. The most intriguing aspect of the \u201ctrolling for gay sex\u201d rumor lies not in its veracity, but in its acceptance as gospel by those who encounter it and who are then moved to pass it along to others. While the combination of two facts (homosexuality in prison and falling-down pants worn by inmates) accounts for the origin of the belief that links the one to the other, its spread is attributable to the prevailing dislike of the fashion. Those who choose to wear their pants this way cite comfort as their motive and so find justification for this imitation of rap stars and felons, two groups perceived as toughly self-sufficient and therefore worthy of emulation; those who do not follow this fashion see only the crotches of jeans hanging at or above the knee, hobbling their wearers in a goofy manner. (One can walk in sagging pants. But one can\u2019t run in them.) The rumor becomes a way of passing along one group\u2019s disdain for another\u2019s sartorial practice. Communicating that the saggers are unwittingly offering their backsides to all takers when they think they are mimicking admired rappers and identifying with tough guys no sensible person would mess with becomes a way of saying \u201cThe joke is really on them.\u201d This same sense of surreptitious delight over being in on a prank someone looked down upon is unknowingly playing on himself fuels another urban legend that involves medallions flaunted by society matrons or Chinese character-emblazoned sweaters proudly worn by their knitters and even some of the \u201cmisunderstood souvenir\u201d tales told about globe-trotting tourists.n\nClaim: The fashion of sagging one's pants was born of a prison mode of signaling sexual availability.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence provided debunks the claim that sagging was originally a prison code for signaling sexual availability. While it is true that the style originated in prisons due to oversizing of clothes and lack of belts, leading to unintentionally sagging pants, the specific claim that it was a signal for sexual availability is identified as a rumor with no factual basis. Additionally, the text explains that the theory was discredited and is more about the spread of an urban legend fueled by disdain for the fashion rather than based on factual origins."}

The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine.

It was coming from American Action Forum, a self-described \"\"center-right policy institute.\"\" The organization put out an analysis on Oct. 27 titled: \"\"Health Care Providers are Opting-Out of Obamacare Exchange Plans.\"\" How many? According to the post, \"\"as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products.\"\" It went on to list some reasons \"\"doctors are opting out of the exchange plans.\"\" That\u2019s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans. But there is no evidence to suggest the number is anywhere near 214,000.

Of course, we were curious, too, so we got to checking. Before we get to our findings, here's a little context about CNSNews.com for those \u2013 like us \u2013 who had not heard of it. CNSNews.com, based in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., says its goal is to \"\"provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission.\"\" It is not affiliated with Catholic News Service, which sometimes uses the same CNS abbreviation. First, we checked the larger context of the article to see if \"\"Obamacare\"\" (the Affordable Care Act) requires health insurers to cover sterilization. We made several calls before we finally came up with a solid source that confirmed the new law requires providers to cover sterilization without cost to the patient. According to the U.S. Health Resource and Services Administration, services that fall under \"\"women's preventive health care\"\" are supposed to be covered for free, including mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, contraception, sexually transmitted infection counseling and \u2013 yes \u2013\"\"sterilization procedures.\"\" As for the more salient detail \u2013 the age of consent in Oregon \u2013 we found a piece of Oregon law, which states that \"\"a minor 15 years of age or older may give consent, without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor, to: Hospital care, medical or surgical diagnosis or treatment by a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board \u2026\"\"  Essentially, CNSNews.com linked those two pieces of information \u2013 the new requirements that insurance companies cover sterilization for free and the fact that Oregon's age of consent for health care is 15 years old. The idea that 15-year-old girls would be lining up for free on-demand sterilizations struck our readers either as scary - \"\"Is this true?\"\" - or ridiculous - \"\"This can't be true.\"\" We kept reporting. We checked whether sterilization had always been covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state-run health care insurance program that covers 600,000 people a month. We called Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Alissa Robbins, who confirmed that it has been included since the plan's inception in 1994. We also asked how many 15-, 16 \u2013 and 17-year-olds had received sterilizations under the plan. Robbins checked records for the last 10 years and found no sterilization procedure for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old. As for 17-year-olds, she said, at most one such procedure is performed each year, though some years none is performed. She couldn't tell us the reason, she said, because it was \"\"protected health information.\"\" However, it seems clear to us that the procedure for young women in that age bracket is exceedingly rare. Robbins also pointed us to ORS 436, which lays out the warnings and consent procedures for anyone seeking sterilization, including minors. If a physician feels a minor is not capable of making an informed consent to be sterilized, her only recourse is to go to court and ask a judge to order that she is. We also checked with OHSU Hospital to see what the process would be for a minor looking to be sterilized there. Spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley got back to us with a lengthy email. For any patient under 30, she said, the hospital offers counseling about \"\"long-acting reversible contraceptives\"\" and \"\"the risk of regret\"\" in young women who are sterilized. The \"\"most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization,\"\" she wrote, \"\"is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening.\"\" If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. \"\"(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent.\"\" She ended on this note: \"\"The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient. It requires that insurance plans cover all contraceptives available.\"\" After some vacation phone tag, we were able to talk to Michael Chapman, the CNSNews.com managing editor who had worked closely with the story's author, an intern who is no longer there. \"\"Our story is factual,\"\" Chapman said. \"\"Out story reports what the law is in Oregon and it reports what the federal regulation is.\"\" Chapman said the article was stymied in part by little response from the Oregon Health Authority. \"\"It's great they're willing to say more now that the story has come out. \"\"Nearly all health insurers must provide sterilization ... that's a fact.\"\" In a subsequent email, Chapman pointed out language on the Oregon Health Authority's consent to sterilization form that reads \"\"I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me.\"\" The form is the last step in many checks and balances that is only signed after the patient finds a physician willing to perform the procedure.

Providers consider medical necessity and ethical implications, and often require counseling or additional consent processes before proceeding with such a significant medical procedure.

{"claim_id":31998,"hypothesis":"A new analysis of the residue on common American foods showed high levels of the herbicide glyphosate and Monsanto, the EPA, and the FDA are in cahoots to silence word of the chemical\u2019s harmful effects and its high concentration in foods.","date_published":"November 16, 2016","explanation_1":"NOTE: This story has been updated based on discussions with a number of scientists in the field.

For more information on that ruling, and how it relates to glyphosate residue in food, please read our August 2018\u00a0explainer on that case. On 15 November 2016, the natural food evangelist and alternative health guru known as the Food Babe posted a report from a natural food activist group named Food Democracy Now that alleged to demonstrate common American foods contain high levels of glyphosate, a chemical in Monsanto\u2019s RoundUp herbicide and the most prevalent weed-killer on the planet. Her post and the report it highlights are a new addition to the contentious political debate about the chemical\u2019s harm to humans and the environment, as well as the potential influence of large companies like Monsanto on regulatory agencies, that has been ongoing for decades. Glyphosate is widely applied to crops around the world \u2014 especially genetically modified crops specifically bred to be resistant to the chemical, per the National Pesticide Information Center: Glyphosate is an herbicide. It is applied to the leaves of plants to kill both broadleaf plants and grasses. The sodium salt form of glyphosate is used to regulate plant growth and ripen fruit. Glyphosate was first registered for use in the U.S. in 1974. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States. People apply it in agriculture and forestry, on lawns and gardens, and for weeds in industrial areas. Some products containing glyphosate control aquatic plants. Regulatory agencies have gone back and forth on its safety ever since it was registered for use. The idea, which has been verified by\u00a0observations, is that glyphosate runs off into the water supply, where it can be ingested directly, or consumed after it leaves a residue on food. The first assessment of glyphosate\u2019s carcinogenic potential was undertaken by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1985. Based on studies done primarily with rodents, they classified the chemical as \u201ca Group C (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with limited animal evidence and little or no human data) carcinogen\u201d in 1986. After a series of additional investigations, which included industry sponsored studies, the EPA reclassified the chemical in 1993 as \u201cGroup E carcinogen (signifies evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans).\u201d A majority of the data used to demonstrate evidence of harm comes from studies in which environmentally unrealistic concentrations of glyphosate were exposed to rats, mice, and fish. Some recent studies have demonstrated potentially\u00a0adverse effects at low exposure levels but the validity of these results have been called into question by other researchers. Although a March 2015 review by the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer suggested glyphosate may have some carcinogenic potential, the current consensus amongst the world\u2019s regulatory agencies is that it is safe for consumption and non-carcinogenic at environmentally relevant levels, with the WHO concluding: Glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet. Still, a 2014 report from the US Government Accountability Office compelled the FDA to set up an initiative to monitor food for glyphosate residue, a decision met by praise by environmentalists and food activists. As reported by the Huffington Post\u2019s Carey Gillam, however, the effort was halted due to a lack of agreement on standardizing the analyses: The FDA\u2019s residue testing for glyphosate was combined with a broader herbicides analysis program the FDA set in motion in February of this year. But the glyphosate testing has been particularly challenging for the FDA. The agency was finally forced to put the glyphosate residue testing part of the work plan on hold amid confusion, disagreement and difficulties with establishing a standard methodology to use across the agency\u2019s multiple U.S. laboratories, according to FDA sources. Equipment issues have also been a problem, with some labs citing a need for more sensitive instruments, sources within FDA said. This is where the Food Babe\u2019s unsubstantiated narrative comes into the picture. Based primarily on the fact that the FDA canceled its residue testing program, along with results from various studies performed on animals, she alleges a nefarious connection between the FDA and Monsanto, the developer of the RoundUp: When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn\u2019t like the results they started getting \u2013 especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye. While there are conflicts of interest arguments to be made about the use of industry sponsored studies or petitions to influence regulators, there is no evidence to suggest the FDA halted its testing program in response to pressure from Monsanto. Instead of providing evidence of the alleged connection, the Food Babe presented the results of non-peer reviewed lab tests performed on various food items at the behest of the activist group Food Democracy Now and the research platform The Detox Project, alleging it exposed high levels of the herbicide on common foods: A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto\u2019s Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts. Just to give you an idea of how outrageous these amounts are, independent research shows that probable harm to human health begins at really low levels of exposure \u2013 at only 0.1 ppb of glyphosate. Many foods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulators throughout the world consider \u201csafe\u201d. The statement about 0.1 ppb being the lower limit for harm to human health is controversial, as only one of the studies listed as providing support for that claim actually tested an amount that low; the test was performed on mice, not humans, and it used the word \u201cpotential\u201d, not \u201cprobable\u201d. It is also important to note that many of the results they reported are actually marked with the note that they\u00a0\u201cmay not represent an accurate representation of the sample.\u201d The lab\u00a0results commissioned by Food Democracy Now claimed to show residue values on common American foods that were well above 0.1 ppb; but the methods employed are not elucidated, and its important to remember that the FDA limit is four orders of magnitude greater than the threshold they claim. A final point to note is that the report was commissioned by two groups with a stated agenda, as declared in its introduction: The testing and analysis was performed at the request of FOOD DEMOCRACY NOW!, in coordination with THE DETOX PROJECT, which gathered additional scientific evidence from around the world and included a compendium of independent research on glyphosate. According to their website, \u201cFood Democracy Now! is a grassroots community dedicated to building a sustainable food system that protects our natural environment, sustains farmers and nourishes families.\u201d The Detox Project is a research initiative that is currently focused specifically on glyphosate, according to their mission statement: Glyphosate, the world\u2019s most used herbicide, is the first chemical being tested by The Detox Project. We aim to study all of the most common man-made chemicals in our environment over the next few years [\u2026] to protect women and children from the harmful effects of man-made chemicals in our food and in our environment. There is no evidence to suggest the FDA shut down its residue program due to complaints from Monsanto.

The real story took place in January 1957, when Buddy Holly, having failed to achieve success as a recording artist for Decca Records (his first two singles had flopped, and the company had dropped his contract at the end of 1956), decided to give an independent New Mexico record producer named Norman Petty a shot at producing some recordings and promoting them to record companies. When Buddy and his group returned to Petty\u2019s studio for their second recording session on 24 February 1957, Buddy had decided that, in additional to taping a new composition of his entitled \u201cI\u2019m Looking for Someone to Love,\u201d he would have another try at performing a tune he had initially recorded for Decca the previous year, a song called \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day.\u201d  After the session, Petty chose the tape of this newer, speeded-up version of \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d as the song he would pitch to his recording industry contacts as a potential single. A very large obstacle loomed in the path of their plans, however: Buddy\u2019s contract with Decca prohibited him from rerecording any of the material from his Decca sessions for a period of five years, and this prohibition included the song \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d (even though Decca had declined to issue it on a record). It was Norman Petty who reportedly came up with the idea that if \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d were issued under the name of a group rather than under Buddy\u2019s name alone, Decca might not realize that the vocalist was a solo artist the label had once signed and dumped. Buddy and his bandmates (Jerry Allison and Niki Sullivan) were left to come up with a suitable group name, and inspired by the Spiders, one of Buddy\u2019s favorite rhythm-and-blues groups, they started flipping through the \u201cInsects\u201d section of an encyclopedia at J.I. Allison\u2019s house, as recounted by Niki Sullivan in the biography Remembering Buddy:  We were at Jerry\u2019s house, and everything we thought of [for a band name] had been used or didn\u2019t fit. So Jerry got an encyclopedia, and somehow we got started on insects. There was a whole page of bugs. We thought about grasshopper and quickly passed that over. And we did consider the name Beetles, but Jerry said, \u2018Aw, that\u2019s just a bug you\u2019d want to step on,\u2019 so we immediately dropped that. Then Jerry came up with the idea of the Crickets. He said, \u2018Well, you know, they make a happy sound, they\u2019re a happy type of insect.\u2019 I remember him saying, too, \u2018They make music by rubbing their legs together,\u2019 and that cracked us up. So we kept going and tried some other names, but finally we settled on the Crickets. The ruse took an ironic turn when Norman Petty, unsuccessful at pitching Buddy Holly\u2019s new version of \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d to several record companies, finally received a positive response from Bob Thiele, the head of A&R (artists and repertoire) at Coral Records. Since Coral was the home to such \u201cprestige\u201d acts as Debbie Reynolds and the Lawrence Welk Orchestra, Thiele decided to issue the Crickets record on Brunswick, a smaller sister label known mostly for its jazz releases and therefore more suited to \u201cfaddish\u201d rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music. The irony was that both the Coral and Brunswick labels were subsidiaries of Decca Records, whom Buddy was trying to \u201chide\u201d from.

After \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day\u201d had been bought by Brunswick, but before it was issued, Buddy Holly recorded \u201cWords of Love,\u201d a song Bob Thiele felt should not be hidden away on a minor label such as Brunswick.

One of these rumors involved the provision of food stamps for Floridians whose homes had experienced power outages of at least two hours in duration. A typical expression of the rumor read as follows: #FLORIDA If your power was out for more than two hours. You are eligible for food stamps. $197.00 per person.

A separate but related rumor held that FEMA was directly providing Floridians with $500 for food purchases: For those in need FEMA is giving $500 direct deposit that can be used for food. Apply at\u00a0disasterassistance.gov FEMA 1-800-621-3362 or 1-800-462-7585 None of these rumors was quite right, and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as Disaster-SNAP (or D-SNAP), which was\u00a0extended to parts\u00a0of Florida on 22 September 2017. D-SNAP is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps) to individuals affected by natural disasters. One does not have to be an existing recipient of SNAP benefits in order to qualify for D-SNAP, but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits. D-SNAP assistance typically lasts for one month, but Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on 22 September that the program would be in place for two months in Florida. Recipients are provided with a temporary EBT card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income. A one-person household with a gross monthly income of $1,664 or less would receive $194 in D-SNAP credit for one month (a figure that may be the source of the \u201c$197 per person\u201d claim in some Facebook rumors). An eight-person household (provided it has a gross monthly income of $4,151 or less) would be eligible to receive $1,169 in D-SNAP assistance (an average of $146 per person). A two-person household (provided it met the income requirements) would be eligible for $357 in benefits, or $179.50 per person. (There is no set benefit amount per person, a common element of the rumors which is misleading.) The extension of D-SNAP in Florida applies to certain counties. A county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours, as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered. So power outages do play a role in the provision of extended SNAP benefits, but only on the county level. Such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must have experienced a power outage for \u201cmore than two hours,\u201d or that applicants must provide photographic evidence of such outages. The appropriate place to apply for Disaster-SNAP assistance in Florida is the\u00a0ACCESS Florida web page. Other assistance is available As well as Disaster-SNAP, existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Irma. According to the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, regular Florida recipients can (as of 12 September 2017) temporarily use EBT cards to buy hot food (something they cannot normally do) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in September: USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently approved a temporary waiver and supported other actions that will help households participating in the USDA\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Florida, Georgia, and the Virgin Islands, and the Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto Rico, to access food in the wake of Hurricane Irma, including: In addition to these modifications, several types of federally-provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, both in Florida and in other states. These benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs, as well as direct assistance such as FEMA\u2019s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi-family rental properties and performing repairs, with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals. Variations in eligibility, rates of payment, duration of assistance, and type of assistance mean that it\u2019s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive. Residents of states that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance, and apply for such assistance, by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov. The claim asserted in one of the Facebook rumors, that FEMA is offering individuals $500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food, has a grain of truth to it. As part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in state where major disasters have been declared (as was the case in Florida), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what\u2019s known as Critical Needs Assistance, which consists of a one-time payment of $500, as explained by FEMA: FEMA may provide financial assistance to individuals and households who, as a result of the disaster, have immediate or critical needs because they are displaced from their primary dwelling. Immediate or critical needs are life-saving and life-sustaining items including, but not limited to: water, food, first aid, prescriptions, infant formula, diapers, consumable medical supplies, durable medical equipment, personal hygiene items, and fuel for transportation \u2026 It is a one-time $500 payment per household. However, the state must first ask FEMA to authorize Critical Needs Assistance in specific counties particularly badly hit by a disaster, FEMA must then grant that authorization, and the individual must go through an application process. FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance in certain Florida counties, which are listed on the FEMA web site. The Critical Needs Assistance application is available only to individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced, and who had previously resided in counties where FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance.","sources":" ","label":2,"subjects":"Viral Phenomena, FEMA, florida, food stamps","__index_level_0__":6958,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn September 2017, Facebook users spread several rumors about government benefits and assistance available to Florida residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.

Apply at\u00a0disasterassistance.gov FEMA 1-800-621-3362 or 1-800-462-7585 None of these rumors was quite right, and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as Disaster-SNAP (or D-SNAP), which was\u00a0extended to parts\u00a0of Florida on 22 September 2017. D-SNAP is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps) to individuals affected by natural disasters. One does not have to be an existing recipient of SNAP benefits in order to qualify for D-SNAP, but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits. D-SNAP assistance typically lasts for one month, but Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on 22 September that the program would be in place for two months in Florida. Recipients are provided with a temporary EBT card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income. A one-person household with a gross monthly income of $1,664 or less would receive $194 in D-SNAP credit for one month (a figure that may be the source of the \u201c$197 per person\u201d claim in some Facebook rumors). An eight-person household (provided it has a gross monthly income of $4,151 or less) would be eligible to receive $1,169 in D-SNAP assistance (an average of $146 per person). A two-person household (provided it met the income requirements) would be eligible for $357 in benefits, or $179.50 per person. (There is no set benefit amount per person, a common element of the rumors which is misleading.) The extension of D-SNAP in Florida applies to certain counties. A county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours, as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered. So power outages do play a role in the provision of extended SNAP benefits, but only on the county level. Such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must have experienced a power outage for \u201cmore than two hours,\u201d or that applicants must provide photographic evidence of such outages. The appropriate place to apply for Disaster-SNAP assistance in Florida is the\u00a0ACCESS Florida web page. Other assistance is available As well as Disaster-SNAP, existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Irma. According to the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, regular Florida recipients can (as of 12 September 2017) temporarily use EBT cards to buy hot food (something they cannot normally do) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in September: USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently approved a temporary waiver and supported other actions that will help households participating in the USDA\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Florida, Georgia, and the Virgin Islands, and the Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto Rico, to access food in the wake of Hurricane Irma, including: In addition to these modifications, several types of federally-provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, both in Florida and in other states. These benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs, as well as direct assistance such as FEMA\u2019s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi-family rental properties and performing repairs, with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals. Variations in eligibility, rates of payment, duration of assistance, and type of assistance mean that it\u2019s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive. Residents of states that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance, and apply for such assistance, by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov. The claim asserted in one of the Facebook rumors, that FEMA is offering individuals $500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food, has a grain of truth to it. As part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in state where major disasters have been declared (as was the case in Florida), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what\u2019s known as Critical Needs Assistance, which consists of a one-time payment of $500, as explained by FEMA: FEMA may provide financial assistance to individuals and households who, as a result of the disaster, have immediate or critical needs because they are displaced from their primary dwelling. Immediate or critical needs are life-saving and life-sustaining items including, but not limited to: water, food, first aid, prescriptions, infant formula, diapers, consumable medical supplies, durable medical equipment, personal hygiene items, and fuel for transportation \u2026 It is a one-time $500 payment per household. However, the state must first ask FEMA to authorize Critical Needs Assistance in specific counties particularly badly hit by a disaster, FEMA must then grant that authorization, and the individual must go through an application process. FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance in certain Florida counties, which are listed on the FEMA web site. The Critical Needs Assistance application is available only to individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced, and who had previously resided in counties where FEMA has authorized Critical Needs Assistance.n\nClaim: Florida residents affected by Hurricane Irma can receive $197 in food stamp benefits, but only if they can show that their homes lost power for more than two hours.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that Florida residents affected by Hurricane Irma can receive $197 in food stamp benefits, but only if they can show that their homes lost power for more than two hours, is false. The actual program in question, Disaster-SNAP (D-SNAP), does not require individual households to demonstrate a power outage of a specific duration to qualify. Instead, eligibility for D-SNAP is based on a combination of factors including residence in a designated disaster area and income limits, and the amount provided varies based on household size and income, not a flat rate per person. Additionally, the eligibility for D-SNAP is determined at the county level, based on overall impact and outages, rather than on individual household circumstances such as a two-hour power outage."}

Gen. Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad, Iraq, speculation flew about impending war, eventually turning into rumors about an American military draft.On the day Suleimani was killed, news organizations\u00a0addressed\u00a0the possibility of war with Iran:A deadly opening attack. Nearly untraceable, ruthless proxies spreading chaos on multiple continents. Costly miscalculations. And thousands \u2014 perhaps hundreds of thousands \u2014 killed in a conflict that would dwarf the war in Iraq.Welcome to the US-Iran war, which has the potential to be one of the worst conflicts in history.Readers expressed anxiety and fear as they contemplated a new war, and several discussions turned to military recruiting and the possibility of a draft. Some people posted questions on Facebook about what a draft might look like in 2020:I saw a meme somewhere claiming that being on antidepressants disqualifies you from the US military draft but haven\u2019t found a definitive answer for whether that\u2019s true. I see posts saying that if you want to join the military and have depression, then you could be disqualified, but if you still want to and can be considered stable, then you have a fair shot. What about people who would be forced to join thru a draft tho?Concerns about the prospect of war with Iran and who might be conscripted for the potential conflict also emerged in meme form:As usual, discourse also took place\u00a0on Twitter, where speculation also involved ADHD medications like Adderall as possible draft disqualifiers:bruh how they gonna draft any of gen z if it's required to be off antidepressants for 2 years\u2014 Jadyn (@wetritzcracker) January 4, 2020me finding out they can\u2019t draft me bc i\u2019m on antidepressants #WWIII pic.twitter.com\/4gP2ZoyUJe\u2014 Tori (@torideprow) January 3, 2020Military also won\u2019t draft you if you are employed, have taken any antidepressants or drugs for mental health including adderall https:\/\/t.co\/cs3ZhrX3Yf\u2014 koplin (@kopi_wan) January 3, 2020All of these assertions were underpinned by uncertainty \u2014 both about whether a military draft could conceivably be in the cards, and whether something like having been prescribed Lexapro or Zoloft was sufficient to avoid being drafted or conscripted to fight a war.For context, the last time the United States drafted anyone into service was 1973, nearly half a century prior to 2020 speculation about war with Iran. However, ongoing discussion about how a 2020 draft might appear was disrupted by a series of hoax text messages received by many Americans several days after Soleimani\u2019s death.On January 7 2020, the official United States Army Recruiting account tweeted\u00a0out a fact check confirming that citizens had received text message notifications they\u2019d been contacted about a draft:Fact check: The @USArmy is NOT contacting anyone regarding the draft.Text messages currently circulating are false and are not official Army communications.Read more: https:\/\/t.co\/csGpTQNfQc\u2014 U.S. Army Recruiting (@usarec) January 7, 2020Twitter users in the comments asked whether a draft could occur, and @usarec responded\u00a0with information about the legislative structure of a draft:The U.S. Army does not control the draft. Per the @SSS_gov, the agency that oversees Selective Service system, in the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the President would need to pass official legislation to enact a draft.\u2014 U.S. Army Recruiting (@usarec) January 7, 2020U.S. Army Recruiting Command indicated in their fact check that they had received multiple queries about \u201cfake text messages\u201d announcing a draft, and clarified:U.S. Army Recruiting Command has received multiple calls and emails about these fake text messages and wants to ensure Americans understand these texts are false and were not initiated by this command or the U.S. Army.The decision to enact a draft is not made at or by U.S. Army Recruiting Command. The Selective Service System, a separate agency outside of the Department of Defense, is the organization that manages registration for the Selective Service.\u201cThe Selective Service System is conducting business as usual,\u201d according to the Selective Service System\u2019s official Facebook page. \u201cIn the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the President would need to pass official legislation to authorize a draft.\u201dThe draft has not been in effect since 1973. The military has been an all-volunteer force since that time. Registering for the Selective Service does not enlist a person into the military.Army recruiting operations are proceeding as normal.But as evidenced by the reply embedded above, worries about the draft nevertheless persisted. And an aspect of that lingering fear involved whether antidepressants (or therapeutic stimulants) disqualified people from being drafted.As indicated in the\u00a0U.S. Army Recruiting Command\u2019s Twitter replies and fact check, no one has been drafted in the United States since 1973. As such, any information about a potential future draft can only be based on existing information regarding volunteer recruitment.Privately-run resource Military.com hosted a FAQ about recruitment, and question number nine had to do with antidepressants and enlistment, not a draft. Answers were compiled from information submitted on forums \u201cmonitored and answered by real recruiters,\u201d and the scope of the question about whether \u201canti-depressants disqualifying\u201d was wide. Two answers were submitted, with a broad scope of application to putative draftees and recruits.According to that information, antidepressants disqualified potential recruits for a year after ceasing to take the medication. Moreover, the answering recruiter said self-initiated cessation was insufficient to enlist. A second question appeared to have been answered by an Air Force member:Response 1: Anti depressants are disqualifying for 1 year after you stop taking them. You MUST stop with your doctors advice, DO NOT stop on your own. These medications often have to be reduced slowly to lower side effects and reduce risk of relapse. Once you are off and depression free for 1 year get copies of your treatment paperwork, including therapy notes and take them with you to your recruiter. They will submit the documents to [United States Military Entrance Processing Command\/Station, or MEPS] for review. MEPS will either DQ you, allow you to physical and enlist, or allow you to physical with a waiver (most likely).Response 2: You\u2019ll need to bring my medical records from the doctor who prescribed the anti-depressants. You\u2019ll go to MEPS, take the [Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB] but your processing will be terminated at a certain point due to being honest about depression. Your records will be sent to the [Air Force] surgeon general\u2019s office for review. This supposedly takes between six weeks and three months \u2014 mine took a full three months. If the waiver is granted, you\u2019ll be cleared to return to MEPS. On your return trip, they\u2019ll do a height\/weight check then send you offsite to a psych consult. The doctor will then send his recommendation to MEPS where you will be reviewed further. This took nearly five weeks for me. If you are deemed fit for service, you will return to MEPS for job selection. Contrary to what I was initially told, depression rules out many jobs in the AF.It appears that the military and its branches had a fluid and changing policy on mental health conditions, medication, and medical history. In November 2017, USA Today reported on a previously undisclosed policy allowing people with a medical history of mental illness to obtain waivers and serve:People with a history of \u201cself-mutilation,\u201d bipolar disorder, depression and drug and alcohol abuse can now seek waivers to join the Army under an unannounced policy enacted in August [2017], according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.The decision to open Army recruiting to those with mental health conditions comes as the service faces the challenging goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018. To meet last year\u2019s goal of 69,000, the Army accepted more recruits who fared poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers granted for marijuana use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.U.S. Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Randy Taylor told the outlet that the new guidelines were not necessarily hard and fast ones:\u201cWith the additional data available, Army officials can now consider applicants as a whole person, allowing a series of Army leaders and medical professionals to review the case fully to assess the applicant\u2019s physical limitations or medical conditions and their possible impact upon the applicant\u2019s ability to complete training and finish an Army career \u2026 These waivers are not considered lightly.\u201dIn April 2018, ArmyTimes.com\u00a0reported that relaxation of prior policies around medical and mental health histories had caused controversy following the November 2017\u00a0USA Today\u00a0piece. Again, the specifics of the policy did not seem to be fully clear at that time, and Army higher-ups described the changes as something of a case-by-case basis adopted for children of servicemen and women with more comprehensive childhood records:The Army\u2019s personnel chief responded to the memo in November [2017] by clarifying that it was mistakenly distributed, but adding that the service was beginning to have more of an open mind about recruits\u2019 mental health history.\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that the conditions themselves have been unfairly characterized,\u201d Lt. Gen. Thomas Seamands, the Army G-1, said in a statement at the time. \u201cFor example, a child who received behavioral counseling at age 10 would be forever banned from military service were it not for the ability to make a waiver request.\u201d\u2026\u00a0And in fact, it has been a concern for many military families. A spate of military children have been kicked out of initial military training after their childhood medical records were added to their service member records, sometimes revealing that they had turned to therapy as young children.It was also, as noted, a focus on volunteer enlistment \u2014 not a policy enacted with a draft in mind:\u201cThe waivers are really indicating to me that our recruiters are doing exactly what we\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey said [in April 2018]. \u201cIf they see something in the record that is of concern or is a question of meeting a DoD standard, they ask for somebody to review it.\u201dIn January 2019, the\u00a0Psychological Health Center of Excellence (or PHCoE, formerly known as the Deployment Health Clinical Center) Clinician\u2019s Corner blog included an entry titled \u201cNavy Changes Policy on Psychotropic Medications and Aviation.\u201d It discussed whether a service member who was diagnosed with a mental health condition could maintain their military flight status during treatment, explaining:Can a service member who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and is being treated with psychotropic medication maintain their military flight status while in treatment? YES! The use of psychotropic medications was disqualifying for U. S. Naval Aviators (pilots, flight officers, air traffic controllers and aircrew members) before November 2018. After this date, the U.S. Navy Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide (ARWG)(link is external) was updated to allow Navy and Marine Corps personnel who are on a stable dose of FDA-approved psychotropic medications to maintain their flight status during treatment.According to the PHCoE blog, the first Navy waivers were granted in 2017 \u2014 around the time the first report disclosing the existence of waivers appeared:The first waiver for a class of psychotropic medication use in Army aircrews was granted in 2004 for a diagnosis of chronic pain. Currently, Army aviators on stable doses of selected medications for most mental health diagnoses are eligible to maintain flight status. Similarly, Air Force policy allows designated personnel to fly while on monotherapy with one of four approved medications for treatment of specified conditions after the prescribed waiting periods officially went into effect in 2013. The Air Force is currently conducting a 20-year study to follow airmen on antidepressants, where results from the first five years found that no antidepressant medication has been associated with any Air Force mishap since the protocol started in 2013.The first waivers granted in the Navy began in 2017, for diagnoses of major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Upon review of selected individuals, the Consult Advisory Board voted to allow aviators, in specified flying billets (e.g. dual-piloted, non-tactical aircraft), to be eligible for waiver consideration with continued therapy with FDA-approved psychotropic medication(s). Consideration for a waiver may be requested after a suitable period of observation in a non-flying status has elapsed, provided that the dose of the medication(s) is stable and the clinical condition is determined to be in stable remission. The duration of this period of observation in a non-flying status is dictated by the psychiatric diagnosis and is outlined in the relevant section of the ARWG.Operation Military Kids\u2019 \u201c20 Health Conditions That May Not Allow You to Join the Military\u201d page was updated on January 3 2020, and it contained a section on depression. According to that site, a history of depression (and presumably having taken antidepressants) might make it \u201cdifficult\u201d (but not impossible) to enlist:Since the U.S. Armed Forces deal with arming individuals with powerful weapons it must tread on mental health very carefully. Though people with mental health concerns are very good people that are still capable of living high-quality lives, the U.S. Military is very strict on how it handles mood disorders \u2026 [That] means that if you or someone you know that is considering enlisting in the U.S. Military has been diagnosed with [depression] in the past, it may be difficult to join.Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were labeled \u201cpossibly disqualifying,\u201d while bipolar disorder was described as \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder was also described as a disqualifying condition, with the following caveat:The military is currently reexamining its approach for ADHD and has noted recently that it might start assessing circumstances on a case by case basis.After conflict between the United States and Iran was initiated due to Suleimani\u2019s death, speculation about war led to rumors that using antidepressants disqualified Americans from any military draft. An unrelated hoax exploited simmering draft fears, leading military recruiters to reiterate that reinstatement of the draft was a legislatively complicated process. Given that nearly half a century had passed since the previous active draft, the only up-to-date information available had to do with voluntary enlistment.

Gen. Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad, Iraq, speculation flew about impending war, eventually turning into rumors about an American military draft.On the day Suleimani was killed, news organizations\u00a0addressed\u00a0the possibility of war with Iran:A deadly opening attack. Nearly untraceable, ruthless proxies spreading chaos on multiple continents. Costly miscalculations. And thousands \u2014 perhaps hundreds of thousands \u2014 killed in a conflict that would dwarf the war in Iraq.Welcome to the US-Iran war, which has the potential to be one of the worst conflicts in history.Readers expressed anxiety and fear as they contemplated a new war, and several discussions turned to military recruiting and the possibility of a draft. Some people posted questions on Facebook about what a draft might look like in 2020:I saw a meme somewhere claiming that being on antidepressants disqualifies you from the US military draft but haven\u2019t found a definitive answer for whether that\u2019s true. I see posts saying that if you want to join the military and have depression, then you could be disqualified, but if you still want to and can be considered stable, then you have a fair shot. What about people who would be forced to join thru a draft tho?Concerns about the prospect of war with Iran and who might be conscripted for the potential conflict also emerged in meme form:As usual, discourse also took place\u00a0on Twitter, where speculation also involved ADHD medications like Adderall as possible draft disqualifiers:bruh how they gonna draft any of gen z if it's required to be off antidepressants for 2 years\u2014 Jadyn (@wetritzcracker) January 4, 2020me finding out they can\u2019t draft me bc i\u2019m on antidepressants #WWIII pic.twitter.com\/4gP2ZoyUJe\u2014 Tori (@torideprow) January 3, 2020Military also won\u2019t draft you if you are employed, have taken any antidepressants or drugs for mental health including adderall https:\/\/t.co\/cs3ZhrX3Yf\u2014 koplin (@kopi_wan) January 3, 2020All of these assertions were underpinned by uncertainty \u2014 both about whether a military draft could conceivably be in the cards, and whether something like having been prescribed Lexapro or Zoloft was sufficient to avoid being drafted or conscripted to fight a war.For context, the last time the United States drafted anyone into service was 1973, nearly half a century prior to 2020 speculation about war with Iran. However, ongoing discussion about how a 2020 draft might appear was disrupted by a series of hoax text messages received by many Americans several days after Soleimani\u2019s death.On January 7 2020, the official United States Army Recruiting account tweeted\u00a0out a fact check confirming that citizens had received text message notifications they\u2019d been contacted about a draft:Fact check: The @USArmy is NOT contacting anyone regarding the draft.Text messages currently circulating are false and are not official Army communications.Read more: https:\/\/t.co\/csGpTQNfQc\u2014 U.S. Army Recruiting (@usarec) January 7, 2020Twitter users in the comments asked whether a draft could occur, and @usarec responded\u00a0with information about the legislative structure of a draft:The U.S. Army does not control the draft. Per the @SSS_gov, the agency that oversees Selective Service system, in the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the President would need to pass official legislation to enact a draft.\u2014 U.S. Army Recruiting (@usarec) January 7, 2020U.S. Army Recruiting Command indicated in their fact check that they had received multiple queries about \u201cfake text messages\u201d announcing a draft, and clarified:U.S. Army Recruiting Command has received multiple calls and emails about these fake text messages and wants to ensure Americans understand these texts are false and were not initiated by this command or the U.S. Army.The decision to enact a draft is not made at or by U.S. Army Recruiting Command. The Selective Service System, a separate agency outside of the Department of Defense, is the organization that manages registration for the Selective Service.\u201cThe Selective Service System is conducting business as usual,\u201d according to the Selective Service System\u2019s official Facebook page. \u201cIn the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the President would need to pass official legislation to authorize a draft.\u201dThe draft has not been in effect since 1973. The military has been an all-volunteer force since that time. Registering for the Selective Service does not enlist a person into the military.Army recruiting operations are proceeding as normal.But as evidenced by the reply embedded above, worries about the draft nevertheless persisted. And an aspect of that lingering fear involved whether antidepressants (or therapeutic stimulants) disqualified people from being drafted.As indicated in the\u00a0U.S. Army Recruiting Command\u2019s Twitter replies and fact check, no one has been drafted in the United States since 1973. As such, any information about a potential future draft can only be based on existing information regarding volunteer recruitment.Privately-run resource Military.com hosted a FAQ about recruitment, and question number nine had to do with antidepressants and enlistment, not a draft. Answers were compiled from information submitted on forums \u201cmonitored and answered by real recruiters,\u201d and the scope of the question about whether \u201canti-depressants disqualifying\u201d was wide. Two answers were submitted, with a broad scope of application to putative draftees and recruits.According to that information, antidepressants disqualified potential recruits for a year after ceasing to take the medication. Moreover, the answering recruiter said self-initiated cessation was insufficient to enlist. A second question appeared to have been answered by an Air Force member:Response 1: Anti depressants are disqualifying for 1 year after you stop taking them. You MUST stop with your doctors advice, DO NOT stop on your own. These medications often have to be reduced slowly to lower side effects and reduce risk of relapse. Once you are off and depression free for 1 year get copies of your treatment paperwork, including therapy notes and take them with you to your recruiter. They will submit the documents to [United States Military Entrance Processing Command\/Station, or MEPS] for review. MEPS will either DQ you, allow you to physical and enlist, or allow you to physical with a waiver (most likely).Response 2: You\u2019ll need to bring my medical records from the doctor who prescribed the anti-depressants. You\u2019ll go to MEPS, take the [Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB] but your processing will be terminated at a certain point due to being honest about depression. Your records will be sent to the [Air Force] surgeon general\u2019s office for review. This supposedly takes between six weeks and three months \u2014 mine took a full three months. If the waiver is granted, you\u2019ll be cleared to return to MEPS. On your return trip, they\u2019ll do a height\/weight check then send you offsite to a psych consult. The doctor will then send his recommendation to MEPS where you will be reviewed further. This took nearly five weeks for me. If you are deemed fit for service, you will return to MEPS for job selection. Contrary to what I was initially told, depression rules out many jobs in the AF.It appears that the military and its branches had a fluid and changing policy on mental health conditions, medication, and medical history. In November 2017, USA Today reported on a previously undisclosed policy allowing people with a medical history of mental illness to obtain waivers and serve:People with a history of \u201cself-mutilation,\u201d bipolar disorder, depression and drug and alcohol abuse can now seek waivers to join the Army under an unannounced policy enacted in August [2017], according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.The decision to open Army recruiting to those with mental health conditions comes as the service faces the challenging goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018. To meet last year\u2019s goal of 69,000, the Army accepted more recruits who fared poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers granted for marijuana use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.U.S. Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Randy Taylor told the outlet that the new guidelines were not necessarily hard and fast ones:\u201cWith the additional data available, Army officials can now consider applicants as a whole person, allowing a series of Army leaders and medical professionals to review the case fully to assess the applicant\u2019s physical limitations or medical conditions and their possible impact upon the applicant\u2019s ability to complete training and finish an Army career \u2026 These waivers are not considered lightly.\u201dIn April 2018, ArmyTimes.com\u00a0reported that relaxation of prior policies around medical and mental health histories had caused controversy following the November 2017\u00a0USA Today\u00a0piece. Again, the specifics of the policy did not seem to be fully clear at that time, and Army higher-ups described the changes as something of a case-by-case basis adopted for children of servicemen and women with more comprehensive childhood records:The Army\u2019s personnel chief responded to the memo in November [2017] by clarifying that it was mistakenly distributed, but adding that the service was beginning to have more of an open mind about recruits\u2019 mental health history.\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that the conditions themselves have been unfairly characterized,\u201d Lt. Gen. Thomas Seamands, the Army G-1, said in a statement at the time. \u201cFor example, a child who received behavioral counseling at age 10 would be forever banned from military service were it not for the ability to make a waiver request.\u201d\u2026\u00a0And in fact, it has been a concern for many military families. A spate of military children have been kicked out of initial military training after their childhood medical records were added to their service member records, sometimes revealing that they had turned to therapy as young children.It was also, as noted, a focus on volunteer enlistment \u2014 not a policy enacted with a draft in mind:\u201cThe waivers are really indicating to me that our recruiters are doing exactly what we\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey said [in April 2018]. \u201cIf they see something in the record that is of concern or is a question of meeting a DoD standard, they ask for somebody to review it.\u201dIn January 2019, the\u00a0Psychological Health Center of Excellence (or PHCoE, formerly known as the Deployment Health Clinical Center) Clinician\u2019s Corner blog included an entry titled \u201cNavy Changes Policy on Psychotropic Medications and Aviation.\u201d It discussed whether a service member who was diagnosed with a mental health condition could maintain their military flight status during treatment, explaining:Can a service member who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and is being treated with psychotropic medication maintain their military flight status while in treatment? YES! The use of psychotropic medications was disqualifying for U. S. Naval Aviators (pilots, flight officers, air traffic controllers and aircrew members) before November 2018. After this date, the U.S. Navy Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide (ARWG)(link is external) was updated to allow Navy and Marine Corps personnel who are on a stable dose of FDA-approved psychotropic medications to maintain their flight status during treatment.According to the PHCoE blog, the first Navy waivers were granted in 2017 \u2014 around the time the first report disclosing the existence of waivers appeared:The first waiver for a class of psychotropic medication use in Army aircrews was granted in 2004 for a diagnosis of chronic pain. Currently, Army aviators on stable doses of selected medications for most mental health diagnoses are eligible to maintain flight status. Similarly, Air Force policy allows designated personnel to fly while on monotherapy with one of four approved medications for treatment of specified conditions after the prescribed waiting periods officially went into effect in 2013. The Air Force is currently conducting a 20-year study to follow airmen on antidepressants, where results from the first five years found that no antidepressant medication has been associated with any Air Force mishap since the protocol started in 2013.The first waivers granted in the Navy began in 2017, for diagnoses of major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Upon review of selected individuals, the Consult Advisory Board voted to allow aviators, in specified flying billets (e.g. dual-piloted, non-tactical aircraft), to be eligible for waiver consideration with continued therapy with FDA-approved psychotropic medication(s). Consideration for a waiver may be requested after a suitable period of observation in a non-flying status has elapsed, provided that the dose of the medication(s) is stable and the clinical condition is determined to be in stable remission. The duration of this period of observation in a non-flying status is dictated by the psychiatric diagnosis and is outlined in the relevant section of the ARWG.Operation Military Kids\u2019 \u201c20 Health Conditions That May Not Allow You to Join the Military\u201d page was updated on January 3 2020, and it contained a section on depression. According to that site, a history of depression (and presumably having taken antidepressants) might make it \u201cdifficult\u201d (but not impossible) to enlist:Since the U.S. Armed Forces deal with arming individuals with powerful weapons it must tread on mental health very carefully. Though people with mental health concerns are very good people that are still capable of living high-quality lives, the U.S. Military is very strict on how it handles mood disorders \u2026 [That] means that if you or someone you know that is considering enlisting in the U.S. Military has been diagnosed with [depression] in the past, it may be difficult to join.Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were labeled \u201cpossibly disqualifying,\u201d while bipolar disorder was described as \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder was also described as a disqualifying condition, with the following caveat:The military is currently reexamining its approach for ADHD and has noted recently that it might start assessing circumstances on a case by case basis.After conflict between the United States and Iran was initiated due to Suleimani\u2019s death, speculation about war led to rumors that using antidepressants disqualified Americans from any military draft. An unrelated hoax exploited simmering draft fears, leading military recruiters to reiterate that reinstatement of the draft was a legislatively complicated process. Given that nearly half a century had passed since the previous active draft, the only up-to-date information available had to do with voluntary enlistment. As of 2017, the United States military had relaxed their policies about mental health and antidepressants to some degree, but those policies appeared to be in ongoing flux. Further, it was incredibly difficult to extrapolate how such fluid guidelines might apply to an involuntary enlistment process or draft. Because of this, we have rated this claim Decontextualized due to the complexity of its elements.n\nClaim: Any history of antidepressant use disqualifies a person from the military and\/or the draft.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence shows that the policies regarding antidepressant use and military enlistment have been fluid and have undergone changes over the years. While antidepressants can disqualify individuals from enlisting in the military for a period (typically a year after cessation of use, as per the information provided), there are instances where waivers can be obtained, and the policy has been relaxed to some extent since 2017. The policies are not absolute and can depend on the individual's condition and the evaluation of medical authorities within the military. Moreover, the claim specifically addressing the draft is harder to verify since the U.S. has not had a draft since 1973, and any current information only pertains to voluntary enlistment. Therefore, the statement that any history of antidepressant use unequivocally disqualifies a person from the military or a potential draft is neither entirely true nor entirely false."}
{"claim_id":9362,"hypothesis":"16:8 FASTING DIET LINKED TO WEIGHT LOSS AND HEALTH BENEFITS IN STUDY","date_published":"June 21, 2018","explanation_1":"This story described a small study of whether a regime that restricts eating to an eight-hour daily window help people reduce their risk factors for developing metabolic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.

However, it didn\u2019t give enough information to help readers understand whether weight loss and blood pressure improvements were sufficient to reduce disease risk. The headline also oversells the findings by stating that the fasting plan is \u201clinked to weight loss and health benefits.\u201d In fact, the study found most metabolic risk factors unchanged. The story also would have been stronger had it used people-first language to help reduce stigma around obesity. There\u2019s a lot of excitement around Intermittent fasting as a strategy to lose weight and reduce risk factors for metabolic diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The so-called 16:8 fasting diet is just the latest flavor. Early-phase studies like this one provide just a clue of how well they work.

{"claim_id":9083,"hypothesis":"Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit","date_published":"October 6, 2017","explanation_1":"Editor\u2019s note: On the day this\u00a0 review was published, the news release it\u2019s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke. Figuring out ways to persuade them to stop has merit.","fact_checkers":"Sharon Dunwoody, PhD,Karen Carlson, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"It is not made clear what costs would accompany this kind of mobile health message strategy, and whether the costs would be absorbed by health plans and health care providers that use the service, or by individual patients.

Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster.\"\" The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript:  Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) \"\"Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.\"\" Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) \"\"Wives submit yourself to your own husband.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us.\"\" Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL. Webster: \"\"You should submit to me.

Hands off our bodies. And our laws.\"\" The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that \"\"Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands\"\" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: \"\"SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990).\"\" So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, \"\"creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.\"\" Florida law currently allows married couples to\u00a0divorce if a court finds that the marriage is \"\"irretrievably broken.\"\" It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary \"\"covenant marriage.\"\" Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:  \"\"I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.\"\" The covenant marriage agreement \"\"may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery,\"\" according to the bill Webster filed. \"\"A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted,\"\" HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that \"\"no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife,\"\" but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the \"\"original\"\" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was \"\"significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,\"\" Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad \"\"Taliban Dan Webster,\"\" Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce. Because all of that context is critical to understanding Grayson's claim,\"","sources":"http:\/\/www.healthymarriageinfo.org\/, https:\/\/docs.google.com\/fileview?id=1xNiW4XFXps_0ooYZxOlOrUsYq462A0sPeZbEfUYsVLwKsflhzEOGLlyE36E9&hl=en&authkey=CLaCxCU, http:\/\/www.supreme.state.az.us\/dr\/pdf\/covenant.pdf, http:\/\/labep.ucs.inrs.ca\/laplanteb\/DMO6500\/New%20Louisiana%20Covenant%20Marriage%20Law.htm, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dvB-mHXcWzg, https:\/\/www.flsenate.gov\/STATUTES\/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099\/0061\/0061.html, http:\/\/www.nwamarriages.com\/about\/pdf\/cov_marriage_app.pdf","label":3,"subjects":"Marriage, Message Machine 2010, Religion, Women, Florida, Alan Grayson, ","__index_level_0__":4741,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"U.S. Rep.

In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was \"\"significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,\"\" Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad \"\"Taliban Dan Webster,\"\" Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce. Because all of that context is critical to understanding Grayson's claim,\"n\nClaim: Alan Grayson Says Daniel Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim made by Alan Grayson that Daniel Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives, is partially true and false. The evidence shows that Webster proposed a bill for a voluntary form of 'covenant marriage' that could only be dissolved in cases of adultery, not listing physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. This does not make divorce illegal for all; it specifically applies to those who opt into a covenant marriage, which would limit the ability to divorce except in cases of adultery. However, Grayson's claim exaggerates the scope of Webster's bill by implying it would apply universally to all marriages and completely eliminate the possibility of divorce for abused wives, which is not accurate. The bill was voluntary and only affected those who chose covenant marriage, not all marriages."}

And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state\u2019s website.

That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio \/ file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It\u2019s a big sum, especially this early in the election year.

It\u2019s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year\u2019s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what\u2019s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what\u2019s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle.

When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. \"\"The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate,\"\" he said. \"\"When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings \u2026 you realize far more money has been raised.\"\" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year\u2019s ballot.

Chuck Schumer said would be \u201ctaking money away from kids who need health care.\u201d But congressional budget experts say most of that money cannot be legally spent and the number of individuals covered would not be affected.The main point of contention is the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to take $2 billion from a contingency fund used if states face a shortfall and higher-than-expected enrollment in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. CHIP, which is jointly funded by the federal government and the states, is for children and pregnant women in families with low incomes, but not low enough to qualify for Medicaid.Since fiscal 2009, when the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established, three states \u2014 Iowa, Michigan and Tennessee \u2014 have received payments from it, according to a 2018 report from the Congressional Research Service. The three states spent a total of $108.6 million in contingency funding.\u201cStates have not had to access the contingency funds that much over time,\u201d\u00a0Robin Rudowitz, associate director for the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured, told us. But, then again, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what exactly might happen.\u201d The fund was set up as a safeguard, she said.Several Democrats have criticized the White House proposal, and even Republican Sen. Susan Collins questioned why there would be a \u201ccut\u201d to CHIP. Schumer, the\u00a0Senate minority leader,\u00a0said in a statement that \u201cmillions of children rely on\u201d this money \u201cduring outbreaks of the flu and other deadly illnesses.\u201dSchumer, May 7: It appears that sabotaging our health care system to the detriment of middle-class families wasn\u2019t enough for President Trump and Republicans; now they\u2019re going after health care dollars that millions of children rely on, especially during outbreaks of the flu and other deadly illnesses. Let\u2019s be honest about what this is: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), hurting middle-class families and low-income children, to appease the most conservative special interests and feel better about blowing up the deficit to give the wealthiest few and biggest corporations huge tax breaks.It\u2019s possible an outbreak of disease could cause states to need more money for CHIP, though they\u2019d have to have higher enrollment and a shortfall in funds to qualify for a payment from the contingency fund. States \u201chave to meet both of those conditions,\u201d Rudowitz said.At a May 8 press conference, Schumer characterized the Trump proposal as \u201ctaking money away from kids who need health care.\u201dRescissions of unspent CHIP funds have occurred before, including from the contingency fund, as recently as this year, when Congress passed an omnibus spending bill.All told, the administration has proposed $15 billion for rescission \u2014 or pulling back of funding that had been authorized but not yet spent. Most of the funding isn\u2019t expected to be used, in fact. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote\u00a0in a blog post that \u201cmost of these rescissions,\u201d including the ones to CHIP, \u201cwould cut budget authority for money that will not otherwise be spent,\u00a0resulting in no direct effect on the deficit.\u201dCRFB points out that the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget estimates that the $15 billion package would only reduce federal outlays (or spending), and therefore the deficit, by $3 billion. The plan requires congressional approval.Overall, since fiscal 2009, federal appropriations for CHIP have been more than enough to cover CHIP spending. Rudowitz explained that the program operates like a \u201cblock grant,\u201d so the yearly appropriations don\u2019t always equal the outlays.Through several appropriation bills, Congress has rescinded $42.8 billion from CHIP from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2017, the Congressional Research Service report said. Most of the rescissions from CHIP came from a performance bonus payment fund for states that increased Medicaid enrollment of children. And $11.1 billion came from \u201cunobligated national allotments,\u201d or federal funds not allocated to states. The CRS report said that $1.7 billion was rescinded from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund in fiscal 2016 \u2014\u00a0marking the first time rescissions were made to the emergency fund.The largest part of the Trump administration\u2019s rescission request from CHIP is $5.1 billion from funds for fiscal 2017 \u201cthat can no longer be spent,\u201d CRFB said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office explained\u00a0in a May 8 letter that those funds can no longer be distributed to states, because the authority to do so expired in 2017. So, the main issue \u2014 and the focus of Schumer\u2019s criticism \u2014 is the $1.9 billion from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund. CBO wrote that \u201cbased on information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CBO projects that the rescission from the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund would not affect payments to states over the 2018-2028 period.\u201dIt said that rescinding the $7 billion in CHIP money \u201cwould not affect outlays, or the number of individuals with insurance coverage.\u201dThe budget watchdog group CRFB said the contingency money \u201clikely will not be used.\u201d\u00a0As we said, since the contingency fund was established in 2009, three states have received payments from it when they faced both a shortfall and higher-than-expected enrollment of children, according to CRS. (Total federal appropriations for CHIP were still more than enough to cover all states\u2019 spending as a whole. )Michigan got a $52.6 million payment from the fund in fiscal 2015, according to a 2016 fact sheet from the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Angela Minicuci told us that the state had higher-than-expected enrollment, and a subsequent funding shortfall, due to federal poverty level changes in the Affordable Care Act.Tennessee received $226.7 million in September 2016 but only spent $27.1 million a few months later. It needed the money for \u201cretroactive CHIP expenditures as a result of changes to the CHIP eligibility standards dating back to January 1, 2014,\u201d according to Sarah Tanksley, director of communications, Division of TennCare. She said the state can no longer access the remainder of the unspent contingency payment.Iowa received $28.9 million in fiscal 2011, according to another MACPAC report. Matt Highland, public information officer at the state\u2019s Department of Human Services, told us the money covered shortfalls in fiscal 2011 and 2012.CRFB noted that a rescission from the contingency fund was made in the bipartisan omnibus spending bill passed in March.The omnibus rescinded nearly $2 billion from the fund. It passed the Senate by a 65-32 vote, with many Democrats voting yes. \u201cIn other words, most who are attacking this policy now for \u2018cutting\u2019 CHIP supported nearly the same policy just a few months ago,\u201d\u00a0Patrick Newton, press secretary at CRFB, told us in an email.Schumer was asked in a May 8 press conference why he supported the omnibus but objects to a similar rescission now. He said the difference was that the omnibus money was used for \u201cgood things.\u201d But now Trump is \u201cnot putting the money into good things; he\u2019s just cutting.\u201d Schumer went on to say: \u201cThey\u2019re just taking money away from kids who need health care.\u201dWe asked his office how the senator could say the rescission was \u201ctaking money away from kids\u201d when the money hadn\u2019t been allocated and isn\u2019t expected to be spent at all. Schumer\u2019s office responded in an email: \u201cIt has been used in the past though. It\u2019s there in case of emergency.\u201dHis office maintains the contingency money might be needed and should be preserved. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be gambling with those programs and children\u2019s health care in order to pay down a fraction of a percent of the deficit that Republicans created with their massive tax breaks to the wealthy,\u201d Schumer\u2019s office said.One additional issue is that the new request comes on top of that omnibus rescission, leaving about $500 million in the contingency fund for fiscal 2018, which ends in less than five months on Sept. 30.Schumer\u2019s office referred us to comments by\u00a0Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, who\u00a0told the Washington Post that this \u201csets a very dangerous precedent\u201d for CHIP. Alker wrote on the center\u2019s website that \u201crescinding $2 billion from the fund undermines the very assurance it was created to provide.\u201dThe contingency fund should get a fresh influx of money in fiscal 2019, which starts Oct. 1, if current practices are followed. Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown\u2019s Center for Children and Families, told us that up to 20 percent of the national allotment for CHIP is allocated to the fund each budget year. That would mean up to about $4.5 billion should go into the contingency fund next fiscal year.Federal funding for the states for CHIP will total\u00a0$22.6 billion for 2019. States recently faced a gap in federal CHIP funding of several months while Congress debated extending the program. In measures passed in late January and early February, Congress extended CHIP funding through fiscal 2027.Update, May 11: We updated this story to include information on contingency fund payments to Tennessee and Iowa.","sources":"https:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/widgets\/share\/tool?canonicalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2018%2F05%2Fschumers-chip-spin%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtumblr%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug, https:\/\/www.senate.gov\/legislative\/LIS\/roll_call_lists\/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=2&vote=00063, https:\/\/www.macpac.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/CHIP-Factsheet-December-2016.pdf, https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/POTUS-Rescission-Transmittal-Package-5.8.2018.pdf, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2018%2F05%2Fschumers-chip-spin%2F%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug&t=Schumer%27s%20CHIP%20Spin, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/economy\/trump-calls-on-congress-to-pull-back-15-billion-in-spending-including-on-childrens-health-insurance-program\/2018\/05\/07\/9427de18-5216-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html?utm_term=.0aca481414eb, https:\/\/twitter.com\/SenStabenow\/status\/993635692331851776, https:\/\/www.macpac.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/March-2012-MACStats.pdf, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Schumer%27s%20CHIP%20Spin&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2018%2F05%2Fschumers-chip-spin%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial-pug&via=factcheckdotorg, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2018\/05\/08\/are-republicans-really-proposing-to-cut-funding-for-poor-kids-health-insurance\/?utm_term=.dbc12be56702, https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?c4728882\/schumer-chip, https:\/\/www.governor.pa.gov\/wolf-casey-oppose-white-house-chip-health-care-cuts\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/RonWyden\/status\/993616397761642500, https:\/\/fas.org\/sgp\/crs\/misc\/R43949.pdf, https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/system\/files\/115th-congress-2017-2018\/costestimate\/proposedrescissionsforchip.pdf, http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/floor-action\/senate\/386828-senate-gop-warms-to-trumps-rescissions-package, https:\/\/ccf.georgetown.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Healthy-Kids-Access-Acts-FINAL-1.pdf, https:\/\/ccf.georgetown.edu\/2018\/05\/08\/7-billion-in-chip-cuts\/, https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/115th-congress\/house-bill\/1625\/text, http:\/\/www.crfb.org\/blogs\/whats-presidents-rescission-request, https:\/\/ccf.georgetown.edu\/author\/joan-alker\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/RepTedDeutch\/status\/993660093722976259","label":3,"subjects":" children's health insurance, government spending, ","__index_level_0__":1155,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nThe White House has proposed rescinding $7 billion in unspent funds from a children\u2019s health program, a move Sen.

{"claim_id":10278,"hypothesis":"Yoga May Help Low Back Pain. Mental Effects? Not So Much","date_published":"October 25, 2011","explanation_1":"It is an interesting point to explore, since the study authors mentioned it as well. But the journalist could have dug a little deeper and noticed the study was never designed to prove this point\u2014and didn\u2019t. So the Wall St. Journal led with a mischaracterization of the study results. The study found that yoga and intensive stretching exercises were equally effective in relieving pain and enhancing function\u2014and that both were superior to a self-care educational booklet in the management of chronic back pain at the primary study endpoint of 12 weeks. \u201cFinding similar effects for both approaches suggests that yoga\u2019s benefits were largely attributable to the physical benefits of stretching and not to its mental component,\u201d the authors wrote in the discussion section. But this is just an opinion. And it is just as possible that both group interventions\u2014yoga and intensive stretching\u2014had physical and mental benefits in the management of low back pain. A recent article in the Lancet pointed out that the causes of low back pain are generally obscure, as are the mechanisms of pain relief. (See Balagu\u00e9 et al., 2011) The Wall St. Journal article offered a brief but useful description of the study, its background, and context. But as with a New York Times article on the same topic, there was a hole in the coverage. The journalist included the views of the study authors but offered no perspectives from independent experts. The study had an important limitation that should have at least been mentioned. The researchers studied relatively affluent subjects with mild, uncomplicated back pain that did not result in substantial functional problems. So the results may not apply to the individuals who bear the heaviest burden from chronic back pain and related disability: those on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, those with medicolegal dilemmas in the workplace, and those with other more complicated mental and physical health problems. The study also did not compare yoga to the \u201cusual treatments\u201d for low back pain offered in the U.S. medical system. So yoga\u2019s overall benefits may not be quite as clear as the Wall St. Journal article suggests. Chronic back pain is a huge social, economic, and medical problem. In the United States, back pain is the ninth most expensive medical condition for women, and the 10th for men, in terms of direct medical costs\u2014with chronic back pain accounting for a disproportionate chunk of those expenses. And the costs of work absence and disability claims related to back pain vastly exceed the medical price tag. Though Americans spend almost $35 billion per year on the medical treatment of back pain, the prevalence of chronic back pain appears to be rising\u2014and self-rated spinal health among Americans appears be declining. (See Soni, 2011; Freburger et al., 2009; and Martin et al., 2008). A number of nonsurgical treatments\u2014analgesics, exercise, manual therapies, complementary\/alternative therapies, psychological interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation\u2014are modestly effective in the management of chronic back pain. Yet for various reasons, Americans overuse ineffective treatments and underuse effective ones. (See Carey et al., 2009). So the identification of treatments that facilitate recovery and are popular with patients is a key social and medical priority.

For a short article, the Wall St. Journal story framed and quantified the benefits adequately. The article didn\u2019t discuss adverse events related to yoga or intensive stretching. Yet the authors of the study reported on both. These are important issues, as many patients with chronic back pain fear that becoming physically active will exacerbate their symptoms. We have two reasons to judge this unsatisfactory. There was no obvious disease-mongering in the article. Chronic back pain is a common, vexing problem. The story could have benefitted substantially from independent commentary by a researcher or healthcare provider not associated with the study. There were no stated conflicts-of-interest in the study. So none needed to be identified in the article. The clinical trial trial itself involved multiple alternatives: yoga, aerobic exercise and stretching, and a self-care educational intervention involving activity and lifetyle modification. So that probably fulfills this criterion. The journalist probably assumed that yoga and stretching programs are widely available in the U.S.\u2014which is a reasonable assumption. So the article wins a \u201csatisfatory\u201d on this point. But in fact, it is not all that clear that similarly standardized \u201cviniyoga\u201d classes designed to accommodate back pain patients are widely available\u2014or whether most health insurance plans will cover them. Intensive stretching classes would appear to be uncommon. So physical therapists or exercise physiologists might have to create them based on the study model. The journalist probably assumed that neither yoga nor stretching programs are novel so didn\u2019t address these issues in detail. And that is a reasonable assumption.

For a short article, the Wall St. Journal story framed and quantified the benefits adequately. The article didn\u2019t discuss adverse events related to yoga or intensive stretching. Yet the authors of the study reported on both. These are important issues, as many patients with chronic back pain fear that becoming physically active will exacerbate their symptoms. We have two reasons to judge this unsatisfactory. There was no obvious disease-mongering in the article. Chronic back pain is a common, vexing problem. The story could have benefitted substantially from independent commentary by a researcher or healthcare provider not associated with the study. There were no stated conflicts-of-interest in the study. So none needed to be identified in the article. The clinical trial trial itself involved multiple alternatives: yoga, aerobic exercise and stretching, and a self-care educational intervention involving activity and lifetyle modification. So that probably fulfills this criterion. The journalist probably assumed that yoga and stretching programs are widely available in the U.S.\u2014which is a reasonable assumption. So the article wins a \u201csatisfatory\u201d on this point. But in fact, it is not all that clear that similarly standardized \u201cviniyoga\u201d classes designed to accommodate back pain patients are widely available\u2014or whether most health insurance plans will cover them. Intensive stretching classes would appear to be uncommon. So physical therapists or exercise physiologists might have to create them based on the study model. The journalist probably assumed that neither yoga nor stretching programs are novel so didn\u2019t address these issues in detail. And that is a reasonable assumption.

Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family. The Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"\"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\" \"\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. \"\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\" A reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. \"\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\"\" he wrote. \"\" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. \u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019 This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of \"\"Ben Carson\"\" and \"\"Pell Grants\"\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college. \"\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\"\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"\"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson\u2019s \"\"family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,\"\" but didn\u2019t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson\u2019s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson\u2019s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson\u2019s past and his plans if elected president.

The Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"\"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\" \"\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. \"\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\" A reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line. \u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019 This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. \"\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\"\" Carson wrote. \u2018Got public housing\u2019 The details here are a little thin. When Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"\"modest house\"\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"\"move into the Boston tenements\"\" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"\"armies of roaches,\"\" \"\"hordes of rats\"\" and omnipresent \"\"winos and drunks.\"\" When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"\"upper lower-class neighborhood,\"\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"\"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\"\" and \"\"the ghetto.\"\" Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood. Got \u2018food stamps\u2019 This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. \"\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\"\" he wrote. \"\"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\" \u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019 This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. \"\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\"\" he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"\"actively recruited black students\"\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"\"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\" \"\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\"\" he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. \"\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\"\" he wrote. \"\" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\" Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. \u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019 This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of \"\"Ben Carson\"\" and \"\"Pell Grants\"\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college. \"\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\"\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"\"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\" The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"\"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\"\" and \"\"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\" We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. \"\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \"\" he said, according to a Politico account. \"\"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\" This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. \"\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\"\" he said. \"\"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\" Carson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"\"Eliminate dependency on government,\"\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson\u2019s \"\"family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,\"\" but didn\u2019t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson\u2019s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson\u2019s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson\u2019s past and his plans if elected president. Carson has said he wants to eliminate government dependency, but he also has made clear he intends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them. Carson hasn\u2019t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated. Overall, the meme is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.\"n\nClaim: Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that Ben Carson is running for president to 'eliminate dependency on government' aligns with his expressed intention to reduce government dependency, as evidenced by his public statements and campaign messaging. However, the meme's assertion that he does not mention his own use of public assistance programs such as public schools, public housing, food stamps, free glasses, and affirmative action is not completely accurate. Carson has openly discussed his upbringing and the benefits he received in his autobiography and other public statements. Nevertheless, there is not enough information to confirm if he received Pell Grants specifically, as this claim remains unsubstantiated in his public disclosures. Thus, while the meme correctly highlights some aspects of Carson's biography and political stance, it also oversimplifies and misrepresents some details, making the overall claim partially true and false."}

Perhaps what is most missing from this \u201cjust-the-facts ma\u2019am\u201d article on the USPSTF\u2019s recommendations is the larger sense of context: major statin trials have all been funded by statin manufacturers where we know that adverse event information is incomplete and sometimes hidden, benefits are typically exaggerated as they are expressed in relative risk reductions, and that most people, physicians and patients included, will likely overestimate the benefit they might derive from statin therapy. Above all, the medicalizing of cholesterol levels in otherwise healthy people is considered by some to be\u00a0among the biggest current scandals in medicine. Having said that, it was good to see this article tipping\u00a0the hat toward those who have put forward very strong arguments against the measuring and altering of our blood cholesterols, mentioning the questionable chance of benefit and the many potential harms.

In many cases, normal wear and tear means N95 respirators cannot be sanitized and reused without putting health workers at risk.","fact_checkers":"Shefali Luthra","premise":"\"As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, front-line health care workers are decrying unsafe working conditions \u2014 in particular, describing inadequate access to personal protective equipment, or PPE. Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available. But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. \"\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource.

N95Decon, a research collaborative with which El-Samad works, has examined Battelle\u2019s hydrogen peroxide approach and found the chemicals appear to eliminate COVID-19 spores without damaging the mask\u2019s filtration.

When workers reuse and re-wear the masks, they can lose their shape, which undermines the quality of fit and renders them less protective. For some masks, per an N95 report on hydrogen peroxide, fit quality declined substantially after just five uses. For others, it took 15 wears to see a meaningful difference. At Yale-New Haven, Kenney said, the hospital discards 20% to 30% of respirators that could have been refurbished before they hit the 20-reuse mark because they had sustained too much wear and tear.

Many hospitals and state lawmakers blame Washington, saying the Trump administration has not done enough to make this critical protective gear available. But at a recent press conference, President Donald Trump suggested those claims are overblown, asserting instead that hospitals have the tools they need to sanitize and reuse protective facewear. \"\"We\u2019re also using a sterilization process \u2015 some great equipment that will sterilize masks up to 20 times per mask. So that\u2019s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it\u2019s working very well,\"\" Trump said at the April 23 briefing. In fact, the question of reusing masks \u2014 specifically, the highly effective N95 respirators that best protect wearers from COVID-19 \u2015 has emerged as a major worker-safety concern. Traditionally, the masks have been designated only for single use. But with hospitals running low on protective equipment, many seek to stretch their supplies. With that context, we were curious \u2014 can N95s be sterilized and reused, as Trump suggested? And if so, are disinfected masks as protective as new ones? We contacted the White House but never heard back. Our own research revealed the situation is more complex than Trump suggested. Hospitals are using new technology to sterilize masks. Some procedures do show promise. Still, according to experts we consulted, it\u2019s an overstatement to suggest they are as effective as getting new equipment. Trump appears to be referencing technology from the Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit technology company in Ohio. Battelle, which has an in-house \"\"critical care decontamination system,\"\" received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to sanitize N95s for reuse. Hospitals send used N95s to Battelle, which has also set up N95 sanitization centers in coronavirus hot spots, including New York, Boston, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Workers wearing protective gear load the respirators into a sealed container. Masks are cleaned with vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide, aerated and then sent back to the originating hospitals. The decontamination process takes about 12 hours. A mask\u2019s round-trip journey from a hospital to Battelle in Ohio and back again can take about 10 days. Battelle said masks can withstand the decontamination process up to 20 times without losing their ability to filter out viral particles. So, the president is right that this technology exists. But is it fair to say the approach is the equivalent of buying new gear? Put simply, no. Experts are clear that decontamination works in the current emergency. But \u2015 despite Trump\u2019s enthusiasm \u2014 it is not a best practice. \"\"It\u2019s not accurate to say that reprocessing respirators is as good as purchasing 20 of them,\"\" said Dr. Patrick Kenney, medical director of Yale-New Haven Health\u2019s supply chain, who has also researched decontamination technology and processing. \"\"This is not a renewable resource. The respirators are intended for single use.\"\" In fact, in its letter designating emergency approval, the FDA specified that Battelle\u2019s decontamination system \"\"may be effective\"\" at protecting wearers but advised it specifically for \"\"when there are insufficient supplies.\"\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends reuse \"\"only be practiced as a crisis capacity strategy.\"\" The reasons are multiple.

However, stating that this is 'like ordering 20 times more masks' is misleading and oversimplifies the situation. Experts and evidence indicate that while reusing sterilized masks can extend their life in a crisis, it does not equate to the effectiveness or safety of using new masks. Issues such as the potential degradation of mask fit and filtration efficacy after multiple sterilizations, and the complex logistics involved in safely reusing N95 masks, make the equivalence to purchasing new masks inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is partially true in that the technology exists, but false in implying that it is as effective as having new masks."}

We searched that particular issue, and Trump appeared on the November 9, 1992 cover under the text: \u201cFighting Back, Trump Scrambles Off the Canvas.\u201dOn page 41 of the issue, what appears to be a paraphrase by author Julie Baumgold appeared:The final paragraph above appeared to be the author\u2019s paraphrasing of Trump\u2019s sentiments\u00a0toward women he perceived as seeking attention (even negative attention) from powerful men:[Trump\u2019s] contempt for beautiful women who like to be abused is boundless, and he is full of stories of supermodels, women he might call twelves (not their size), clinging to a rockstar\u2019s legs and the rock star kicking them away. You have to treat them like s\u2014. He\u2019s seen the disloyalty of wives and widows; a \u201cdisloyal lady\u201d like Barbara Walters, who asked him about his divorce on TV when she promised she wouldn\u2019t; and major babes who fall for guys with voices and guitars.

[Quotation.] Women are two types for him \u2014 those of use, and those he beds, or \u201csacks,\u201d and, of the two, the former probably get more of his heart.That excerpt featured the author\u2019s\u00a0characterization\u00a0of Trump in the profile, based on the writer\u2019s personal observations. In that appearance, the quote is part of a pastiche of commentary made by Trump himself and descriptors appended by that journalist, such as the \u201ctwo types of women\u201d commentary.However, the quote appears a second time on page 43 of the same issue, that time in a different context. Philip Johnson, the individual referenced, is a noted architect\u00a0who worked on Trump\u2019s casino around the period the article was published:In the screenshot above, the second appearance of the quotation appears in the second complete paragraph on the left. It appears to represent half of a conversation, the other half to which readers were not privy. It begins with a setting (the \u201cearly-morning hours\u201d and a \u201ccasino floor\u201d), and the relevant part begins:Philip Johnson looks at his watch. He is going to Berlin this evening to design a building at Checkpoint Charlie. Trump is talking about women and says \u201cYou have to treat \u2019em like s\u2014.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d make a good mafioso,\u201d says Johnson.\u201cOne of the greatest,\u201d says Donald as the car glides through the protected pinelands into the corrupted city.Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson. Tyson told Trump the woman who put him in jail \u201cwanted it real bad.\u201d Trump feels Tyson is doing time on a bad rap: \u201cShe knocked on his door at 1 AM and was up and dancing at eight the next morning.\u201d This speech is another of the set pieces he is so fond of delivering. When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and community service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice to him for the first time in his 46 years.Based on the format of the article, which jumped around and featured quotes without preceding context, Donald Trump may have been more broadly voicing his negative opinion of a woman who accused boxer Mike Tyson of rape in the early 1990s. Tyson was convicted and jailed in February 1992; the boxer was imprisoned when the Trump profile ran in November of that year.From the context, it was difficult to discern whether Trump\u2019s \u201cyou\u00a0have to treat \u2019em like shit\u201d comment was spoken outside the context of Tyson, as part of his distaste for the decision to convict his friend, or in some other context not provided.However, the citation on page 41 provided the quote in paraphrase form, in a broader characterization of Trump\u2019s commentary\u00a0about powerful men and the bad behavior women \u201callowed\u201d them to indulge in. Additionally confusing was that a nearly exact version of the phrase was presented as a direct quote attributed to Trump two pages later. In that portion, the writer claims Trump was \u201ctalking about women\u201d and said \u201cyou have to treat \u2019em like [shit. ]\u201dTrump denied making the remarks in any context in a 2016\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0interview:[Interviewer]: Let\u2019s talk about women. Your feelings toward them seem conflicted, even chauvinistic, confusing since you adore and respect your mother so much. [Trump]: I have great relationships with women, my mother, Ivana, Marla, my female executives are better than the men: tougher, smarter. [Interviewer]: So why in 1992 did you tell a writer for New York magazine, Marie Brenner, that \u2018You have to treat women like shit\u201d \u2014 ultimately pouring a bottle of wine down her back? [Trump]: I didn\u2019t say that. The woman\u2019s a liar, extremely unattractive, lots of problems because of her looks. [Interviewer]: That statement is exactly why women think you\u2019re a chauvinist pig. [Trump]: They\u2019re right \u2014 and not. People say, \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d but there\u2019s a truth in it, in a modified form. Psychologists will tell you that some women want to be treated with respect, others differently. I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, \u201cBe rougher and you\u2019ll see a different relationship.\u2019 Unfortunately, with people in general, you get more with vinegar than honey.That interview mentions Marie Brenner, a\u00a0Vanity Fair writer who profiled Trump in 1991; Brenner accused Trump of pouring wine on her because he was displeased about something she\u2019d written. The interview appeared to conflate Brenner, upon whom Trump had purportedly poured wine, and Baumgold, author of the 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.Confusion may have also stemmed from what appeared to be the first post-candidacy appearance of the claim via The Daily Beast in 2015, which mentioned both the wine claim as well as the quote from a conversation with Johnson. In March 2016, the quote in it\u2019s \u201cwomen, you have to \u2026\u201d form appeared in an attack ad.According to Baumgold, Trump was talking about women when he made the remarks, but their complete context did not appear in the piece. \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d presented a modified version of the quote, attributing the phrase to Trump as such: \u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d Although Baumgold broadly reported Trump was speaking about women when he said \u201cyou have to treat them like [shit],\u201d the complete context of the quote was missing.","sources":"https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-this-the-newest-and-clearest-photo-of-pluto\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Did+Donald+Trump+Say+%27Women%2C+You+Have+to+Treat+Them+Like+S---%27+in+a+1992+Interview%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA41&vq=%22babes%20are%20bad%22&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q=%22you%20have%20to%20treat%20them%20like%20s%22&f=false, https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/vb8pq3\/women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit-new-ad-highlights-trumps-statements-on-women, https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/you-have-to-treat-em-like-shit-before-megyn-kelly-trump-dumped-wine-on-a-female-reporter, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/donald-trump-women-unearthed-1994-primetime-interview-nancy-collins-938176, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OccupyDemocrats\/posts\/3042002795892754, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/archive.fo\/BeEY2, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/boxing-legend-convicted-of-raping-beauty-queen, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-upper-case-and-lower-case-originally-refer-to-where-printers-kept-their-letters\/, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&q=%22babes+are+bad%22#v=onepage&q=mafioso&f=false, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/tag\/occupy-democrats\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-an-arkansas-republican-propose-cutting-free-lunches-to-punish-students\/, https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/frontline\/interview\/marie-brenner\/, https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/dept-of-design\/philip-johnson-the-man-who-made-architecture-amoral, https:\/\/hoax-alert.leadstories.com\/3470895-fake-news-donald-trump-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit.html","label":3,"subjects":"Disinformation, Fact Checks","__index_level_0__":4178,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn September 14 2019 the popular \u2014 but not always accurate \u2014 Facebook page \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d shared a Donald Trump quote meme\u00a0(archived here), alleging that the President said \u201cwomen, you have to treat them like shit\u201d in a 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.To the right of an image of President Trump, text stated:\u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, 1992,\u00a0New York MagazineThis is an ACTUAL Trump quote, AND THE PART OF \u201cFAMILY VALUES\u201d COULDN\u2019T CARE LESS!The meme\u2019s claim was presented in the second part of the text, that \u201cyou have to treat [women] like shit\u201d was an \u201cactual Trump quote.\u201d The group helpfully provided a specific citation window, namely a 1992 article in\u00a0New York Magazine.As our friends at Lead Stories pointed out,\u00a0New York Magazine\u2018s archives from 1992 were searchable on Google Books.

Tyson was convicted and jailed in February 1992; the boxer was imprisoned when the Trump profile ran in November of that year.From the context, it was difficult to discern whether Trump\u2019s \u201cyou\u00a0have to treat \u2019em like shit\u201d comment was spoken outside the context of Tyson, as part of his distaste for the decision to convict his friend, or in some other context not provided.However, the citation on page 41 provided the quote in paraphrase form, in a broader characterization of Trump\u2019s commentary\u00a0about powerful men and the bad behavior women \u201callowed\u201d them to indulge in. Additionally confusing was that a nearly exact version of the phrase was presented as a direct quote attributed to Trump two pages later. In that portion, the writer claims Trump was \u201ctalking about women\u201d and said \u201cyou have to treat \u2019em like [shit. ]\u201dTrump denied making the remarks in any context in a 2016\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0interview:[Interviewer]: Let\u2019s talk about women. Your feelings toward them seem conflicted, even chauvinistic, confusing since you adore and respect your mother so much. [Trump]: I have great relationships with women, my mother, Ivana, Marla, my female executives are better than the men: tougher, smarter. [Interviewer]: So why in 1992 did you tell a writer for New York magazine, Marie Brenner, that \u2018You have to treat women like shit\u201d \u2014 ultimately pouring a bottle of wine down her back? [Trump]: I didn\u2019t say that. The woman\u2019s a liar, extremely unattractive, lots of problems because of her looks. [Interviewer]: That statement is exactly why women think you\u2019re a chauvinist pig. [Trump]: They\u2019re right \u2014 and not. People say, \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d but there\u2019s a truth in it, in a modified form. Psychologists will tell you that some women want to be treated with respect, others differently. I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, \u201cBe rougher and you\u2019ll see a different relationship.\u2019 Unfortunately, with people in general, you get more with vinegar than honey.That interview mentions Marie Brenner, a\u00a0Vanity Fair writer who profiled Trump in 1991; Brenner accused Trump of pouring wine on her because he was displeased about something she\u2019d written. The interview appeared to conflate Brenner, upon whom Trump had purportedly poured wine, and Baumgold, author of the 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.Confusion may have also stemmed from what appeared to be the first post-candidacy appearance of the claim via The Daily Beast in 2015, which mentioned both the wine claim as well as the quote from a conversation with Johnson. In March 2016, the quote in it\u2019s \u201cwomen, you have to \u2026\u201d form appeared in an attack ad.According to Baumgold, Trump was talking about women when he made the remarks, but their complete context did not appear in the piece. \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d presented a modified version of the quote, attributing the phrase to Trump as such: \u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d Although Baumgold broadly reported Trump was speaking about women when he said \u201cyou have to treat them like [shit],\u201d the complete context of the quote was missing.n\nClaim: \"In 1992, Donald Trump said \"\"women, you have to treat them like shit.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that Donald Trump said 'women, you have to treat them like shit' in 1992 is partially true and false because, while he was quoted saying 'you have to treat \u2019em like shit' in a 1992 New York Magazine article, the context in which this statement was made is not fully clear and the quote appears in a paraphrased form. Additionally, Trump's comments were part of a larger conversation about a specific case involving Mike Tyson, rather than a general statement about all women. Furthermore, Trump has denied making the statement in the manner it has been presented. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified as true or false without considering the nuances and context in which the statement appeared."}
