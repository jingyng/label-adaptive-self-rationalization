It plans by June to boost production to \u201chigh double-digit millions\u201d per month, with the tests due to be run on more than 40,000 of Roche\u2019s cobas e testing machines installed worldwide. The test identifies antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the body, suggesting possible immunity.

Diasorin SpA of Italy is among those developing an antibody test which it hopes to put to use this month. Chief Executive Carlo Rosa told Reuters last week that demand is immense, a situation that parallels the global scramble for ventilators to keep critically ill patients alive. \u201cWe won\u2019t be in a position to respond to the enormous demand that there will be for these tests on our own,\u201d said Rosa, adding Diasorin has 5,000 testing platforms installed globally, including 500 in Italy, which can process 170 samples an hour.

In fact, when auto executives were confronted by regulators for their contributions to pollution, they pointed to the lawn industry as a more offensive culprit.

At Briggs & Stratton, for example, Teske said emissions have been cut by 75 percent since the mid-1990s thanks to manufacturing upgrades and design improvements. Another 35 percent reduction will come in 2012. The auto and other industries are under constant pressure to raise fuel economy or tap new technologies because their customers often burn through dozens or more gallons of gasoline each month. As gas prices rise, so does the strain on pocketbooks. But outdoor equipment users don\u2019t face these pressures. \u201cPeople who use our products typically use no more than five gallons of gasoline per year,\u201d Keiser said.

By 2013, Jore plans to have a broader range of products, including a lawn mower and leaf blower that don\u2019t use gas. But even the most established global players are finding it hard to turn the tide. Honda Motor Co sells thousands of hybrid snow blowers in Japan annually and is bringing a hybrid model to the United States. This model promises to be the Cadillac of its class, capable of clearing 83 tons of snow in an hour and sweep a city sidewalk in one pass. But, at $8,000, this machine is twice as expensive as the company\u2019s previous top-of-the-line model, and hybrid technology is driving up the cost. Honda\u2019s expectations for sales of the Japan-built hybrid are extremely modest, but it wants to test the market before committing to other alternative-energy models. If Wisconsin-based Ariens Co\u2019s experience during last year\u2019s tough winter is any indication, there may be hope for Honda. Ariens put on sale an electric snow blower priced 60 percent higher than a conventional model.

According to the report, more than 9,000 children age 12 and younger died in a car crash from 2002 to 2011. \u201cThe good news is motor vehicle deaths decreased by 43 percent over the past decade for children age 12 and younger. The tragic news is still with that decrease, more than 9,000 kids were killed on the road in this period,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference. \u201cThousands of children are at risk on the road because they are not buckled up,\u201d he said. The study found that of the children who died between 2009 to 2010, a much higher proportion of black and Hispanic children were not buckled, compared with white kids. \u201cThe difference was nearly half (45 percent for blacks and 46 percent for Hispanics) versus a quarter (26 percent) for white kids,\u201d Frieden said. The study did not investigate why racial differences played such a big role in seat belt use, but it did suggest socio-economic factors may play a role. For the study, CDC researchers analyzed data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find the number of deaths among occupants in cars from 2002 to 2011 for all children aged up to the age of 12.

It seems to compare the number of beds at different times of the year, but the number available fluctuates seasonally. Comparing July-September in 2010 and 2017, the decrease in beds available overnight in England is closer to 13,200. 66 A&E and maternity wards have been closed. We don\u2019t know, as this information isn\u2019t collected nationally. In 2014, there were reportedly plans to close or downgrade 66 in England, but while some have been, others have stayed open. 103 NHS walk-in centres have closed or been downgraded since 2010. We don\u2019t know exactly, as this information isn\u2019t collected centrally. Research from an NHS regulator and from campaign group 38 Degrees suggests more than 90 have been closed or downgraded. 60 ambulance stations have closed since 2010. We don\u2019t know how many ambulance stations have closed since 2010 as national figures on this aren\u2019t regularly published. 1,000 GP practices have closed since 2010. There are around 1,000 fewer GP practices in England in 2017 than in 2010. Some practices may have merged together, rather than closing completely, but we don\u2019t know how many have done so. A&E four hour targets have been missed more than 10 million times since 2010. Correct. Between 2010\/11 and 2017\/18, around 12 million A&E attendances in England took over four hours from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. The number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&E is up 2,700% since 2010. Correct (although not all patients will necessarily have been waiting in A&E). In 2011\/12, 120 patients in England waited 12 hours between the decision to admit them to emergency admissions and their actual admission, compared to 3,500 in 2017\/18. Spending on social care is down 8% since 2010. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said that between 2009\/10 and 2016\/17, councils\u2019 spending on adult social care in England fell 8% in real terms. Newer analysis says that it fell by 6% over the same period. We\u2019ve asked it for more information. There are 5,240 fewer mental health nurses since 2010. This seems to be looking at different months in 2010 and 2017, which isn\u2019t the best comparison. Comparing the number of full-time equivalent mental health nurses between January 2010 and January 2018 (the latest figures), the drop is closer to 4,500. The number of operations classed as urgent that have been cancelled twice have doubled since 2010. Correct. The number of urgent operations in England cancelled for the second time or more for non-medical reasons more than doubled between 2011\/12 and 2017\/18.

This is in the right ballpark, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be the best comparison. It seems to compare the number of beds at different times of the year, but the number available fluctuates seasonally. Comparing July-September in 2010 and 2017, the decrease in beds available overnight in England is closer to 13,200. 66 A&E and maternity wards have been closed. We don\u2019t know, as this information isn\u2019t collected nationally. In 2014, there were reportedly plans to close or downgrade 66 in England, but while some have been, others have stayed open. 103 NHS walk-in centres have closed or been downgraded since 2010. We don\u2019t know exactly, as this information isn\u2019t collected centrally. Research from an NHS regulator and from campaign group 38 Degrees suggests more than 90 have been closed or downgraded. 60 ambulance stations have closed since 2010. We don\u2019t know how many ambulance stations have closed since 2010 as national figures on this aren\u2019t regularly published. 1,000 GP practices have closed since 2010. There are around 1,000 fewer GP practices in England in 2017 than in 2010. Some practices may have merged together, rather than closing completely, but we don\u2019t know how many have done so. A&E four hour targets have been missed more than 10 million times since 2010. Correct. Between 2010\/11 and 2017\/18, around 12 million A&E attendances in England took over four hours from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. The number of patients waiting more than 12 hours in A&E is up 2,700% since 2010. Correct (although not all patients will necessarily have been waiting in A&E). In 2011\/12, 120 patients in England waited 12 hours between the decision to admit them to emergency admissions and their actual admission, compared to 3,500 in 2017\/18. Spending on social care is down 8% since 2010. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said that between 2009\/10 and 2016\/17, councils\u2019 spending on adult social care in England fell 8% in real terms. Newer analysis says that it fell by 6% over the same period. We\u2019ve asked it for more information. There are 5,240 fewer mental health nurses since 2010. This seems to be looking at different months in 2010 and 2017, which isn\u2019t the best comparison. Comparing the number of full-time equivalent mental health nurses between January 2010 and January 2018 (the latest figures), the drop is closer to 4,500. The number of operations classed as urgent that have been cancelled twice have doubled since 2010. Correct. The number of urgent operations in England cancelled for the second time or more for non-medical reasons more than doubled between 2011\/12 and 2017\/18.

{"claim_id":34167,"hypothesis":"U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. ","date_published":"October 23, 2019","explanation_1":"In reality, the only consistent feature of these incidents is the inconsistency of the circumstances and context that surrounded them. As such, it appears doubtful that Trump typically brandishes his middle finger as a way of expressing disdain or anger or disrespect. A far more plausible explanation appears to be simply that, from time to time, the president\u2019s hairline or eyebrows or skin cause him irritation or discomfort, and he feels compelled to scratch that itch.","fact_checkers":"Dan MacGuill","premise":"In October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made. Anti-gun violence activist Shannon Watts tweeted out a short video clip of the incident, writing: \u201cWhen gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u2018fix\u2019 his hair. How is this even real life?\u201d When gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u201cfix\u201d his hair. How is this even real life? pic.twitter.com\/9bnj7XfY1m \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 21, 2019 \u00a0 The left-leaning Facebook page The Other 98% repurposed Watts\u2019 viral tweet in a video:  Jack Brown, whose Twitter bio describes him as a \u201cbody language and emotional intelligence expert,\u201d posted a lengthy and widely shared analysis of the president\u2019s non-verbal gestures during the incident, concluding that: \u201cThis gesture is very much what it looks like \u2014 Donald Trump is giving Astronaut Jessica Meir the finger while she\u2019s walking in space. He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201d","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":5202,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made.

But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201dn\nClaim: U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that U.S. President Donald Trump intentionally used his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who corrected him cannot be confirmed due to the lack of definitive evidence about his intent behind the gesture. The analysis and additional incidents provided show that Trump has used similar gestures in various contexts, some of which are benign and not directed at any individual in a negative manner. Without clear evidence or confirmation of Trump's intent to use the gesture as an offensive signal specifically in the incident with the astronaut, it remains speculative to conclude the gesture was meant as an act of disrespect."}

The story unfolded when bystander video emerged of Clinton nearly fainting and stumbling from a curb before her aids loaded her into a van after a 9\/11 event in New York. The situation played into conspiracy theories that Clinton has been hiding a major medical condition, most likely Parkinson\u2019s disease. Clinton\u2019s doctor, Lisa Bardack, released a statement saying that Clinton had been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia during a follow up visit on Friday: She was put on antibiotics, and was advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at (Sunday\u2019s) event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.

No information is currently\u00a0available as to whether Graves and the brand managed to come to an agreement about circumstances under which the specimen could be tested, and the claim remains unproven.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 9 May 2016, a Texas man named John Graves published several photographs to Facebook alongside a claim that he had discovered a dead rat in his grandson\u2019s partially-consumed bottle of Dr Pepper: Graves\u2019 status update read: Nothing like your grandson drinking half a Dr Pepper only to find a dead rat floating on the bottle. Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman\u2019s 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy\u2019s chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny.

Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston. Dr Pepper tells Channel 2 it would be happy to send the rodent to a qualified lab in Texas; however, at this point the only qualified lab the company is aware of is Alteca LTD in Kansas. Food safety expert Jay Neal told the outlet that it was possible (but not probable) that a rodent could wind up in a sealed bottle of soda, noting that rats and mice were capable of entering small spaces. While Neal said the claim could be accurate, he also explained why it was an unlikely scenario, noting a small window during which such contamination could occur: It\u2019s washing the bottle, it\u2019s filling the bottle, it\u2019s putting the cap on the bottle, it\u2019s putting the label on the bottle, all in less than 15 seconds[.] In response to the viral controversy, Dr Pepper released a statement that described\u00a0the claim as \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d and that testing would take six to eight weeks from the date of receipt. In their statement, the brand maintained that the laboratory would be an independent third party (as Graves said he sought): Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well-being of our consumers. We take all consumer complaints very seriously, are very concerned about the call we received today from Mr. Graves and are investigating it as best as we can. What we know from our experience is that given the controls and safeguards we have in our production facilities it is virtually impossible for any foreign object to enter any container during the bottling process. All of our containers enter our facility on pallets in our warehouse and remain covered until the moment they are placed on our high-speed filling lines. Once on the filling lines, they are inverted and rinsed out before they are filled and capped. We have offered to dispatch a courier to pick up the product to take it out for testing by a third party forensics laboratory, but the consumer has declined this request. This lab would be able to analyze any rodent that got into the product, determine how it entered the container and even inspect the contents of its stomach. This process can take 6-8 weeks to yield conclusive findings. Until we have the opportunity to review the contents, we don\u2019t have a way to do a full investigation.\u201d While\u00a0Graves\u2019 story\u00a0has not been explicitly disproven, skeptics pointed out that it showed many similarities to a man\u2019s 2015 claim that KFC served him a battered, fried rat, a\u00a0story that was\u00a0later revealed to be a hoax. It was also similar to a woman\u2019s 2005 claim that she discovered a severed finger in Wendy\u2019s chili, which later unraveled under scrutiny. Yet another, similar claim was disproven after experts said that\u00a0Mountain Dew\u00a0(and other soft drinks)\u00a0could dissolve a mouse, thanks to the acids that incorporated into their flavoring agents to give them a tanginess and bite.

Although Dr Pepper has deemed such an occurrence 'virtually impossible' due to their stringent bottling processes, they have also expressed willingness to test the bottle and rat to determine the validity of the claim. However, without conclusive results from independent testing or an investigation that confirms how the rat could have entered the bottle, there is not enough information to definitively declare the claim true or false."}

We made several calls before we finally came up with a solid source that confirmed the new law requires providers to cover sterilization without cost to the patient. According to the U.S. Health Resource and Services Administration, services that fall under \"\"women's preventive health care\"\" are supposed to be covered for free, including mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, contraception, sexually transmitted infection counseling and \u2013 yes \u2013\"\"sterilization procedures.\"\" As for the more salient detail \u2013 the age of consent in Oregon \u2013 we found a piece of Oregon law, which states that \"\"a minor 15 years of age or older may give consent, without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor, to: Hospital care, medical or surgical diagnosis or treatment by a physician licensed by the Oregon Medical Board \u2026\"\"  Essentially, CNSNews.com linked those two pieces of information \u2013 the new requirements that insurance companies cover sterilization for free and the fact that Oregon's age of consent for health care is 15 years old. The idea that 15-year-old girls would be lining up for free on-demand sterilizations struck our readers either as scary - \"\"Is this true?\"\" - or ridiculous - \"\"This can't be true.\"\" We kept reporting. We checked whether sterilization had always been covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state-run health care insurance program that covers 600,000 people a month. We called Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Alissa Robbins, who confirmed that it has been included since the plan's inception in 1994. We also asked how many 15-, 16 \u2013 and 17-year-olds had received sterilizations under the plan. Robbins checked records for the last 10 years and found no sterilization procedure for a 15-year-old or a 16-year-old. As for 17-year-olds, she said, at most one such procedure is performed each year, though some years none is performed. She couldn't tell us the reason, she said, because it was \"\"protected health information.\"\" However, it seems clear to us that the procedure for young women in that age bracket is exceedingly rare. Robbins also pointed us to ORS 436, which lays out the warnings and consent procedures for anyone seeking sterilization, including minors. If a physician feels a minor is not capable of making an informed consent to be sterilized, her only recourse is to go to court and ask a judge to order that she is. We also checked with OHSU Hospital to see what the process would be for a minor looking to be sterilized there. Spokeswoman Tamara Hargens-Bradley got back to us with a lengthy email. For any patient under 30, she said, the hospital offers counseling about \"\"long-acting reversible contraceptives\"\" and \"\"the risk of regret\"\" in young women who are sterilized. The \"\"most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization,\"\" she wrote, \"\"is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening.\"\" If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. \"\"(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent.\"\" She ended on this note: \"\"The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient. It requires that insurance plans cover all contraceptives available.\"\" After some vacation phone tag, we were able to talk to Michael Chapman, the CNSNews.com managing editor who had worked closely with the story's author, an intern who is no longer there. \"\"Our story is factual,\"\" Chapman said. \"\"Out story reports what the law is in Oregon and it reports what the federal regulation is.\"\" Chapman said the article was stymied in part by little response from the Oregon Health Authority. \"\"It's great they're willing to say more now that the story has come out. \"\"Nearly all health insurers must provide sterilization ... that's a fact.\"\" In a subsequent email, Chapman pointed out language on the Oregon Health Authority's consent to sterilization form that reads \"\"I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me.\"\" The form is the last step in many checks and balances that is only signed after the patient finds a physician willing to perform the procedure. Now let's pull this together. Our reporting found that it's true that the health care act requires sterilizations to be free. It's also true that 15-year-olds can consent to health care without parental consent. But CNSNews.com goes even further by alleging that \"\"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.\"\" The statement would be accurate if it said health care plans in Oregon are required to pay for sterilizations for 15-year-old-girls. But instead, the statement confuses the insurers with providers \u2013 i.e. physicians \u2013 stating that 15-year-olds have \"\"complete control.\"\" That's not true. What a 15-year-old girl may want and what a medical provider is willing to do, at least in this case, are two very different things. Health care providers are under no obligation to provide sterilization on demand. In fact, free sterilization is not available on demand for 15-year-olds in Oregon. A 15-year-old must first convince a doctor that the procedure is medically necessary. While sometimes it is -- to treat cancer, for instance --a decade of records from the Oregon Health Plan and the explanation of procedures at OHSU show sterilization of 15-year-olds is incredibly rare. In Oregon, 15-year-old girls do not have \"\"complete control\"\" over whether to be sterilized.

The \"\"most likely scenario in which a teenager would request sterilization,\"\" she wrote, \"\"is if she has a medical condition so severe that pregnancy would be life-threatening.\"\" If sterilization is not needed medically and a teen insists, Hargens-Bradley said the OHSU ethics committee would get involved. \"\"(T)hat would be very unusual and cause concern about whether the patient is capable of providing fully informed consent.\"\" She ended on this note: \"\"The health care reform offering contraception for free does not REQUIRE a physician to provide care they do not feel is safe for the patient. It requires that insurance plans cover all contraceptives available.\"\" After some vacation phone tag, we were able to talk to Michael Chapman, the CNSNews.com managing editor who had worked closely with the story's author, an intern who is no longer there. \"\"Our story is factual,\"\" Chapman said. \"\"Out story reports what the law is in Oregon and it reports what the federal regulation is.\"\" Chapman said the article was stymied in part by little response from the Oregon Health Authority. \"\"It's great they're willing to say more now that the story has come out. \"\"Nearly all health insurers must provide sterilization ... that's a fact.\"\" In a subsequent email, Chapman pointed out language on the Oregon Health Authority's consent to sterilization form that reads \"\"I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me.\"\" The form is the last step in many checks and balances that is only signed after the patient finds a physician willing to perform the procedure. Now let's pull this together. Our reporting found that it's true that the health care act requires sterilizations to be free. It's also true that 15-year-olds can consent to health care without parental consent. But CNSNews.com goes even further by alleging that \"\"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.\"\" The statement would be accurate if it said health care plans in Oregon are required to pay for sterilizations for 15-year-old-girls. But instead, the statement confuses the insurers with providers \u2013 i.e. physicians \u2013 stating that 15-year-olds have \"\"complete control.\"\" That's not true. What a 15-year-old girl may want and what a medical provider is willing to do, at least in this case, are two very different things. Health care providers are under no obligation to provide sterilization on demand. In fact, free sterilization is not available on demand for 15-year-olds in Oregon. A 15-year-old must first convince a doctor that the procedure is medically necessary. While sometimes it is -- to treat cancer, for instance --a decade of records from the Oregon Health Plan and the explanation of procedures at OHSU show sterilization of 15-year-olds is incredibly rare. In Oregon, 15-year-old girls do not have \"\"complete control\"\" over whether to be sterilized. We rule the statement .\"n\nClaim: \"CNSNews Says \"\"under Oregon law, girls from 15 years of age and up are given complete control over whether to be sterilized or not.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"While Oregon law allows 15-year-olds to consent to medical treatments, including sterilization, without parental consent, the claim that they have 'complete control' over the decision to be sterilized is misleading. Health care providers are not obligated to perform sterilization simply because a minor consents to it. Providers consider medical necessity and ethical implications, and often require counseling or additional consent processes before proceeding with such a significant medical procedure. Furthermore, evidence suggests that sterilization procedures on 15-year-olds are exceedingly rare and typically involve significant medical justification. Thus, the claim exaggerates the level of control minors have over the decision to be sterilized, making it false."}

According to the post, \"\"as many as 214,524 American physicians will not be participating in any (Affordable Care Act) exchange products.\"\" It went on to list some reasons \"\"doctors are opting out of the exchange plans.\"\" That\u2019s a lot of doctors. Have that many decided to turn away patients with insurance purchased on the marketplaces? Let\u2019s take a look. Can doctors opt out of Obamacare exchanges? The Affordable Care Act requires essentially everyone to have insurance. To make it easier for people to buy insurance, the government created federal and state insurance marketplaces, sometimes called exchanges. The biggest one is HealthCare.gov, but some states elected to operate their own as well. These marketplace policies are private plans sold by insurance companies. In some states, just one or two companies are providing plans; in others, it\u2019s many. Consumers typically have dozens of choices ranging from bronze policies, which pay 60 percent of health costs on average, to platinum, which pay 90 percent of costs. (For comparison, a typical employer-based plan covers about 80 percent of costs.) Can doctors choose not to participate in the networks of policies purchased on exchanges? Sure. While some states require doctors to accept any plan for an insurance provider they do business with, in most cases insurance companies are constantly negotiating with physicians and hospitals to determine which policy networks they will participate in, experts and industry officials told us. Some doctors might decide they don\u2019t want to be in the network of plans purchased on federal or state marketplaces. In other instances, insurance providers might choose not to include certain doctors or health groups in policies they created for the marketplaces. It\u2019s a two-way street, and marketplace policies are just the latest twist to a contracting process that has always existed between doctors and insurance companies. 200,000 doctors? We asked American Action Forum to explain their analysis to us. The organization based its findings on an April survey from the Medical Group Management Association, a trade organization for physician groups. \"\"The survey found that 23.5 percent of doctors said they would not participate in (Affordable Care Act) exchange plans,\"\" said Marisol Garibay, spokeswoman for American Action Forum. That percentage was multiplied by the total number of professional active physicians, which Kaiser Family Foundation estimates is 893,851. That equals 210,054 doctors, close to the American Action Forum number. Garibay called it an \"\"upper bound\"\" estimate. But when we looked at the survey ourselves, we found this to be a pretty dubious figure. Here\u2019s the rub, from the research: \"\"The survey includes responses from more than 700 medical groups in which more than 40,000 physicians practice nationwide.\"\" While there\u2019s a lot of interesting information gleaned from this survey, the results cannot be extrapolated to represent all the doctors in the country. Why not? Because the Medical Group Management Association only represents doctors who are part of medical groups. This does not include physicians who run independent practices, for example, and there\u2019s no reason that a poll of 700 medical groups is representative of all 900,000 physicians in the country. \"\"That\u2019s a significant difference,\"\" said Anders Gilberg, a senior vice president of government affairs for Medical Group Management Association. \"\"I wouldn\u2019t generally suggest using it as a proxy for all physicians.\"\" Let\u2019s put that aside for a second and dig further. The survey found that as of April, 76.5 percent of respondents were accepting health insurance sold on a state or federal marketplace. Of those not participating in marketplace policies, 42 percent said it was because insurance companies in their area didn\u2019t ask them to participate in the networks of plans sold on marketplaces. Meaning, even if this limited survey could be extrapolated to represent all doctors, not all of them are \"\"opting out\"\" of Obamacare. Many \u2014 almost half \u2014 weren\u2019t asked to participate in ACA marketplace policies. Why weren\u2019t they asked? One reason is that the insurance companies want to limit which doctors will serve their customers by creating narrow networks. Narrow networks are a way for insurance providers to keep costs lower for insurers. How? If you create a narrow network, it guarantees a doctor will get a bigger share of your patients, and a doctor would be willing to accept lower reimbursement rates in exchange for more business. Narrow networks are also more common on the exchanges because consumers can pick the plan with the doctors that fit their needs, said Paul Ginsburg, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at University of Southern California. \"\"Employer plans tend to have a broad network because they\u2019re trying to satisfy everyone (at the company),\"\" Ginsburg said. \"\"On an exchange, you don\u2019t have to satisfy everyone with one policy, you can offer many, so you can have narrower plans.\"\" There are plenty of broad plans on the exchanges, they just tend to be more expensive. According to a May survey of individuals likely to use the marketplace, 54 percent said they would accept more limited networks to get a cheaper sticker price. As it is, 85 percent of plans bought on federal and state marketplaces were the less expensive bronze or silver plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To be sure, it appears some doctors want nothing to do with these cheaper marketplace plans or the customers who buy them. Among other things, doctors worry that many of the plans on the marketplace, particularly bronze and silver plans, have high deductibles. Some patients won\u2019t be able to meet their obligations for cost-sharing, potentially forcing physicians to eat those costs or shake down customers. These are legitimate concerns, and there is reason to believe that some doctors are choosing not to contract with marketplace insurance plans.

It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that \"\"the word is out\"\" when in fact it was only Reid who put that \"\"word\"\" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up.\"","fact_checkers":"Louis Jacobson","premise":"\"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney\u2019s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn\u2019t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, \"\"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\"\" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, \"\"Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.\"\" Reid continued, \"\"He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,\"\" said Reid. \"\"But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? \u2026 You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.\"\" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, \"\"As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.\"\" And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, \"\"I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years.\"\" Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. \"\"Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,\"\" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, \"\"Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign.\"\" Other Republicans leaped to Romney\u2019s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that \"\"I think he\u2019s lying\"\") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a \"\"dirty liar\"\" on ABC\u2019s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times\u2019 Frank Bruni called Reid\u2019s charges part of an \"\"unbecoming, corrosive game.\"\" \"\"Spew first and sweat the details later, or never,\"\" Bruni wrote. \"\"Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That\u2019s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late.\"\" Many readers asked us to put Reid\u2019s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney\u2019s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he\u2019s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it\u2019s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney\u2019s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it\u2019s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, \"\"probably not.\"\" The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it\u2019s \"\"highly unlikely\"\" that he paid nothing. \"\"It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn\u2019t taxed until sold and may never be sold,\"\" Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, \"\"But Romney\u2019s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It\u2019s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said.\"\" Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it\u2019s theoretically possible, it\u2019s also \"\"preposterous.\"\" \"\"Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate,\"\" the article said. \"\"But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney.\"\" We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. \"\"I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years,\"\" White said. Our ruling Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that \"\"the word is out\"\" when in fact it was only Reid who put that \"\"word\"\" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. !\"","sources":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_162-57486998-503544\/gop-chairman-harry-reid-is-a-dirty-liar-on-romney-tax-return-issue\/, https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/8301-503544_162-57486520-503544\/romney-to-harry-reid-i-pay-a-lot-of-taxes\/?tag=contentMain;contentBody, http:\/\/www.mittromney.com\/learn\/mitt\/tax-return\/2011\/wmr-adr-return, http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-congress\/2012\/08\/reid-extremely-credible-source-said-romney-didnt-pay-130987.html, http:\/\/www.mittromney.com\/learn\/mitt\/tax-return\/2010\/wmr-adr-return, http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2012\/08\/01\/did_romney_pay_zero_taxes\/, https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/CREC-2012-08-02\/pdf\/CREC-2012-08-02-pt1-PgS5901-5.pdf#page=1, http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2012\/07\/31\/harry-reid-romney-taxes_n_1724027.html, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/08\/05\/opinion\/sunday\/bruni-truculence-before-truth.html?_r=1&ref=frankbruni, http:\/\/content.usatoday.com\/communities\/onpolitics\/post\/2012\/08\/harry-reid-mitt-romney-taxes-dirty-liar-\/1, https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-soi\/12insprbulhignincome.pdf, https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-soi\/08intop400.pdf, http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2010\/02\/17\/a-look-at-the-tax-returns-of-the-top-400-taxpayers\/","label":2,"subjects":"National, Candidate Biography, Taxes, Harry Reid, ","__index_level_0__":7440,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney\u2019s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn\u2019t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, \"\"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\"\" referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, \"\"Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.\"\" Reid continued, \"\"He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain,\"\" said Reid. \"\"But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? \u2026 You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars.\"\" On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, \"\"As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not.\"\" And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, \"\"I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years.\"\" Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. \"\"Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up,\"\" Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, \"\"Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong.

Haslam, schools merger and new legislation","fact_checkers":"Zack McMillin","premise":"\"Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam on whether to allow new schools merger legislation before the completion of work by Shelby County\u2019s Transition Planning Commission. Jan. 12: \"\"My sense is there is a real good-faith effort being made now to come up with the right plan, and I would like to see that play out before anything else happened legislatively.\"\" April 2: \"\"I would just love to see that commission reach the end of their work, come out with a proposal and then let the municipals make a decision. I\u2019ve felt that all along.\"\" May 8: \"\"I\u2019ve made my thoughts clear: I really did want to see the commission have a chance to get their plan out and implemented.\"\" May 9: Haslam signs into law the new state legislation paving the way for Shelby County suburban cities to hold Aug. 2 referendums to create new municipal school districts. As Shelby County awaited Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s decision on what to do when new schools legislation reached his desk, the Memphis-dominated Shelby County Board of Commissioners was already considering how it might respond legally after the bill, allowing Aug. 2 referendums on creating new municipal districts, became law. This despite the fact that Haslam had made statements all year saying he wanted the countywide schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC) to complete its work before any new legislation affecting the merger was enacted. Why the concern over creating a legal strategy to challenge the municipal districts when the governor, who had said he did not want new legislation, had the power to kill the bill with a veto? After all, the legislature had adjourned and speakers of the state House and Senate had said they would not be reconvening, not even to override a veto. But Commissioner Walter Bailey, one of the longest serving public office-holders in the state, said members of that body held little hope that Haslam would provide the veto that in essence would prevent the municipalities from creating new municipal districts before the TPC had completed its work. \"\"He indicates his feelings on one hand but I don\u2019t think his actions have been consistent,\"\" Bailey said. On May 9, Haslam signed the bill. We decided to look at whether, in so doing, the governor had effectively changed his position on whether to endorse new schools legislation before the schools merger commission had completed its work. This is our first use of the Flip-O-Meter in Tennessee, and it's important to stress this from the Flip-O-Meter description: \"\"We are not making a value judgement about flip-flopping. Some people say it shows inconsistent principles and lack of backbone. Others say it's just pragmatism and a willingness to compromise.\"\" Some background is required to understand why this is such a crucial issue for Shelby Countians. Last August, U.S. Dist. Court Judge Samuel \"\"Hardy\"\" Mays ruled that Memphis had followed proper legal procedures in surrendering the charter of its special school district. That \"\"surrender,\"\" in essence, forced consolidation of Memphis City Schools (MCS) with the suburban Shelby County Schools (SCS) system. The judge\u2019s ruling also upheld a new state law, called Public Chapter 1, that set up a transition process culminating in the final transfer MCS to the county system in time for the 2013-14 school year. Chapter 1 also included a clause saying that, upon the completion of merger in the summer of 2013, the statewide ban on municipal or special school districts could be lifted in Shelby County. It took only a few months for the suburban municipalities to put plans in motion to create municipal school districts, with the goal of opening in time for the 2013-14 school year and thus opting out of the merged system. But Haslam, who made one of the 18 appointments to the 21-member schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC), told The Commercial Appeal editorial board in January he wanted the TPC to finish its work before enacting any new legislation that would impact the process. \"\"My sense is there is a real good-faith effort being made now to come up with the right plan, and I would like to see that play out before anything else happened legislatively,\"\" Haslam said. The suburban push for rapid formation of municipal schools, however, came to a halt in early spring when Tennessee Atty. General Bob Cooper advised that no action could be taken to form municipal districts \"\"until from and after the beginning of the 2013-14 school year.\"\" But Senate majority leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, who had authored the suburban-friendly Public Chapter 1 in 2011, had already begun pushing for new legislation that would explicitly allow the suburbs to legally move forward. As Norris moved that new legislation, Haslam on April 2 reiterated his preference for letting the TPC finish its work: \"\"I would just love to see that commission reach the end of their work, come out with a proposal and then let the municipals make a decision. I\u2019ve felt that all along.\"\" TPC chairwoman Barbara Prescott, at an April meeting, said that new legislation enabling municipalities to immediately opt out of the merged system qualified as interference with the process. \"\"I believe we should be able to finish this work under the same legislation that we started,\"\" Prescott said. Norris, however, insisted the new legislation was aimed not at interfering with the process but would instead make the merger process less complicated, by allowing everyone to know on the front end whether the municipalities would or would not be part of the new district. Norris, in the final days of the legislative session, oversaw passage of a bill that, when it became law, would provide for municipal school referendums to be held on Aug. 2. That would allow municipal school board elections in November and lead to a tight but feasible process for starting up in time for the 2013-14 school year. With the legislature adjourned and the new legislation headed his way, Haslam told reporters it was unlikely he would kill the bill with a veto but again stated his position: \"\"I\u2019ve made my thoughts clear: I really did want to see the commission have a chance to get their plan out and implemented.\"\" The past tense indicated where Haslam was headed. In justifying signing the bill or allowing it to become law, Haslam suggested the TPC would be done with its work by June, just ahead of the the July 13 beginning of early voting in the Aug. 2 referendums: \"\"I think their report will be out in June and hopefully the recommendation and the vote won\u2019t be until August so there will be some window to do that. Sometimes that\u2019s just the way the timing works. In a perfect world I\u2019d love for there to be a little bit more time to consider that.\"\" On May 9, without public comment, Haslam signed the bill into law. So a key question here -- maybe the key question -- involves just when the TPC\u2019s \"\"work\"\" will be completed. This document from the TPC lays out the timeline, with different deadlines for various committees and target dates for the TPC to pull everything together. One key date does indeed come in June, as Haslam indicated. By June 14 or June 21, the TPC timeline calls for it to \"\"finalize draft plan.\"\" However, the documents show that is not the end of the process, and it assumes the \"\"draft\"\" plan will undergo significant change. Many more meetings and decisions follow, with a busy four-week \"\"comment period\"\" running from June 25 to July 20. During that comment period, the TPC would engage the public, the unified county school board and the state Department of Education for suggestions about major or minor adjustments and, on July 17, the TPC will hold a session \"\"to review and approve revisions for incorporation into plan.\"\" Another three-week comment session will follow, again including several TPC meetings, again providing for feedback from the school board and the state. On Aug. 9, the TPC would meet, make \"\"live edits to finalize plan\"\" and then, finally, vote on \u00a0\"\"final approval of plan.\"\" At that point, the plan would be submitted to the school board \"\"for up or down approval\"\" and to the state \"\"for endorsement by mid August.\"\" So there will be a \"\"draft plan\"\" by mid-June, as Haslam suggested, but the TPC\u2019s work will be far from complete. Indeed, early voting will begin four days ahead of the TPC even giving final approval to the \"\"draft plan.\"\" A final official plan will not get a vote by the full TPC until Aug. 9 -- at which point suburban municipalities will have already voted to on whether to create their own districts. And even then, the school board and state must give their approvals before it becomes final. It is understandable why Haslam, a Republican governor, would feel compelled to sign legislation strongly favored by Republican-dominated suburbs in Shelby County. It may even, as Norris contends, ultimately be the best thing for the county and the state. But, by not exercising the veto power that would have killed the bill, the governor acted contrary to his earlier\u00a0statements that\u00a0no new schools legislation should be enacted before the schools merger team had completed its work.

Norris, in the final days of the legislative session, oversaw passage of a bill that, when it became law, would provide for municipal school referendums to be held on Aug. 2. That would allow municipal school board elections in November and lead to a tight but feasible process for starting up in time for the 2013-14 school year. With the legislature adjourned and the new legislation headed his way, Haslam told reporters it was unlikely he would kill the bill with a veto but again stated his position: \"\"I\u2019ve made my thoughts clear: I really did want to see the commission have a chance to get their plan out and implemented.\"\" The past tense indicated where Haslam was headed. In justifying signing the bill or allowing it to become law, Haslam suggested the TPC would be done with its work by June, just ahead of the the July 13 beginning of early voting in the Aug. 2 referendums: \"\"I think their report will be out in June and hopefully the recommendation and the vote won\u2019t be until August so there will be some window to do that. Sometimes that\u2019s just the way the timing works. In a perfect world I\u2019d love for there to be a little bit more time to consider that.\"\" On May 9, without public comment, Haslam signed the bill into law. So a key question here -- maybe the key question -- involves just when the TPC\u2019s \"\"work\"\" will be completed. This document from the TPC lays out the timeline, with different deadlines for various committees and target dates for the TPC to pull everything together. One key date does indeed come in June, as Haslam indicated. By June 14 or June 21, the TPC timeline calls for it to \"\"finalize draft plan.\"\" However, the documents show that is not the end of the process, and it assumes the \"\"draft\"\" plan will undergo significant change. Many more meetings and decisions follow, with a busy four-week \"\"comment period\"\" running from June 25 to July 20. During that comment period, the TPC would engage the public, the unified county school board and the state Department of Education for suggestions about major or minor adjustments and, on July 17, the TPC will hold a session \"\"to review and approve revisions for incorporation into plan.\"\" Another three-week comment session will follow, again including several TPC meetings, again providing for feedback from the school board and the state. On Aug. 9, the TPC would meet, make \"\"live edits to finalize plan\"\" and then, finally, vote on \u00a0\"\"final approval of plan.\"\" At that point, the plan would be submitted to the school board \"\"for up or down approval\"\" and to the state \"\"for endorsement by mid August.\"\" So there will be a \"\"draft plan\"\" by mid-June, as Haslam suggested, but the TPC\u2019s work will be far from complete. Indeed, early voting will begin four days ahead of the TPC even giving final approval to the \"\"draft plan.\"\" A final official plan will not get a vote by the full TPC until Aug. 9 -- at which point suburban municipalities will have already voted to on whether to create their own districts. And even then, the school board and state must give their approvals before it becomes final. It is understandable why Haslam, a Republican governor, would feel compelled to sign legislation strongly favored by Republican-dominated suburbs in Shelby County. It may even, as Norris contends, ultimately be the best thing for the county and the state. But, by not exercising the veto power that would have killed the bill, the governor acted contrary to his earlier\u00a0statements that\u00a0no new schools legislation should be enacted before the schools merger team had completed its work. On the Flip-O-Meter, Haslam earns a .\"n\nClaim: On allowing Shelby County's schools merger commission to finish work before allowing any new merger legislation.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"Governor Bill Haslam made multiple statements indicating his preference that the schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC) complete its work before any new legislation impacting the merger process was enacted. Despite these assertions, he signed into law new legislation on May 9 that allowed for the creation of municipal school districts before the TPC had completed its work, specifically before the TPC had finalized and fully approved its merger plan. This action directly contradicts his earlier statements, demonstrating that the claim that he allowed the TPC to finish its work before allowing any new merger legislation is false."}

One of these rumors involved the provision of food stamps for Floridians whose homes had experienced power outages of at least two hours in duration.

Apply at\u00a0disasterassistance.gov FEMA 1-800-621-3362 or 1-800-462-7585 None of these rumors was quite right, and they all seemed to be based on misunderstandings of a federal disaster relief program known as Disaster-SNAP (or D-SNAP), which was\u00a0extended to parts\u00a0of Florida on 22 September 2017. D-SNAP is a program that temporarily extends the benefits usually available under SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps) to individuals affected by natural disasters. One does not have to be an existing recipient of SNAP benefits in order to qualify for D-SNAP, but the latter program does incorporate maximum income limits. D-SNAP assistance typically lasts for one month, but Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on 22 September that the program would be in place for two months in Florida. Recipients are provided with a temporary EBT card containing an amount of credit based upon household size and income. A one-person household with a gross monthly income of $1,664 or less would receive $194 in D-SNAP credit for one month (a figure that may be the source of the \u201c$197 per person\u201d claim in some Facebook rumors). An eight-person household (provided it has a gross monthly income of $4,151 or less) would be eligible to receive $1,169 in D-SNAP assistance (an average of $146 per person). A two-person household (provided it met the income requirements) would be eligible for $357 in benefits, or $179.50 per person. (There is no set benefit amount per person, a common element of the rumors which is misleading.) The extension of D-SNAP in Florida applies to certain counties. A county is considered eligible based upon the percentage of power outages experienced over a period of 72 hours, as well as the level of structural and flood damage suffered. So power outages do play a role in the provision of extended SNAP benefits, but only on the county level. Such benefits come with no requirement that an individual household must have experienced a power outage for \u201cmore than two hours,\u201d or that applicants must provide photographic evidence of such outages. The appropriate place to apply for Disaster-SNAP assistance in Florida is the\u00a0ACCESS Florida web page. Other assistance is available As well as Disaster-SNAP, existing food stamp recipients can avail themselves of certain other enhanced benefits in light of the damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Irma. According to the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, which oversees SNAP, regular Florida recipients can (as of 12 September 2017) temporarily use EBT cards to buy hot food (something they cannot normally do) and should have received their monthly allotment earlier than usual in September: USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) recently approved a temporary waiver and supported other actions that will help households participating in the USDA\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in Florida, Georgia, and the Virgin Islands, and the Nutrition Assistance Program in Puerto Rico, to access food in the wake of Hurricane Irma, including: In addition to these modifications, several types of federally-provided assistance are available to those affected by disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, both in Florida and in other states. These benefits include monetary assistance with rent and home repairs as well as funeral and medical care costs, as well as direct assistance such as FEMA\u2019s entering into lease agreements with owners of multi-family rental properties and performing repairs, with the aim of providing temporary accommodation for individuals. Variations in eligibility, rates of payment, duration of assistance, and type of assistance mean that it\u2019s virtually impossible to say how much an individual household or person might receive. Residents of states that have been affected by hurricanes and other disasters can check whether they are eligible for federal assistance, and apply for such assistance, by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov. The claim asserted in one of the Facebook rumors, that FEMA is offering individuals $500 via direct deposit to be used for purchasing food, has a grain of truth to it. As part of the assistance that the federal government provides to individuals and households in state where major disasters have been declared (as was the case in Florida), individuals who have lost their homes or been displaced can apply for what\u2019s known as Critical Needs Assistance, which consists of a one-time payment of $500, as explained by FEMA: FEMA may provide financial assistance to individuals and households who, as a result of the disaster, have immediate or critical needs because they are displaced from their primary dwelling. Immediate or critical needs are life-saving and life-sustaining items including, but not limited to: water, food, first aid, prescriptions, infant formula, diapers, consumable medical supplies, durable medical equipment, personal hygiene items, and fuel for transportation \u2026 It is a one-time $500 payment per household. However, the state must first ask FEMA to authorize Critical Needs Assistance in specific counties particularly badly hit by a disaster, FEMA must then grant that authorization, and the individual must go through an application process.

Anti-inflammatories should be used to fight Covid-19. Anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen may be useful in treating Covid-19 symptoms at home. Anticoagulants should be used to fight Covid-19.

{"claim_id":9083,"hypothesis":"Text messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit","date_published":"October 6, 2017","explanation_1":"Editor\u2019s note: On the day this\u00a0 review was published, the news release it\u2019s based on was removed from the EurekAlert! site. We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke. Figuring out ways to persuade them to stop has merit.","fact_checkers":"Sharon Dunwoody, PhD,Karen Carlson, MD,Kathlyn Stone","premise":"It is not made clear what costs would accompany this kind of mobile health message strategy, and whether the costs would be absorbed by health plans and health care providers that use the service, or by individual patients.

{"claim_id":9555,"hypothesis":"Botox Works As Well As Nerve Stimulator for Incontinence - Study","date_published":"October 10, 2016","explanation_1":"This news story\u00a0covers\u00a0a clinical trial that compared two different treatments for severe urinary urge incontinence in women. One treatment, which is more standard, is an electrical stimulator that calms nerves. The other and less well-understood treatment is shots of Botox (also known by its scientific name, onabotulinumtoxinA) to the same nerves. The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence. However, the story missed some of the nuances about the study\u2019s findings\u00a0(such as the\u00a0researchers\u2019 conclusions that\u00a0the results are of \u201cuncertain clinical importance\u201d). It also attempts to discuss cost, but provides no prices, and doesn\u2019t go far enough in detailing the potential harms of either treatment. And, because\u00a0the story\u2019s only interviewed\u00a0source has\u00a0potential conflicts of interest,\u00a0independent scrutiny was needed. Urinary incontinence is common, affecting millions of individuals, both women and men. The prevalence increases with age, but it is not a normal result of aging. The condition is more prevalent in women, though beyond the age of 80, both men and women reportedly have similar rates. The kind of incontinence studied here\u2013\u201csevere refractory urge incontinence\u201d\u2013specifically means a person has an abnormally frequent urge to urinate, and it is\u00a0resistant to standard treatments.","fact_checkers":"Dave Mosher,Ranit Mishori, MD, MHS, FAAFP,Joy Victory","premise":"We hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day. This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life. The closing line of the study brings this into question, i.e. how the work is of \u201cuncertain clinical importance,\u201d and good interview questions with both a study author and independent expert source could have greatly clarified the issue. Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com. And what of the harms of a neurostimulator implant? There\u2019s no mention of this, and the side effects are numerous. The story does a decent job of explaining that the study, stating it was \u201ca head to head comparison of a single Botox injection to the implanted medical device, assigning 381 women to randomly get one or the other treatment. The women were asked to keep diaries for six months.\u201d We\u2019re also told that the women had to have about 6 accidents over three days to be included in the study, and that other more standard treatments didn\u2019t help. The headline is also accurate, in terms of what the study found, and it doesn\u2019t overplay the results. In looking at the study, however, we\u2019ll note how we were struck by two things. First, the patients\u2019 reported impression of improvement in bladder leakage and function failed to pass a test of statistical significance, which undermines the story\u2019s claim that \u201cboth groups of women reported equal satisfaction.\u201d Second, the closing lines of the study point out how the treatment \u201cresulted in a small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain clinical importance.\u201d\u00a0This should have been explained to readers, along with details on what this means when researchers draw this conclusion. We don\u2019t see any language that would unnecessarily frighten a reader. The condition is real, uncomfortable, and carries\u00a0significant impact on people\u2019s daily lives. We didn\u2019t see\u00a0any backstopping of this study by an outside source. Although nonprofit websites are quoted, that material is used for purposes of background \u2014 not to assess the study\u2019s claims. Another significant oversight here is no mention of co-authors\u2019 financial relationships with the products used in both arms of the trial. (We give props to a Duke University press release about the study for pointing this out.) A quick Google search of the lead author\u2019s name and the term Medtronic reveals that she has been a consultant for the neurostimulator devicemaker, as well as for Allergan, Botox\u2019s manufacturer. We not only see a comparison to the medical device that the study focused on, but also methods that require no overt treatment, \u201csuch as weight loss, drinking less caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding lifting heavy objects.\u201d The story also notes that \u201c[e]xercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can help, as can \u2018bladder training\u2019 to accustom the body to urinating at regular times.\u201d The story could have been more clear that these treatments aren\u2019t likely to work for the women in this study who had a specific type of severe urge incontinence that is usually not responsive to exercise and other less invasive measures. Both of these treatments are widely available. But,\u00a0a description of the procedures themselves would have been helpful (they are both quite invasive and require seeing providers with special training). While \u2018regular\u2019 Botox cosmetic treatments can be easily given by various medical professionals, without specialized training, in the office, this may not be the case for Botox injections into the bladder. The story didn\u2019t establish what\u2019s novel about this study. As the news release states, the study was \u201cthe first randomized trial comparing the efficacy of two FDA-approved, third-line therapies in a severely affected population.\u201d We didn\u2019t catch any overtly copy\/pasted quotes or language that made its way into the story from the\u00a0Duke University news release.","sources":" ","label":3,"subjects":"Botox,urinary incontinence","__index_level_0__":9684,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nWe hear a lot about costs throughout this story, but see no specific numbers or meaningful discussion. And this is a major oversight, since\u2014at least according to a 2015 study that focused on the UK National Health Service\u2014Botox combined with quality supportive care \u201cappears to be a cost-effective use of resources.\u201d A neurostimulator for bladder issues costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Meanwhile, one unit (or \u201cU\u201d) of Botox costs roughly\u00a0$10-$28, with a typical cost hovering between $10-$12 per U. Since the treatment uses 200 U of Botox, its price is likely about $2,000-$2,500 per 6-month treatment course, but that doesn\u2019t include the cost of administering it, which is likely to be considerable. The benefits are stated as such: The Botox injections freed 20 percent of the women in the study of incontinence, compared to 4 percent who had a nerve stimulator implant, Amundesen and colleagues reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cForty-six percent in the onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) group and 26 percent in the sacral neuromodulation group had at least a 75 percent reduction in the number of episodes of urgency incontinence,\u201d they added. and On average, both treatments cut the number of \u201caccidents\u201d \u2013 Botox by almost four times a day and the nerve stimulator by about three times a day. This is sufficient for a Satisfactory rating on this criterion. We would have liked to have seen more discussion about actual improvements (perceived and otherwise) to patient quality of life. The closing line of the study brings this into question, i.e. how the work is of \u201cuncertain clinical importance,\u201d and good interview questions with both a study author and independent expert source could have greatly clarified the issue. Urinary tract infections were three times more common in the women who received Botox shots, and the reader is informed of this. But a lot is left out. We would have also liked to see noted other side effects of Botox for urinary incontinence, such as blood in the urine, fatigue, insomnia, and\u00a0inability to completely empty the bladder (in about 17% of people) \u2014 and the need to self-catheterize to relieve the problem. And then there are the more general side effects left out of the story, including \u201cdry mouth, discomfort or pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, neck pain, and eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight, drooping eyelids, swelling of your eyelids, and dry eyes,\u201d according to botoxforincontinence.com. And what of the harms of a neurostimulator implant? There\u2019s no mention of this, and the side effects are numerous. The story does a decent job of explaining that the study, stating it was \u201ca head to head comparison of a single Botox injection to the implanted medical device, assigning 381 women to randomly get one or the other treatment. The women were asked to keep diaries for six months.\u201d We\u2019re also told that the women had to have about 6 accidents over three days to be included in the study, and that other more standard treatments didn\u2019t help. The headline is also accurate, in terms of what the study found, and it doesn\u2019t overplay the results. In looking at the study, however, we\u2019ll note how we were struck by two things. First, the patients\u2019 reported impression of improvement in bladder leakage and function failed to pass a test of statistical significance, which undermines the story\u2019s claim that \u201cboth groups of women reported equal satisfaction.\u201d Second, the closing lines of the study point out how the treatment \u201cresulted in a small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain clinical importance.\u201d\u00a0This should have been explained to readers, along with details on what this means when researchers draw this conclusion. We don\u2019t see any language that would unnecessarily frighten a reader. The condition is real, uncomfortable, and carries\u00a0significant impact on people\u2019s daily lives. We didn\u2019t see\u00a0any backstopping of this study by an outside source. Although nonprofit websites are quoted, that material is used for purposes of background \u2014 not to assess the study\u2019s claims. Another significant oversight here is no mention of co-authors\u2019 financial relationships with the products used in both arms of the trial. (We give props to a Duke University press release about the study for pointing this out.) A quick Google search of the lead author\u2019s name and the term Medtronic reveals that she has been a consultant for the neurostimulator devicemaker, as well as for Allergan, Botox\u2019s manufacturer. We not only see a comparison to the medical device that the study focused on, but also methods that require no overt treatment, \u201csuch as weight loss, drinking less caffeine and alcohol, and avoiding lifting heavy objects.\u201d The story also notes that \u201c[e]xercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles can help, as can \u2018bladder training\u2019 to accustom the body to urinating at regular times.\u201d The story could have been more clear that these treatments aren\u2019t likely to work for the women in this study who had a specific type of severe urge incontinence that is usually not responsive to exercise and other less invasive measures. Both of these treatments are widely available. But,\u00a0a description of the procedures themselves would have been helpful (they are both quite invasive and require seeing providers with special training). While \u2018regular\u2019 Botox cosmetic treatments can be easily given by various medical professionals, without specialized training, in the office, this may not be the case for Botox injections into the bladder. The story didn\u2019t establish what\u2019s novel about this study.

The study indicates that Botox and the nerve stimulator both reduced the number of 'accidents' significantly, suggesting effectiveness in treating incontinence. However, the Botox treatment resulted in urinary tract infections being three times more common compared to the nerve stimulator, indicating a difference in side effect profiles which affects the overall assessment of 'working as well.' Additionally, the study highlighted that while there was a reduction in the number of incontinence episodes, this was of 'uncertain clinical importance,' questioning the significance of the improvement. Hence, while both treatments were effective to some extent, their equivalency in efficacy and safety is not conclusively supported, making the claim only partially true."}

We searched that particular issue, and Trump appeared on the November 9, 1992 cover under the text: \u201cFighting Back, Trump Scrambles Off the Canvas.\u201dOn page 41 of the issue, what appears to be a paraphrase by author Julie Baumgold appeared:The final paragraph above appeared to be the author\u2019s paraphrasing of Trump\u2019s sentiments\u00a0toward women he perceived as seeking attention (even negative attention) from powerful men:[Trump\u2019s] contempt for beautiful women who like to be abused is boundless, and he is full of stories of supermodels, women he might call twelves (not their size), clinging to a rockstar\u2019s legs and the rock star kicking them away. You have to treat them like s\u2014. He\u2019s seen the disloyalty of wives and widows; a \u201cdisloyal lady\u201d like Barbara Walters, who asked him about his divorce on TV when she promised she wouldn\u2019t; and major babes who fall for guys with voices and guitars. He\u2019s a \u201cguarded guy.\u201d Babes are bad \u2026[page 42, continued] \u2026 but necessary. [Quotation.] Women are two types for him \u2014 those of use, and those he beds, or \u201csacks,\u201d and, of the two, the former probably get more of his heart.That excerpt featured the author\u2019s\u00a0characterization\u00a0of Trump in the profile, based on the writer\u2019s personal observations. In that appearance, the quote is part of a pastiche of commentary made by Trump himself and descriptors appended by that journalist, such as the \u201ctwo types of women\u201d commentary.However, the quote appears a second time on page 43 of the same issue, that time in a different context. Philip Johnson, the individual referenced, is a noted architect\u00a0who worked on Trump\u2019s casino around the period the article was published:In the screenshot above, the second appearance of the quotation appears in the second complete paragraph on the left. It appears to represent half of a conversation, the other half to which readers were not privy. It begins with a setting (the \u201cearly-morning hours\u201d and a \u201ccasino floor\u201d), and the relevant part begins:Philip Johnson looks at his watch. He is going to Berlin this evening to design a building at Checkpoint Charlie. Trump is talking about women and says \u201cYou have to treat \u2019em like s\u2014.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d make a good mafioso,\u201d says Johnson.\u201cOne of the greatest,\u201d says Donald as the car glides through the protected pinelands into the corrupted city.Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson. Tyson told Trump the woman who put him in jail \u201cwanted it real bad.\u201d Trump feels Tyson is doing time on a bad rap: \u201cShe knocked on his door at 1 AM and was up and dancing at eight the next morning.\u201d This speech is another of the set pieces he is so fond of delivering. When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and community service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice to him for the first time in his 46 years.Based on the format of the article, which jumped around and featured quotes without preceding context, Donald Trump may have been more broadly voicing his negative opinion of a woman who accused boxer Mike Tyson of rape in the early 1990s. Tyson was convicted and jailed in February 1992; the boxer was imprisoned when the Trump profile ran in November of that year.From the context, it was difficult to discern whether Trump\u2019s \u201cyou\u00a0have to treat \u2019em like shit\u201d comment was spoken outside the context of Tyson, as part of his distaste for the decision to convict his friend, or in some other context not provided.However, the citation on page 41 provided the quote in paraphrase form, in a broader characterization of Trump\u2019s commentary\u00a0about powerful men and the bad behavior women \u201callowed\u201d them to indulge in. Additionally confusing was that a nearly exact version of the phrase was presented as a direct quote attributed to Trump two pages later. In that portion, the writer claims Trump was \u201ctalking about women\u201d and said \u201cyou have to treat \u2019em like [shit. ]\u201dTrump denied making the remarks in any context in a 2016\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0interview:[Interviewer]: Let\u2019s talk about women. Your feelings toward them seem conflicted, even chauvinistic, confusing since you adore and respect your mother so much. [Trump]: I have great relationships with women, my mother, Ivana, Marla, my female executives are better than the men: tougher, smarter. [Interviewer]: So why in 1992 did you tell a writer for New York magazine, Marie Brenner, that \u2018You have to treat women like shit\u201d \u2014 ultimately pouring a bottle of wine down her back? [Trump]: I didn\u2019t say that. The woman\u2019s a liar, extremely unattractive, lots of problems because of her looks. [Interviewer]: That statement is exactly why women think you\u2019re a chauvinist pig. [Trump]: They\u2019re right \u2014 and not. People say, \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d but there\u2019s a truth in it, in a modified form. Psychologists will tell you that some women want to be treated with respect, others differently. I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, \u201cBe rougher and you\u2019ll see a different relationship.\u2019 Unfortunately, with people in general, you get more with vinegar than honey.That interview mentions Marie Brenner, a\u00a0Vanity Fair writer who profiled Trump in 1991; Brenner accused Trump of pouring wine on her because he was displeased about something she\u2019d written. The interview appeared to conflate Brenner, upon whom Trump had purportedly poured wine, and Baumgold, author of the 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.Confusion may have also stemmed from what appeared to be the first post-candidacy appearance of the claim via The Daily Beast in 2015, which mentioned both the wine claim as well as the quote from a conversation with Johnson. In March 2016, the quote in it\u2019s \u201cwomen, you have to \u2026\u201d form appeared in an attack ad.According to Baumgold, Trump was talking about women when he made the remarks, but their complete context did not appear in the piece. \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d presented a modified version of the quote, attributing the phrase to Trump as such: \u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d Although Baumgold broadly reported Trump was speaking about women when he said \u201cyou have to treat them like [shit],\u201d the complete context of the quote was missing.","sources":"https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/is-this-the-newest-and-clearest-photo-of-pluto\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Did+Donald+Trump+Say+%27Women%2C+You+Have+to+Treat+Them+Like+S---%27+in+a+1992+Interview%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA41&vq=%22babes%20are%20bad%22&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q=%22you%20have%20to%20treat%20them%20like%20s%22&f=false, https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/vb8pq3\/women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit-new-ad-highlights-trumps-statements-on-women, https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/you-have-to-treat-em-like-shit-before-megyn-kelly-trump-dumped-wine-on-a-female-reporter, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/news\/donald-trump-women-unearthed-1994-primetime-interview-nancy-collins-938176, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OccupyDemocrats\/posts\/3042002795892754, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdid-donald-trump-say-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-s-in-a-1992-interview%2F, https:\/\/archive.fo\/BeEY2, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/boxing-legend-convicted-of-raping-beauty-queen, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-upper-case-and-lower-case-originally-refer-to-where-printers-kept-their-letters\/, https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BeUCAAAAMBAJ&q=%22babes+are+bad%22#v=onepage&q=mafioso&f=false, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/tag\/occupy-democrats\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/disinformation\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/did-an-arkansas-republican-propose-cutting-free-lunches-to-punish-students\/, https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/frontline\/interview\/marie-brenner\/, https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/dept-of-design\/philip-johnson-the-man-who-made-architecture-amoral, https:\/\/hoax-alert.leadstories.com\/3470895-fake-news-donald-trump-women-you-have-to-treat-them-like-shit.html","label":3,"subjects":"Disinformation, Fact Checks","__index_level_0__":4178,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn September 14 2019 the popular \u2014 but not always accurate \u2014 Facebook page \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d shared a Donald Trump quote meme\u00a0(archived here), alleging that the President said \u201cwomen, you have to treat them like shit\u201d in a 1992\u00a0New York Magazine profile.To the right of an image of President Trump, text stated:\u201cWomen, you have to treat them like shit.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump, 1992,\u00a0New York MagazineThis is an ACTUAL Trump quote, AND THE PART OF \u201cFAMILY VALUES\u201d COULDN\u2019T CARE LESS!The meme\u2019s claim was presented in the second part of the text, that \u201cyou have to treat [women] like shit\u201d was an \u201cactual Trump quote.\u201d The group helpfully provided a specific citation window, namely a 1992 article in\u00a0New York Magazine.As our friends at Lead Stories pointed out,\u00a0New York Magazine\u2018s archives from 1992 were searchable on Google Books. We searched that particular issue, and Trump appeared on the November 9, 1992 cover under the text: \u201cFighting Back, Trump Scrambles Off the Canvas.\u201dOn page 41 of the issue, what appears to be a paraphrase by author Julie Baumgold appeared:The final paragraph above appeared to be the author\u2019s paraphrasing of Trump\u2019s sentiments\u00a0toward women he perceived as seeking attention (even negative attention) from powerful men:[Trump\u2019s] contempt for beautiful women who like to be abused is boundless, and he is full of stories of supermodels, women he might call twelves (not their size), clinging to a rockstar\u2019s legs and the rock star kicking them away. You have to treat them like s\u2014. He\u2019s seen the disloyalty of wives and widows; a \u201cdisloyal lady\u201d like Barbara Walters, who asked him about his divorce on TV when she promised she wouldn\u2019t; and major babes who fall for guys with voices and guitars. He\u2019s a \u201cguarded guy.\u201d Babes are bad \u2026[page 42, continued] \u2026 but necessary. [Quotation.] Women are two types for him \u2014 those of use, and those he beds, or \u201csacks,\u201d and, of the two, the former probably get more of his heart.That excerpt featured the author\u2019s\u00a0characterization\u00a0of Trump in the profile, based on the writer\u2019s personal observations. In that appearance, the quote is part of a pastiche of commentary made by Trump himself and descriptors appended by that journalist, such as the \u201ctwo types of women\u201d commentary.However, the quote appears a second time on page 43 of the same issue, that time in a different context. Philip Johnson, the individual referenced, is a noted architect\u00a0who worked on Trump\u2019s casino around the period the article was published:In the screenshot above, the second appearance of the quotation appears in the second complete paragraph on the left. It appears to represent half of a conversation, the other half to which readers were not privy. It begins with a setting (the \u201cearly-morning hours\u201d and a \u201ccasino floor\u201d), and the relevant part begins:Philip Johnson looks at his watch. He is going to Berlin this evening to design a building at Checkpoint Charlie. Trump is talking about women and says \u201cYou have to treat \u2019em like s\u2014.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d make a good mafioso,\u201d says Johnson.\u201cOne of the greatest,\u201d says Donald as the car glides through the protected pinelands into the corrupted city.Donald is discussing his buddy Mike Tyson. Tyson told Trump the woman who put him in jail \u201cwanted it real bad.\u201d Trump feels Tyson is doing time on a bad rap: \u201cShe knocked on his door at 1 AM and was up and dancing at eight the next morning.\u201d This speech is another of the set pieces he is so fond of delivering. When he defended Tyson and suggested a payoff and community service for the champ, his mother got so angry she raised her voice to him for the first time in his 46 years.Based on the format of the article, which jumped around and featured quotes without preceding context, Donald Trump may have been more broadly voicing his negative opinion of a woman who accused boxer Mike Tyson of rape in the early 1990s. Tyson was convicted and jailed in February 1992; the boxer was imprisoned when the Trump profile ran in November of that year.From the context, it was difficult to discern whether Trump\u2019s \u201cyou\u00a0have to treat \u2019em like shit\u201d comment was spoken outside the context of Tyson, as part of his distaste for the decision to convict his friend, or in some other context not provided.However, the citation on page 41 provided the quote in paraphrase form, in a broader characterization of Trump\u2019s commentary\u00a0about powerful men and the bad behavior women \u201callowed\u201d them to indulge in. Additionally confusing was that a nearly exact version of the phrase was presented as a direct quote attributed to Trump two pages later. In that portion, the writer claims Trump was \u201ctalking about women\u201d and said \u201cyou have to treat \u2019em like [shit. ]\u201dTrump denied making the remarks in any context in a 2016\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0interview:[Interviewer]: Let\u2019s talk about women. Your feelings toward them seem conflicted, even chauvinistic, confusing since you adore and respect your mother so much. [Trump]: I have great relationships with women, my mother, Ivana, Marla, my female executives are better than the men: tougher, smarter. [Interviewer]: So why in 1992 did you tell a writer for New York magazine, Marie Brenner, that \u2018You have to treat women like shit\u201d \u2014 ultimately pouring a bottle of wine down her back? [Trump]: I didn\u2019t say that. The woman\u2019s a liar, extremely unattractive, lots of problems because of her looks. [Interviewer]: That statement is exactly why women think you\u2019re a chauvinist pig. [Trump]: They\u2019re right \u2014 and not. People say, \u201cHow can you say such a thing?\u201d but there\u2019s a truth in it, in a modified form. Psychologists will tell you that some women want to be treated with respect, others differently. I tell friends who treat their wives magnificently, get treated like crap in return, \u201cBe rougher and you\u2019ll see a different relationship.\u2019 Unfortunately, with people in general, you get more with vinegar than honey.That interview mentions Marie Brenner, a\u00a0Vanity Fair writer who profiled Trump in 1991; Brenner accused Trump of pouring wine on her because he was displeased about something she\u2019d written.

Additionally, Trump's comments were part of a larger conversation about a specific case involving Mike Tyson, rather than a general statement about all women. Furthermore, Trump has denied making the statement in the manner it has been presented. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified as true or false without considering the nuances and context in which the statement appeared."}
