{"claim_id":14191,"hypothesis":"Hillary Clinton Says Donald Trump promised to repeal Obamacare, build a wall, ban Muslims, and more.","date_published":"May 5, 2016","explanation_1":"A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five\u00a0of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn\u2019t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate.","fact_checkers":"Jon Greenberg","premise":"\"Even before Donald Trump\u2019s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, \"\"Everything I say I\u2019m going to do folks, I do.\"\" It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We\u2019ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren\u2019t actually promises. We did not hear back. \u2018Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day\u2019 At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. \"\"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases,\"\" Trump said. \"\"My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\"\" The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, \"\"I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools.\"\" Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. \u2018Defund Planned Parenthood\u2019 Trump\u2019s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, \"\"Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,\"\" and then continued \"\"but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood.\"\" Trump\u2019s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. \u2018Repeal Obamacare\u2019 There doesn\u2019t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says \"\"On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\"\" \u2018Build a great great wall\u2019 Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn\u2019t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish \u2018a deportation force\u2019 There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said \"\"You\u2019re going to have a deportation force. And you\u2019re going to do it humanely.\"\" We couldn\u2019t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn\u2019t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, \"\"Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.\"\" Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, \"\"We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out.\"\" Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn\u2019t said if he would create a new deportation unit. While he might not be touting the same phrase, the result remains the same. \u2018Ban Muslims from entering the country\u2019 Immediately after the shootings by Muslim fundamentalists in San Bernardino in December 2015, the Trump campaign\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0saying, \"\"Donald Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\"\" Within a few days, Trump said\u00a0certain people would be exempted, including American citizens who are Muslim, foreign leaders, and athletes headed to competitions. However, according to the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0within his first 100 days \"\"the immigration ban on Muslims would be in place.\"\" That puts the ban firmly in the promise zone. \u2018Kill the spouses and children of our enemies\u2019 Trump said this during an interview on Fox and Friends, Dec. 2, 2015. \"\"The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,\"\" Trump said. In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump seemed to dial down this threat. O\u2019Reilly asked him if he would have killed members of the bin Laden family. Trump said \"\"I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer.\"\" Trump was pressed on this at the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. Asked how this policy would set the United States apart from ISIS, Trump said, \"\"We have to be much tougher.\"\" Trump finished his answer with, \"\"I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families\u2019 lives.\"\" While this could be a death threat, it isn\u2019t quite as clear as his original statement. Clearly, he wants to make family members suffer, but he doesn\u2019t say how much. Restore waterboarding and \u2018go further\u2019 In the Republican debate right before the New Hampshire primary, Trump said, \"\"I would bring back waterboarding and I\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\"\" Trump stood by his waterboarding policy on March 22, 2016, telling CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer he would \"\"go further.\"\" Trump has also said that \"\"torture works.\"\" The only caveat that Trump offered during his CNN interview is that he would listen to military officials\u2019 advice on the use of interrogation methods. Whether a Trump administration would ever use waterboarding, he has promised to keep it on the table. Our ruling A Clinton campaign video listed eight steps Trump has promised to take as president. Five\u00a0of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn\u2019t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them. The video might miss a couple of nuances, but it is generally accurate.","sources":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/02\/07\/us\/politics\/transcript-of-the-republican-presidential-debate-in-new-hampshire.html, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/trump-says-torture-works-backs-waterboarding-and-much-worse\/2016\/02\/17\/4c9277be-d59c-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html, https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/12\/02\/politics\/donald-trump-terrorists-families\/, https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/05\/05\/us\/politics\/donald-trump-president.html, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/post-politics\/wp\/2015\/12\/08\/donald-trump-explains-how-his-ban-on-muslims-entering-the-u-s-would-work\/, http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/624\/cpsprodpb\/E11D\/production\/_87092675_000001atrump.jpg, https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/10\/28\/donald-trump-mexico-going-to-pay-for-wall.html, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/the-fix\/wp\/2016\/02\/25\/the-cnntelemundo-republican-debate-transcript-annotated\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/HillaryClinton\/status\/727582702749159424, http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/video\/2015\/11\/11\/donald-trump-we-will-have-a-deportation-force\/, https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2016\/05\/04\/a-simple-guide-to-what-donald-trump-wants-to-do-to-america\/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_wonkblog-america1235p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory, https:\/\/twitter.com\/realdonaldtrump\/status\/683277309969694720, https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/positions\/healthcare-reform, https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2016\/may\/01\/ted-cruz\/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-planned-parenthood\/, https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/statements\/2015\/dec\/17\/rand-paul\/rand-pauls-right-geneva-conventions-bar-donald-tru\/","label":0,"subjects":"Abortion, Immigration, National, Health Care, Human Rights, Islam, Foreign Policy, Religion, Terrorism, Guns, Hillary Clinton, ","__index_level_0__":2425,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"Even before Donald Trump\u2019s Republican rivals bowed out, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted a video warning about a potential Trump presidency. The video opens with a clip of Trump at an event saying, \"\"Everything I say I\u2019m going to do folks, I do.\"\" It then lists eight steps Trump has said he will take. As the text of each one appears on the screen, audio of Trump plays in the background. We\u2019ll go through in order and assess whether Trump really has made each promise. We asked the Trump campaign if any of these promises were misstated, or if they weren\u2019t actually promises. We did not hear back. \u2018Get rid of gun-free zones on schools on his first day\u2019 At a campaign event in Burlington, Vt., on Jan. 7, 2016, Trump said that the number of victims in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris would have been much lower if the people in those places had been armed. He lamented the deaths of five soldiers in a shooting rampage in Chattanooga, Tenn. \"\"I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases,\"\" Trump said. \"\"My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.\"\" The Clinton campaign also cited an interview with Trump on the Outdoor Channel Jan. 21, 2016, in which he said, \"\"I'm going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases. I'm also going to do it in schools.\"\" Trump has said little recently about gun-free zones, but the issue resurfaced when a petition emerged that would allow delegates to the Republican National Convention to carry guns. On March 28, 2016, ABC reporter Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would support that. Trump said he would consider the petition, but the Secret Service ruled out allowing guns at the conventions as a security risk. \u2018Defund Planned Parenthood\u2019 Trump\u2019s stance on funding Planned Parenthood has shifted somewhat over time. In August 2015, he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that it would be worth shutting down the government to cut off tax dollars going to Planned Parenthood. But he has also praised the organization for providing regular care to women of limited means. In March, Trump said, \"\"Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,\"\" and then continued \"\"but we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood.\"\" Trump\u2019s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood so long as the organization continues to perform abortions. \u2018Repeal Obamacare\u2019 There doesn\u2019t seem to be any ambiguity on this one. On his campaign website, Trump says \"\"On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\"\" \u2018Build a great great wall\u2019 Trump has made building a wall along the border with Mexico his signature initiative, and he hasn\u2019t wavered. He has said it many times. In the course of interviews with the New York Times published May 4, 2016, he said within his first 100 days the wall would be designed, and there would be bilateral talks with Mexico, presumably on how they would pay for it -- another promise Trump has made. Establish \u2018a deportation force\u2019 There is no question that Trump called for teams to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The term itself goes back to an interview Trump gave on MSNBC in November 2015 when he said \"\"You\u2019re going to have a deportation force. And you\u2019re going to do it humanely.\"\" We couldn\u2019t find Trump promoting this again, although in the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican debate, he didn\u2019t back away from the phrase. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer teed up a question saying, \"\"Mr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States.\"\" Trump prefaced his answer with a cut at his rivals for supporting amnesty and then said, \"\"We either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out.\"\" Trump has definitely committed to expanding the number of immigration and border control agents and to removing 11 million people. He hasn\u2019t said if he would create a new deportation unit.

According to the report, more than 9,000 children age 12 and younger died in a car crash from 2002 to 2011. \u201cThe good news is motor vehicle deaths decreased by 43 percent over the past decade for children age 12 and younger. The tragic news is still with that decrease, more than 9,000 kids were killed on the road in this period,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference. \u201cThousands of children are at risk on the road because they are not buckled up,\u201d he said. The study found that of the children who died between 2009 to 2010, a much higher proportion of black and Hispanic children were not buckled, compared with white kids. \u201cThe difference was nearly half (45 percent for blacks and 46 percent for Hispanics) versus a quarter (26 percent) for white kids,\u201d Frieden said. The study did not investigate why racial differences played such a big role in seat belt use, but it did suggest socio-economic factors may play a role. For the study, CDC researchers analyzed data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find the number of deaths among occupants in cars from 2002 to 2011 for all children aged up to the age of 12. Overall, 9,182 children died in car crashes during the period. But deaths dropped sharply, from 2.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002, to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2011, a 43 percent decline. According to the report, seat belt use increased from 88 percent in 2002 to 91 percent in 2011 among all children age 7 and under. The study also confirmed earlier findings that older children are less likely to be wearing seat belts than younger children. To prevent future deaths from car crashes, Frieden said parents should make sure their children use appropriate-sized car seats, booster seats and seat belts on every trip.

It did not specify which ones or when, saying this would depend on data continuing to show a slowdown in the spread of the new coronavirus. \u201cWe have to start reviving the economy while keeping the pandemic under control,\u201d said Prime Minister Antonio Costa shortly before parliament approved the third extension of the lockdown, now in place until May 2. Initially declared by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on March 18, the national lockdown restricted the movement of people and led thousands of businesses to suspend activities, especially in the restaurant and hotel sector. Costa said remote working should continue in the next month to contain the spread of the disease but said public services should be \u201cre-established\u201d and that he hoped childcare centres could reopen. Costa also said the government had approved plans to ensure masks and hand gel were available en masse in the coming fortnight. \u201cIt is fundamental to give the Portuguese the confidence to leave their homes and for this we must make means of protection abundant,\u201d he said. The municipality of Portimao in southern Portugal and the Madeira Islands said they would distribute 250,000 masks to their populations from next week, after health authorities reported on Monday they were considering making the use of masks obligatory in closed public spaces. Health Secretary Antonio Sales said on Wednesday Portugal\u2019s coronavirus curve had flattened due to the \u201cexcellent behaviour and civic-mindedness of the Portuguese people\u201d who obeyed the lockdown rules imposed by the government. The coronavirus outbreak has hit various sectors of the tourism-dependent, export-oriented economy.

{"claim_id":36157,"hypothesis":"An image shows a man's mostly-consumed Red Bull energy drink, after he found a dead mouse in the container.","date_published":"September 24, 2019","explanation_1":"Did a Man Find a Dead Mouse in a Nearly Empty Red Bull Can?","fact_checkers":"  Kim LaCapria  ","premise":"On September 5 2019, Facebook user Seth Bowman shared the following post (archived here), alongside a claim his Red Bull energy drink was contaminated by a dead mouse. According to Bowman\u2019s claim, he had nearly finished drinking the can of Red Bull when \u201cchunks\u201d alerted him to the presence of the former rodent:So I drank a whole Red Bull the other night at work and found this at the bottom. I\u2019ve tried contacting Red Bull and haven\u2019t heard a word back. So do me a favor and let\u2019s make this viral.Bowman requested that predictably disgusted Facebook users do him \u201ca favor\u201d and \u201cmake this viral\u201d; they did,\u00a0 sharing the post over 150,000 times. We did not see users sharing the post to Red Bull\u2019s social media accounts, nor did we find any public acknowledgement of Bowman\u2019s claim. A friend of the poster shared the claim to Reddit\u2019s r\/WTF, where readers were skeptical.Bowman was certainly not the first person to claim they found a dead rodent in a soft drink or energy drink. In a 1988 newspaper column, folklorist\u00a0Jan Harold Brunvand examined claims that at the time spread without Facebook or email, indicating they appeared to be as old as bottled soft drinks themselves, and instances of ostension \u2014 when people took the claim to real life.Brunvand explained how the stories existed on two levels \u2014 one being the claims as they appeared as early as 1914, and another being representative of our fears involving handing off the responsibility for food safety from our homes to faceless corporations:A search of published appeals-court records conducted in 1976 turned up 45 such cases against soda bottlers, the first in 1914. And one can only guess how many similar cases were never appealed or were settled out of court.Most of the people who tell the mouse-in-Coke legend don\u2019t know the legal history, though. What they do know is a good story, whether it\u2019s told by a friend, a neighbor or co-worker. The tellers assume that somewhere, sometime, an actual lawsuit was brought against a soft-drink bottling company.So while the lawsuits are real, the stories are not, because they are so far separated from the original facts that they\u2019ve turned into folklore. In this way, a story can be both an actual event and a legend. And the mouse-in-Coke legends, like most urban legends, have lives of their own completely separate from the facts.What has occurred, I believe, is something like this: The theme of foreign matter contaminating food is a popular one in urban legends. And \u201cCoke\u201d has become virtually a generic way to refer to soft drinks. So the legends get started and gain credibility from lawsuits that people vaguely remember, in which mice were said to be found in soda bottles. And naturally, it is usually Coke that is mentioned in the legend whether or not the original suits were against Coke.As the legend spreads by word of mouth, the trauma is exaggerated, the drama heightened. And the size of the settlement, of course, grows and grows. The end result: The indignation against the giant corporation that is selling contaminated food is pumped up to a full measure of outrage.In 2016, The Verge published a \u201cbrief history\u201d of viral claims about dead mice or rats in sodas and energy drinks. Following yet another claim involving a deceased rodent and Dr. Pepper, the news organization examined several such claims, many of which appeared in 2012.The article referenced a notable 2012 lawsuit against PepsiCo, brought by a man who alleged he found a dead mouse in a can of Mountain Dew:Ronald Ball, 52, from Madison County, Ill., claims he tasted something foul in the can of drink he purchased from a vending machine at his work.According to his lawsuit, Ball claims he spat out the soda, the Madison County Record reported. He said he \u201ctook a drink, and immediately became violently ill such that he began to vomit \u2026\u00a0The contents of said can of Mountain Dew were immediately poured into a Styrofoam cup wherein a dead mouse was found,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.Ball sent the mouse to PepsiCo \u2014 along with a letter of complaint \u2014 but the oil company worker says the soda giant destroyed the body of the mouse, and therefore, his evidence.The incident happened in November 2009 and Ball [was] seeking $50,000 damages.Ball\u2019s suit led to a rather nauseating spate of articles about whether the composition of Mountain Dew would degrade or preserve the corpse of a small animal, with lawyers arguing that the beverage would rapidly dissolve a mouse\u2019s remains:Key to Pepsi\u2019s legal argument is that there\u2019s no chance a mouse\u2019s corpse could survive, intact, for 15 months swimming in Mountain Dew. While published studies have not been conducted on how rapidly Mountain Dew would dissolve a mouse, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the neon green soda can eat away teeth and bones in a matter of months, and would likely do quite a number on a rodent.\u201cI think it is plausible that it could dissolve a mouse in a few months,\u201d said Yan-Fang Ren of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, who has studied the effects of citric acid on bones and teeth. \u201cBut dissolving [the mouse] does not mean it will disappear, because you\u2019ll still have the collagen and the soft tissue part. It will be like rubber.\u201dA similar claim was reported in 2011, involving the Monster brand of energy drinks. Another brand of energy drink was at the center of similar claims in 2016, when a consumer was purportedly sickened by a dead mouse in a beverage can:[Jordan] Bell started dry heaving and went straight to a doctor, who advised he go to the hospital. At the Mission Hospital they contacted BC Poison Control and told Bell that in about 24 hours he would probably experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.And in March 2018, an Arkansas Red Bull drinker reported finding a rodent at the bottom of his can. His claim went viral on Facebook, but many users were skeptical of its legitimacy:While [claimant Josh] Henley said it was not possible the rodent got inside the can when he left it in the car overnight, many people on social media said it was the highest possibility.The video, which was shared [in March 2018], went viral and was viewed more than 100,000 times and counting. It was first shared by Henley on Facebook.Some social media users also raised doubts about the legitimacy of the video.Joshua Nightingale commented: \u201cYou drank it last night, most likely that mouse got in after you drank it and went to sleep. Wouldn\u2019t you have noticed it last night after or while you were drinking it?\u201d Another comment said: \u201cIt obviously went in after you drank it.\u201dIn a statement to Mirror Online, a spokesman for Red Bull said: \u201cIt is inconceivable that a particle \u2014 let alone anything like this \u2014 could pass through the process of world-class, modern beverage manufacture.\u201dIn April 2017, beverage corporation lawyers once again argued the claims were impossible, and that the specimen was not sufficiently decomposed:[The claimant was] suing Coca-Cola for a modest amount, having medical bills related to his illness that total around $1,000, and he missed 60 hours of work. He also says that he lost thirty pounds due to his illness.Coca-Cola, however, disputes that it\u2019s possible to find such an intact mouse in one of its beverage cans. In the time that it would take for a mouse to be sealed inside a can at a bottling plant, then for the can to be distributed to a retail store and purchased, the mouse would have decomposed enough to have \u201ccompromised the can,\u201d or given off gases that would make the can bulge or burst.An attorney from Minnesota who is on the team representing Coke explained to the Mitchell Republic that the company \u201ctakes these cases extremely seriously and tries them all,\u201d since allegations of mouse contamination are damaging to its brand. Settling for a modest amount would be cheaper and easier, but the company would rather defend itself at trial \u2026 The plaintiff is seeking $2,026 and general damages, plus interest.That coverage raised two interesting aspects about dead-mouse-in-soda-can claims: that beverage companies maintain that they always take such suits to trial, and tacitly that claims of this sort seem to be somewhat common. It also appears that beverage manufacturers often feel confident rodent-in-soda claims are unlikely to hold up in court. The outlet quoted above also linked to a similar legal claim, with findings that the creature was a \u201ctoad\u201d and that no mechanism for its presence was ever determined.In 2012, however, Ball\u2019s claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, and it was conditional in part on PepsiCo disclaiming responsibility. The 2009 case involving what appeared to be a toad yielded little useful information with respect to such contamination and how it might occur. At the time, a PepsiCo spokesman declined via email to speculate on how the toad got there:The FDA also conducted an investigation at the local Pepsi bottling plant in Orlando from August 4 to 11 [2009] and \u201cdid not find any adverse conditions or association to this problem,\u201d spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said.\u201cWe have not determined when or how the contamination occurred,\u201d DeLancey said in an e-mail.Pepsi says the FDA results \u201caffirmed\u201d the company\u2019s confidence \u201cin the quality of our products and the integrity of our manufacturing system,\u201d according to spokesman Jeff Dahncke.\u201cThe speed of our production lines and the rigor of our quality control systems make it virtually impossible for this type of thing to happen in a production environment. In fact, there never has been even a single instance when a claim of this nature has been traced back to a manufacturing issue \u2026\u00a0The FDA conducted a thorough inspection of our Orlando facility and found no cause for concern. In this case, the FDA simply was unable to determine when or how the specimen entered the package.\u201dWhen asked if Pepsi believed it was not responsible for the animal getting into the can, Dahncke said, \u201cWe have addressed the facts of the investigation and stated our position. It\u2019s not appropriate for us to comment beyond that.\u201dA September 2019 Facebook post claiming a user found a dead mouse in his can of Red Bull was virally popular, but neither unique in structure nor even as it pertained to Red Bull. Stories about dead rodents in bottled or canned soft drinks date back more than a century, and occasionally cross from the realm of folklore into the news by way of claims like the one to hand.

A great many stories about a dead mouse in soda are just stories, but a few escalated to lawsuit levels.We contacted Red Bull to determine if Bowman formally submitted his claim, but have not yet received a response.n\nClaim: An image shows a man's mostly-consumed Red Bull energy drink, after he found a dead mouse in the container.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"neutral","explanation_gpt4":"While the claim from Seth Bowman about finding a dead mouse in his Red Bull can was widely shared and discussed on social media, there is no conclusive evidence provided in the narrative to verify the authenticity of the claim. The history of similar allegations, often treated as urban legends or resulting in inconclusive legal outcomes, further complicates the verification of such claims. Additionally, the beverage companies consistently argue that their manufacturing processes would prevent such contamination, and without direct evidence from an investigation (like FDA findings in other cases) or a response from Red Bull confirming the incident, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim based on the information provided."}

That aspect of the claim mirrored age-old urban legends involving a wealthy entity opting to pay fines to the detriment of public health, a rumor that dates back to at least 2005 and (falsely) attributes\u00a0similar behavior to Coca-Cola.","fact_checkers":"Kim LaCapria","premise":"On 4 December 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement necessary for Energy Transfer Partners to complete the Dakota Access pipeline, seemingly bringing an end to months of protests over the project. By the next day, widespread rumors asserted that the decision was not as final as it seemed. In the above-reproduced examples from\u00a0e-mail and social media,\u00a0claims\u00a0have appeared that\u00a0DAPL was \u201cstill under active construction,\u201d and that Energy Transfer Partner had opted to incur a $50,000 daily fine for continuing construction on the pipeline. No specifics accompanied the rumor, such as how the\u00a0fine might be incurred, or what would happen if DAPL were constructed without the approval to do so. One version\u00a0of the rumor referenced a statement purportedly issued by ETP on the ACOE\u2019s DAPL decision of 4 December 2016: Just spoke to Matt who is standing at the front line right now. Easement was denied, however DAPL released a statement saying that they will continue drilling and just pay the $50,000 a day fine. We are not free of this black snake yet, relatives. Late on 4 December 2016, ETP did release a statement on the ACOE\u2019s denial of the necessary easement: Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) and Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (NYSE: SXL) announced that the Administration\u2019s statement today that it would not at this time issue an \u201ceasement\u201d to Dakota Access Pipeline is a purely political action \u2013 which the Administration concedes when it states it has made a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d \u2013 Washington code for a political decision. This is nothing new from this Administration, since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office. For more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules. The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. The Corps\u2019 review process and its decisions have been ratified by two federal courts. The Army Corps confirmed this again today when it stated its \u201cpolicy decision\u201d does \u201cnot alter the Army\u2019s position that the Corps\u2019 prior reviews and actions have comported with legal requirements.\u201d In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline. The White House\u2019s directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency. The statement\u2019s final paragraph indicated that ETP was not giving up on DAPL, but in no part\u00a0of that statement did they say that\u00a0the company would continue to drill. However, it did say that they plan to finish construction of the pipeline as planned, without providing details: As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. It is possible that the company\u2019s statement alongside a clearly speculative response\u00a0shared\u00a0(but not written) by prominent protester Dallas Goldtooth prompted the rumor: WILL THIS ACTUALLY STOP CONSTRUCTION? Debatable. It would be illegal for Energy Transfer Partners to drill under the Missouri, but that\u2019s not to say they won\u2019t do it and opt to pay whatever legal penalties they incur. That would be a fairly shocking move on their part but they\u2019ve hinted they may be open to doing it.

Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston.

Response from Dr Pepper was\u2026..\u201dsend us the bottle and we will let you know something in 6-8 weeks!\u201d Are you kidding me? What if my grandson drank poison or disease? This was purchased in Galveston yesterday at Valero on 39th and Broadway. Beware people. Way to stand behind your products Dr Pepper. On 9 May 2016 Graves provided further details about his claim to Houston news outlet KPRC,\u00a0stating that the rat went unnoticed for a day after his three-year-old grandson opened and consumed half of the bottle of soda. Graves didn\u2019t indicate that the soft drink tasted different or that any note was taken of the (fairly large) rodent\u2019s presence inside the bottle, and Graves himself said the rat was a \u201cpretty good size\u201d: John Graves of Katy said his 3-year-old grandson, Kayden, drank the Dr Pepper on Sunday after they bought it in Galveston. The boy was given the soft drink while he sat in his car seat. He didn\u2019t finish it, so they put the cap back on. When they opened the 20-ounce bottle the next morning, they found a rodent floating inside. \u201cPretty good size. About 3 inches long, with a big tail,\u201d Graves said. They immediately took Kayden to his pediatrician to undergo some tests. Blood and urine samples were taken, and the state of Texas and the Centers for Disease Control were contact. They are now waiting for the results. Graves said\u00a0that a Dr Pepper spokesperson requested the bottle and rat be submitted to the company for testing, but that he was concerned about maintaining the sample\u2019s integrity and sought an independent analysis of the specimen: The family also contacted Dr Pepper. A spokesperson told them and KPRC 2 that they want the bottle so they can run tests on it \u2026 the Graves family wants to have its own testing done before handing the bottle over to Dr Pepper\u2019s people. \u201cI want to get the rat tested to see where it came from, how it got there, if there is any medical concerns we should be concerned about,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThere is no telling what could happen to that sample.\u201d As of Tuesday, the family was working with Dr Pepper to figure out if the rodent could be sent to an independent lab in Houston.

Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa.

Fox cited an anonymous source to claim \u201cwell-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods\u201d were targets for \u201cantifa\u201d:Agitators behind the rioting that has paralyzed the country over the past week want to move into more suburban areas, a government intelligence source has told Fox News.Much of the worry stems from the notion that many in well-armed, suburban, and rural neighborhoods won\u2019t hesitate to exercise their Second Amendment rights and elevated anxieties could lead to heavy confrontation.\u201cAntifa knows this,\u201d said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cLocal and state authorities have to get a grip on this because if it moves to the suburbs, more people will die.\u201dSubsequently, Fox News quoted yet another anonymous source in an effort to substantiate the rumors:An NYPD source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, concurred that fears were escalating in suburban pockets of New York state following a rash of rumors pertaining to looting starting there.\u201cPeople in other places like Suffolk County are worrying, preparing for the worst,\u201d said the source. \u201cThere is just a lot of confusion and fear.\u201dConfusion and fear spreading doubtlessly in part due to sourceless Fox News claims that \u201cantifa\u201d planned to attack and raid \u201cwell-armed\u201d neighborhoods.As of July 1 2020, none of the claims in that article had come to pass \u2014 although they clearly continued spreading on Facebook, fueled by imagination, anxiety, and the usual disinformation purveyors.A Likely SourceOn June 1 2020, NBC News reported that white supremacists posing as \u201cantifa\u201d created a Twitter account and spread the same rumors circulating on Facebook in July 2020.U-Haul trucks were not mentioned, but the core of the rumor was nearly identical:A Twitter account claiming to belong to a national \u201cantifa\u201d organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, according to a Twitter spokesperson.The spokesperson said the account violated the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically the creation of fake accounts. Twitter suspended the account after a tweet that incited violence.As protests were taking place in multiple states across the U.S. [on May 31 2020], the newly created account, @ANTIFA_US, tweeted, \u201cTonight\u2019s the night, Comrades,\u201d with a brown raised fist emoji and \u201cTonight we say \u2018F\u2014 The City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026. and we take what\u2019s ours \u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has taken action against fake accounts engaged in hateful conduct linked to Identity Evropa, according to the spokesperson.In other words, the rumor was started by white supremacists and accelerationists in an effort to fuel tensions and foment violence.TL;DRLike a game of telephone, a rumor that \u201cantifa U-Hauls\u201d were moving into \u201cresidential neighborhoods\u201d for unspecified \u201cattacks\u201d appeared to stem directly from a fake anti-fascist account created by the virulent white supremacist group Identity Evropa. Two days later, Twitter nuisance Jack Posobiec and Fox News spread iterations of the claim; predictably, no such \u201cinvasion\u201d came to pass. A similar and likely directly related rumor circulated about \u201cantifa buses\u201d in Ada, Oklahoma, and it too was false. In particular, the \u201cantifa U-Haul\u201d rumor posed a risk to customers of U-Haul, who were at risk specifically if they were moving into a new neighborhood where the rumor had taken root.Comments\"n\nClaim: \"Antifa is renting U-Hauls to quietly infiltrate \"\"residential neighborhoods\"\" for \"\"attacks.\"\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that 'Antifa is renting U-Hauls to quietly infiltrate residential neighborhoods for attacks' originated from an unsourced social media post and was further spread by dubious sources, including a Fox News article citing anonymous sources. Additionally, NBC News reported that a similar rumor was propagated by a fake Twitter account linked to the white supremacist group Identity Evropa, which was designed to incite fear and violence under the guise of 'antifa' activities. This misinformation was intended to fuel tensions rather than report factual events. No verifiable evidence supports the claim, and it aligns with patterns of disinformation historically debunked in similar contexts."}

Reporter Bill Melugin posted a photograph of the alleged tampon on Twitter:The officer was reportedly not wearing his uniform and paid for the drink with a debit card issued by a police credit union.We contacted Target seeking comment; the company sent us the same statement it gave to KTTV:We take this allegation seriously. We have reviewed video footage and have not found any suspicious behavior. We have shared the video with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and look forward to the conclusions of their investigation.Reached for comment and asked how the officer determined that the alleged object was a tampon, the sheriff\u2019s department also shared a statement:Walnut Station Detectives are investigating an incident of alleged poisoning of food or drink at a local business. The incident was reported to have occurred Friday, June 19, 2020 at approximately 2:30p.m., on the 700 block of Grand Avenue in the city of Diamond Bar. The victim as a male White 36 years-old. This is an ongoing investigation. No further information is available at this time.The claim was formally debunked in late July 2020, when \u2014\u00a0according to KTTV \u2014 police determined that there was no \u201cattack.\u201d The staff member who prepared the drink unwittingly \u201cscooped up a cleaning cloth that had fallen into ice\u201d into the officer\u2019s drink.\u201cThe investigation was unable to prove malicious intent on the part of the store employee,\u201d Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing local officers, initially called the alleged incident a \u201cdisgusting assault on a police officer was carried out by someone with hatred in their heart.\u201dBut even before the company\u2019s statement, the claim of \u201cassault\u201d drew skepticism. Two separate news sites, Jezebel and Vice, conducted their own tests to see whether a tampon dipped into a Frappuccino would come out looking like the object in Melugin\u2019s photo. The results of both tests ran counter to police allegations. According to Jezebel\u2019s Megan Reynolds:The substance found in the Frappuccino does not resemble any sort of tampon that I\u2019ve ever used or seen in the wild. It\u2019s long, it\u2019s clumpy, and if you look at it quickly, resembles a cat hairball or maybe some paper towels. A tampon doesn\u2019t expand lengthwise and if it did, the shape would be uniform and not lumpen and irregular, as this item is. Tampons expand widthwise to accommodate a wide variety of body shapes and types. Everyone\u2019s vagina is different, but a tampon that resembled housing insulation or a long clot of cotton batting would be entirely ineffective.Meanwhile, Vice reported that the object posted in Melugin\u2019s photograph measured 4.957 inches, nearly an inch longer than the final length of the tampon the site used to recreate the alleged incident by soaking it in water and then leaving it inside a Frappuccino for two hours.\u201cSuspicious, but not outside the realm of possibility for a lesser-quality tampon,\u201d Vice noted. \u201cOther things to keep in mind is that it appears the very bottom of the tampon is cut off in the photo uploaded to Twitter, and we do not know what zoom the image was taken at.\u201dThe intentional poisoning claim from Los Angeles police came less than a month after police union officials in New York City accused workers at a Shake Shack restaurant in Manhattan of doing the same to their own colleagues. As the New York Post reported:A lieutenant from the Bronx blasted out an email to the unions that six cops \u201cstarted throwing up after drinking beverages they got from shake shack on 200 Broadway.\u201dIt was unclear why the sergeant and lieutenant escalated the situation.Detectives easily closed the case after interviewing five employees and reviewing surveillance footage showing the shakes were made normally, sources said.The machine was cleaned before the officers ordered, according to sources, and it still contained residual milkstone remover \u2014 a typically acidic solution used to combat buildup in dairy equipment.But by 10:45 p.m., the Detectives Endowment Association was declaring that Finest had become \u201cill\u201d after being \u201cintentionally poisoned by one or more workers at the Shake Shack\u201d \u2014 as Police Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch made a show of visiting Bellevue while his union declared at 10:47 p.m. that police officers came \u201cunder attack\u201d from a \u201ctoxic substance, believed to be bleach.\u201dThe allegation was debunked only one day later when Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison posted, \u201cAfter a thorough investigation by the NYPD\u2019s Manhattan South investigators, it has been determined that there was no criminality by shake shack\u2019s employees.\u201dIt is worth noting that the \u201cshunned policeman\u201d is a known urban legend \u2014 a subtheme of the \u201cshunned serviceman\u201d folklore.

One related episode took place in the spring of 2018, when an initiative by the University of Texas (UT) prompted claims that \u201cliberals\u201d at that school were calling for masculinity to be designated as a mental illness. For example, the Constitution.com web site wrote: The insane, mentally deranged liberals at the University of Texas now want masculinity to be designated as a mental illness \u2026 [The] purported \u201ccounseling\u201d department at the university started a program to \u201chelp\u201d male students \u201ctake control over their gender identity and develop a healthy sense of masculinity \u2026\u201d The creators of this foolish left-wing circlejerk claim that it is that danged old \u201crestrictive masculinity\u201d that forces men to \u201cact like a man\u201d and that encourages men to be \u201ctoo masculine.\u201d This program wants people to stop saying men should be a \u201cbreadwinner\u201d or that they should strive for success in their careers. Men need to be wimpy, subservient, spineless, and unable to make a decision without a woman to tell them how to think and what to do. The conservative PJ Media web site similarly reported that the program amounted to \u201ctreating masculinity as if it were a mental health crisis,\u201d and the popular morning television show Fox & Friends claimed UT was \u201cnow treating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d: University of Texas to treat masculinity as a \u2018mental health\u2019 issue pic.twitter.com\/BtZdfclfMG \u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 29, 2018  In reality, nobody at the university\u2019s Counselling and Mental Health Center, liberal or otherwise, called for masculinity to be \u201cdesignated a mental illness\u201d or treated as a mental health issue. That characterization of the new program came from the Fox & Friends TV program and the PJ Media web site, not from those behind the initiative itself. The emphasis on \u201cmental health\u201d in all three reports appeared to stem from no more than the fact that it was the Counselling and Mental Health Center that was behind the program. In response to these misleading and sensationalist reports, the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT took the step of directly refuting the \u201cmental health issue\u201d claim in a statement posted on the school\u2019s web site: The MasculinUT program does not treat masculinity as a \u201cmental health issue,\u201d and any such statements are simply not accurate. It was established to bring more men to the table to address interpersonal violence, sexual assault and other issues. Like other UT programs related to sexual assault and interpersonal violence, MasculinUT is housed administratively in the university\u2019s Counseling and Mental Health Center. Its goals include helping men explore ways to reduce sexual violence, helping students take responsibility for their actions, and fostering healthier relationships on campus and beyond. Based on the promotional material and information on the MasculinUT web site, the closest the program\u2019s designers came to \u201ctreating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d was one section which listed \u201cemotional and mental health problems\u201d as one of four or five possible negative consequences of \u201cespousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity\u201d: Attending to masculinity can illuminate many important issues and take us a step closer to creating a dialogue for gender equity. Specifically for college students, research shows that espousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity results in men underperforming in college, participating in risky behavior that affects their health (such as binge drinking or drug use), and developing particular emotional and mental health problems that cannot be addressed unless we understand the specific vulnerabilities created by certain aspects of masculinity. The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine. This definition of masculinity also restricts what is acceptable in terms of appearance. This also makes it exclusionary, because a restrictive definition of masculinity depends on excluding people from that definition. Students who do not feel what a \u201creal man\u201d should feel, think the way a \u201creal man\u201d thinks, or looks the way a \u201creal man\u201d is supposed to look are vulnerable to violence from others who cannot accept male students who stray from this narrow definition. Students who feel targeted are also at risk of engaging in violent behavior in an attempt to not be the target of violence.

One related episode took place in the spring of 2018, when an initiative by the University of Texas (UT) prompted claims that \u201cliberals\u201d at that school were calling for masculinity to be designated as a mental illness. For example, the Constitution.com web site wrote: The insane, mentally deranged liberals at the University of Texas now want masculinity to be designated as a mental illness \u2026 [The] purported \u201ccounseling\u201d department at the university started a program to \u201chelp\u201d male students \u201ctake control over their gender identity and develop a healthy sense of masculinity \u2026\u201d The creators of this foolish left-wing circlejerk claim that it is that danged old \u201crestrictive masculinity\u201d that forces men to \u201cact like a man\u201d and that encourages men to be \u201ctoo masculine.\u201d This program wants people to stop saying men should be a \u201cbreadwinner\u201d or that they should strive for success in their careers. Men need to be wimpy, subservient, spineless, and unable to make a decision without a woman to tell them how to think and what to do. The conservative PJ Media web site similarly reported that the program amounted to \u201ctreating masculinity as if it were a mental health crisis,\u201d and the popular morning television show Fox & Friends claimed UT was \u201cnow treating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d: University of Texas to treat masculinity as a \u2018mental health\u2019 issue pic.twitter.com\/BtZdfclfMG \u2014 FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 29, 2018  In reality, nobody at the university\u2019s Counselling and Mental Health Center, liberal or otherwise, called for masculinity to be \u201cdesignated a mental illness\u201d or treated as a mental health issue. That characterization of the new program came from the Fox & Friends TV program and the PJ Media web site, not from those behind the initiative itself. The emphasis on \u201cmental health\u201d in all three reports appeared to stem from no more than the fact that it was the Counselling and Mental Health Center that was behind the program. In response to these misleading and sensationalist reports, the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT took the step of directly refuting the \u201cmental health issue\u201d claim in a statement posted on the school\u2019s web site: The MasculinUT program does not treat masculinity as a \u201cmental health issue,\u201d and any such statements are simply not accurate. It was established to bring more men to the table to address interpersonal violence, sexual assault and other issues. Like other UT programs related to sexual assault and interpersonal violence, MasculinUT is housed administratively in the university\u2019s Counseling and Mental Health Center. Its goals include helping men explore ways to reduce sexual violence, helping students take responsibility for their actions, and fostering healthier relationships on campus and beyond. Based on the promotional material and information on the MasculinUT web site, the closest the program\u2019s designers came to \u201ctreating masculinity as a mental health issue\u201d was one section which listed \u201cemotional and mental health problems\u201d as one of four or five possible negative consequences of \u201cespousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity\u201d: Attending to masculinity can illuminate many important issues and take us a step closer to creating a dialogue for gender equity. Specifically for college students, research shows that espousing very restrictive aspects of masculinity results in men underperforming in college, participating in risky behavior that affects their health (such as binge drinking or drug use), and developing particular emotional and mental health problems that cannot be addressed unless we understand the specific vulnerabilities created by certain aspects of masculinity. The MasculinUT program\u2019s web material described \u201crestrictive masculinity,\u201d a target of particular scorn for critics of the program, in the following way: MasculinUT recognizes unhealthy masculinity as restrictive and exclusionary in the sense that it only affords a narrow definition of what it means to be masculine. This definition of masculinity also restricts what is acceptable in terms of appearance. This also makes it exclusionary, because a restrictive definition of masculinity depends on excluding people from that definition. Students who do not feel what a \u201creal man\u201d should feel, think the way a \u201creal man\u201d thinks, or looks the way a \u201creal man\u201d is supposed to look are vulnerable to violence from others who cannot accept male students who stray from this narrow definition. Students who feel targeted are also at risk of engaging in violent behavior in an attempt to not be the target of violence. Restricting the definition of masculinity can turn students into \u201cpressure cookers,\u201d where if a student is not allowed to express all of their emotions and thoughts, these just build up and can explode in various, unhealthy ways (such as violent behavior or coping mechanisms such as drinking). Since 2015, MasculinUT has been run by Voices Against Violence, an initiative overseen by the Counselling and Mental Health Center at UT, which produces programming to prevent and respond to interpersonal violence, including sexual assault.

The evidence clearly indicates that the University of Texas' Counselling and Mental Health Center, through their MasculinUT program, did not treat or label masculinity as a mental health issue. Instead, the program was aimed at addressing issues like sexual assault and interpersonal violence by encouraging a healthier sense of masculinity. Misinterpretations and sensationalist reporting by certain media outlets contributed to the spread of this inaccurate claim.

Although this sartorial fad is overwhelmingly favored by young males, it is not limited to them \u2014 young women have at times likewise indulged in the urge to sag. The practice, which did begin in prisons, worked its way from the hoosegow into hip hop culture. It was adopted by a variety of rap artists, such as Ice-T and Too Short, which enhanced its perceived tough-guy cachet. Sagging can even be taken a step further by wearing the droopy breeches backwards. (Totally Krossed Out, the 1992 debut album of Kriss Kross, shows the pair of 13-year-old rappers doing this.) By 1995 the style had seeped into mainstream teen culture \u2014 one no longer needed to be a wannabe \u201cgangsta\u201d to sling \u2019em low.

{"claim_id":14162,"hypothesis":"\"Water rates in Manila, Philippines, \"\"were raised up to 845 percent\"\" when a subsidiary of the World Bank became a partial owner.\"","date_published":"May 12, 2016","explanation_1":"Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family\u2019s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before. Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFC\u2019s equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start.","fact_checkers":"Jon Greenberg","premise":"\"If a city can\u2019t provide safe drinking water, should it turn the whole operation over to a private company? No, we\u2019re not talking about Flint, Mich. This concerns the southeast Asian city of Manila, the capital and\u00a0biggest city in the Philippines. In 1997, officials in the Pacific island nation set up not one but two private companies to deliver water to homes and businesses. One of those companies has been a financial success. So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation\u2019s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. \"\"In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent,\"\" Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose\u00a0by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore\u2019s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging. The soundest data we could find was in a 2013 report from local regulators, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took\u00a0place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate  (pesos\/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a  typical bill Typical household bill  (1997 pesos) 121 295 537  As you\u2019ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila\u2019s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization \"\"was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s.\"\" The IFC\u2019s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked.

But Nathaniel Meyer, a senior organizer with the advocacy group Corporate Accountability International, said from a household perspective, what really matters is how much you pay. \"\"If a family in Manila in 1997 paid 4 pesos for their water and it\u2019s gone up in absolute pesos, that's going to leave them less for food, health care, clothes for the kids and everything else,\"\" Meyer said. We ran the numbers for a household paying the average rate on 30 cubic meters of water a month. In its publications, Manila Water says 30 cubic meters is the amount used by the typical household. In inflation-corrected pesos, the typical bill went up about 20 percent faster each year after 2004 than before. Our ruling Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moore\u2019s staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. It is also true that in terms of the actual size of a family\u2019s water bill, rates rose faster each year after the IFC bought its share than before. Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFC\u2019s equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start.","sources":"http:\/\/ifcextapps.ifc.org\/ifcext\/spiwebsite1.nsf\/78e3b305216fcdba85257a8b0075079d\/8c26a1534a226766852576ba000e25ef?opendocument, https:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/article\/d7a847b72e18485b8a4800f27cbdc5b8\/us-rep-blasts-ifc-conflict-interest-manila-water-plan, https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/0o5zstls4g7b2md\/MWSS-RO-Resolution-No.13-009-CA-Manila-Water.pdf?dl=0, http:\/\/www.circleofblue.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/Insead_Water_Privatization_Manila_Philippines.pdf, http:\/\/mirror.unhabitat.org\/pmss\/%28X%281%29S%28g5evq3o0wz2yo4y1z23lrssh%29%29\/listItemDetails.aspx?publicationID=1150&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1, http:\/\/www.globalwaterforum.org\/2013\/01\/23\/the-cautious-expansion-of-water-privatization-in-low-and-middle-income-countries\/, http:\/\/ageconsearch.umn.edu\/bitstream\/30650\/1\/cr060123.pdf, http:\/\/www.manilawater.com\/Pages\/ReadNews.aspx?MBID=209, http:\/\/ifcextapps.ifc.org\/ifcext\/spiwebsite1.nsf\/78e3b305216fcdba85257a8b0075079d\/050652ac3b2056c3852576c10080cd0b?opendocument, http:\/\/www.gwp.org\/Global\/ToolBox\/Case%20Studies\/Asia%20and%20Caucasus\/CS_450_TAP_%20Manila.pdf, http:\/\/www.waterlinks.org\/system\/resources\/W1siZiIsIjIwMTUvMDUvMDYvNjg1ajVuYnZicV9NYW5pbGFfV2F0ZXJfV2F0ZXJfZm9yX3RoZV9Qb29yLnBkZiJdXQ\/Manila%20Water%20-%20Water%20for%20the%20Poor.pdf?sha=0900f838407d99d7, http:\/\/ifcextapps.ifc.org\/ifcext\/spiwebsite1.nsf\/78e3b305216fcdba85257a8b0075079d\/710a2eb406002edc852576ba000e23e4?opendocument, https:\/\/www.icij.org\/project\/water-barons\/loaves-fishes-and-dirty-dishes, http:\/\/ifcextapps.ifc.org\/ifcext\/spiwebsite1.nsf\/78e3b305216fcdba85257a8b0075079d\/32a3b7cbe6049bb185257b5d00603bc0?opendocument, https:\/\/gwenmoore.house.gov\/uploads\/MooreIFCLetter%20FINAL.pdf","label":3,"subjects":"Global News Service, Financial Regulation, Foreign Policy, Water, Gwen Moore, ","__index_level_0__":1157,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\n\"If a city can\u2019t provide safe drinking water, should it turn the whole operation over to a private company? No, we\u2019re not talking about Flint, Mich. This concerns the southeast Asian city of Manila, the capital and\u00a0biggest city in the Philippines. In 1997, officials in the Pacific island nation set up not one but two private companies to deliver water to homes and businesses. One of those companies has been a financial success. So healthy, that the private banking arm of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, became a part-owner in 2004 for about $15 million. During a hearing on April 27, 2016, the International Finance Corporation\u2019s role drew criticism from Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis. \"\"In Manila, for example, when the IFC, the development arm, took an equity position in the water company, water rates were raised up to 845 percent,\"\" Moore said. She was pressing a Treasury Department official on how to make international development banks more accountable. We decided to see whether residents had to pay more than eight times as much for their water once the International Finance Corporation bought a stake in the Manila Water Company. What we found, between 2004, when the IFC bought its share of the company, and 2012, is that rates did climb. But they only rose\u00a0by about 170 percent, not the 845 percent Moore cited. Moore\u2019s office said she relied on a 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives. Making apples-to-apples comparisons of rates is challenging. The soundest data we could find was in a 2013 report from local regulators, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. This table shows the average price (in Philippine pesos) of a cubic meter of water at three points, when privatization took\u00a0place in 1997, when the IFC gained part ownership in 2004 and 2012. 1997 2004 2012 Average rate  (pesos\/cubic meter) 4.02 14 38.12 Change from 1997 (percent) 248% 848% Change from 2004 (percent) 172% PolitiFact analysis of a  typical bill Typical household bill  (1997 pesos) 121 295 537  As you\u2019ll see, the increase from 1997 to 2012 was 848 percent, near the increase Moore claimed. The 2010 resolution from the Philippines House of Representatives said that the cost of water rose by 845 percent between 1997 and 2009. The problem, though, is that the IFC did not become a part owner until 2004. The rate increase between that year and 2012 was about 170 percent. There are a few other important dimensions to bring into the picture. A better water service By the mid 1990s, Manila\u2019s public water system was in crisis. About a third of the city\u2019s residents, roughly 3.5 million people, had no running water. Leaks and water theft were literally draining the pipes. Water pressure could drop at any moment, leaving many with a completely unpredictable water supply. Cholera and infection-related diarrhea were on the rise. The Philippine government turned to the World Bank, which brought in the International Finance Corporation to devise a privatization plan. Gregory Pierce, a lecturer at Urban Planning at UCLA, told us privatization \"\"was a big fad in the early to mid 1990s.\"\" The IFC\u2019s role was advisory, but the framework it crafted produced the circumstances that exist today. Major capital investments, and rising rates to pay for them, were part of the plan. In other words, while Moore linked her comment to the year when the IFC took an equity position, its involvement dates back years earlier to the launch of a privatized water system. The Manila metro area was divided into two zones, and an international consortium, that included the American Bechtel Corporation, was the winning bidder for the eastern section. The company was called Manila Water. Manila Water soon spent over $300 million to install more than 1,200 kilometers of piping. The good news is, by every measure, quality and reliability went up. In 2007, an article in Economics and Management in Developing Countries reported that by 2002, the fraction of people with service had gone from about 60 percent to over 80 percent. Unlike before 1997, the water moving through the pipes met government drinking water standards. Leaks were repaired twice as quickly and while service might drop out, the average went from taps running 17 hours a day before the change to 21 hours a day afterward. As the authors of the journal article put it, \"\"If one goes by the numbers for water coverage, availability and quality, water privatization in Metro Manila seemed to have worked. However, water rates had risen dramatically during the same period.\"\" Frederick Jones, a spokesman for the International Finance Corporation, said the benefits have been widely shared. \"\"While tariffs have increased for some residents of Manila, many of the people not previously connected to water services were poor families, who were forced to pay $3 a cubic meter for bottled water on the open market,\"\" Jones said. \"\"Today, the average tariff in Manila is $1.30, but this tariff is helping subsidize the poorest families, who now only pay 18 cents per cubic meter.\"\" Two ways to look at price hikes Moore couched her claim in terms of the percentage rise in the cost of water.

The rates did increase significantly after the privatization, which involved the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of the World Bank. However, the 845 percent increase applies to the period from 1997 to 2012, not specifically from 2004 (when the IFC became a part-owner) to 2012. From 2004 to 2012, the rates increased by about 170 percent. Therefore, while the rates did indeed rise significantly, the specific figure cited is incorrect for the period after the IFC's involvement began. Moreover, the IFC was involved in crafting the privatization plan from the start, indicating a broader influence on the water rate increases."}

On the safety record for nicotine gum all we got in this story was one health behavior specialist saying, \u201cThere really doesn\u2019t appear to be any great harm.\u201d And a British regulatory proclamation that \u201cthere are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects.\u201d\u00a0 Statements like \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to be\u201d and \u201cno grounds to suspect\u201d could be haunting some day. The story states that NRT products have \u201camassed a strong safety record\u201d but we\u2019re never given any details. We also wish it had presented a more balanced perspective from the sources quoted. The two nicotine replacement users are probably not examples of how nicotine products are used widely. The use of nicotine replacement at high dose for 15 years is well outside any regulatory boundaries anywhere. As the story points out, \u201cAbout one in five American adults smokes\u2014a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004.\u201d As other studies have found, about 1 out of every 5 preventable deaths is also due to smoking. This is a massive public health challenge. People take up smoking and continue to do so despite the known risks for a variety of reasons. Just about 50% of smokers attempt to quit each year. Most fail. A major reason for the failure is the addictive power of nicotine. A story that highlights the public and personal health issues associated with smoking and smoking cessation is always welcome.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"The story did not discuss costs, and this was a missed opportunity.

The University of Pennsylvania study, which studied the nicotine patch and not gum, failed to show any difference in smoking rates at the end of one year, even though it did show a difference up to the 24 weeks of treatment. So, the bottom line suggested in the story is that people are likely to stay off cigarettes as long as they can get nicotine in some other form. While that seems reasonable on face value, we are only given a couple of anecdotes and a partial rendering of a single study. The two anecdotes provided strongly suggest that continuing an ongoing use of nicotine replacement for years is both acceptable and safe. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. The story only quoted one scientist in a story that was ostensibly all about the science. Instead, it spent more time with nicotine gum users and a blogger.

Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready \u2013 even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,\"\" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week\u2019s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday \u2013 about 23,000 \u2013 was also well below last week\u2019s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it\u2019s time to reopen the economy in \"\"a gradual and safe way,\"\" Kelly said. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it\u2019s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don\u2019t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey and other Republicans are pushing for. Hospital capacity will be tested again once social distancing ends, and a new Washington Post analysis shows that in many parts of the country, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, it won\u2019t hold up. A team of Post reporters analyzed the availability of critical care resources across the country using data sets assembled by Definitive Healthcare, an analytics company that mines government filings, including those of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as commercial insurance claims. Imagining a scenario where the coronavirus infects two in 10 adults over the next year, the reporters found a patchwork of possible preparedness shortcomings in cities and towns where the full force of the virus has yet to hit and where people may not be following isolation and social distancing orders. The Post determined that more than half of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients. Parts of Pennsylvania that border Maryland and Ohio would fall especially short, the Post found. Making the case to reopen the nation\u2019s economy, Toomey said, \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections.\"\" Data on coronavirus case counts and fatalities show that the country\u2019s outbreak is subsiding.

Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready \u2013 even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,\"\" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week\u2019s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday \u2013 about 23,000 \u2013 was also well below last week\u2019s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it\u2019s time to reopen the economy in \"\"a gradual and safe way,\"\" Kelly said. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it\u2019s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don\u2019t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey and other Republicans are pushing for. Hospital capacity will be tested again once social distancing ends, and a new Washington Post analysis shows that in many parts of the country, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, it won\u2019t hold up. A team of Post reporters analyzed the availability of critical care resources across the country using data sets assembled by Definitive Healthcare, an analytics company that mines government filings, including those of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as commercial insurance claims. Imagining a scenario where the coronavirus infects two in 10 adults over the next year, the reporters found a patchwork of possible preparedness shortcomings in cities and towns where the full force of the virus has yet to hit and where people may not be following isolation and social distancing orders. The Post determined that more than half of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients. Parts of Pennsylvania that border Maryland and Ohio would fall especially short, the Post found. Making the case to reopen the nation\u2019s economy, Toomey said, \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections.\"\" Data on coronavirus case counts and fatalities show that the country\u2019s outbreak is subsiding. But Toomey\u2019s comments don\u2019t account for what will happen once social distancing ends.

The evidence suggests that while current data shows a decrease in new cases and fatalities, indicating a possible peak, models and analyses warn that relaxing social distancing could lead to a resurgence of the virus, particularly in areas that are currently underprepared in terms of healthcare capacity. Therefore, the claim is partially true in reflecting recent data, but false in potentially underestimating future risks."}

The story doesn\u2019t go over-the-top in its characterization of how Botox shots for incontinence could help people, and especially women (who disproportionately deal with the problem). It also hedges the benefits well and discusses the primary potential harm of Botox injections for severe incontinence.

{"claim_id":24581,"hypothesis":"As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance.","date_published":"August 20, 2009","explanation_1":"Pascrell says up to 22,000 Americans die yearly because they don\u2019t have health insurance","fact_checkers":"Louis Jacobson","premise":"\"On July 30, 2009, PolitiFact rated as True a statement by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey that \"\"as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance.\"\" We based that ruling on the same study that Pascrell did. Subsequently, a reader pointed out a paper published last spring in the online edition of the journal HSR: Health Services Research that contradicts the study Pascrell relied on. So we are changing our rating to  and providing this new analysis. Much of the push for reforming the nation's health care system has been driven by concerns about uninsured Americans. So it's no surprise that a statistic on the number of Americans who die every year due to lack of health insurance has been used frequently in speeches and opinion columns. However, this statistic, which stems from a report by an influential, quasi-governmental institution, is quietly coming under academic attack. When Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said on July 30 that \"\"as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance,\"\" the number he cited was an updated version of one originally calculated by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine. In 2002, an IOM panel of more than a dozen medical specialists estimated that 18,000 Americans died in 2000 because they were uninsured. They came up with this figure by looking at long-term studies that measured the links between insurance status and death rates. The IOM then used annual statistics on insurance rates and deaths to determine an estimate of extra deaths attributable to the lack of insurance. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM's study with newer data. Replicating the Institute of Medicine's methodology, Dorn concluded that the 18,000 figure should be increased to 22,000 \u2014 the figure later cited by Pascrell. Given the Institute of Medicine's prestige and Pascrell's caution in saying that \"\"as many as\"\" 22,000 Americans die annually from a lack of insurance, which signaled some uncertainty about the exact number, we gave the congressman a True rating. But a more recent paper raises questions about the IOM's conclusions. The paper, published online in April in HSR: Health Services Research, is by Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine. Using data on adult health and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is a part of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kronick concludes that the Institute of Medicine's estimate (or any that replicates its methodology, such as Dorn's) is \"\"almost certainly incorrect.\"\" Pascrell's office was not aware of the paper when he made his statement and we did not find it when we researched his claim. The most notable difference between the Institute of Medicine's data \u2014 which were drawn from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey as well as the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey \u2014 is that Kronick adjusted it for a number of demographic and health factors, such as status as a smoker and body mass index. When he did that, \"\"the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance.\"\" In other words, once you compare death rates in an apples-to-apples fashion \u2014 comparing insured smokers to uninsured smokers, for instance \u2014 the likelihood of dying evens out. This, in turn, would mean that IOM's estimate of 18,000 deaths would drop essentially to zero. In his paper, Kronick acknowledges that this is a \"\"counterintuitive\"\" result, possibly resulting from the safety net of public hospitals and community clinics providing \"\"'good enough' access to care for the uninsured to keep their mortality rate similar to that of the insured.\"\" Either way, he writes, \"\"there would not be much change in the number of deaths in the United States as a result of universal coverage, although the difficulties of inferring causality from observational analyses temper the strength of this conclusion.\"\" We ran Kronick's paper by a number of health care policy experts to see whether they thought it undercut the Institute of Medicine's death estimate. Everyone agreed that both Kronick personally and the journal that published him are credible. Because the significance of his finding could also have political consequences \u2014 on June 24, for instance, John Goodman, president of the conservative National Center for Policy Analysis, testified to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health that we \"\"do not know how much morbidity and mortality is attributable to lack of health insurance\"\" \u2014 we also wanted to determine whether there may be any ideological bias at work. But we found no evidence of it. In fact, far from having ties to the conservative movement, Kronick served as a senior health care policy adviser in the Clinton administration, where, according to his biography, he contributed to the development of the Clinton health care reform proposal. Kronick's articles have appeared in the  New England Journal of Medicine  and the  Journal of the American Medical Association  , and his work has at times been funded by the Commonwealth Fund, whose mission is \"\"to promote a high-performing health care system\"\" that aids \"\"society's most vulnerable,\"\" including \"\"the uninsured.\"\" Kronick even told PolitiFact that his finding was \"\"not the answer I wanted\"\" and, as a result, he agonized over whether to publish it or not. He said he's \"\"grateful\"\" that it has so far been unnoticed in the increasingly hostile debate over health care. \"\"I don't have a whole lot of friends, and will probably lose a few over this,\"\" he told us. \"\"And I might make some friends I didn't want.\"\" But a number of experts we spoke to are glad that Kronick did publish it. Henry Aaron, a health policy specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that he was impressed by Kronick's research from the time Kronick presented an early draft of it at a Brookings lunch seminar. \"\"I found his reasoning compelling,\"\" said Aaron, himself a member of the Institute of Medicine. \"\"In fact, after listening to his presentation, I had a hard time believing that the IOM had done what they had done.\"\" In interviews, Aaron and other health care scholars agreed with Kronick that uninsured and insured Americans differ in many ways other than their insurance status. \"\"To estimate the impact of the lack of insurance on mortality rates, one has to control statistically for all of those differences,\"\" Aaron said. That, he added, is exactly what Kronick has sought to do so. Robert Book, a senior research fellow in health economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, agrees with Aaron. \"\"I would be more inclined to believe Kronick's than other studies,\"\" he said, \"\"I'm just surprised the IOM did their study without controlling for other factors.\"\" Book also praised Kronick\u2019s decision to run calculations with numerous alternative models, and to remove various factors, one at a time, from the calculations. \"\"From the standpoint of a careful econometric study, Kronick\u2019s paper is excellent,\"\" Book said. \"\"I\u2019ve seen few papers that are this thorough in terms of seeking alternate explanations for their conclusions.\"\" Other health policy specialists we talked to were open to the idea of Kronick being right, while urging caution before overruling the Institute of Medicine estimate. Dorn, the Urban Institute researcher, pointed to a second study published by the Institute of Medicine on Feb. 24, 2009. This 268-page volume, America's Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care, provides a detailed analysis of subsequent studies on the topic. While it didn\u2019t provide a new estimate of extra deaths from uninsurance, the new Institute of Medicine study concluded that \"\"the body of evidence on the health consequences of health insurance is stronger than ever before.\"\" Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund and an Institute of Medicine member, said that the existence of Kronick's study \"\"doesn't convince me yet not to use the IOM study,\"\" but she added that \"\"if I saw a few more, I might be convinced. I tend to believe things when I see multiple studies using different databases and methodologies come to the same conclusion.\"\" (Aaron said he agreed with Davis on this point.) For the record, an IOM spokeswoman said the institute has not assessed Kronick's paper and thus had no comment on its assertions. On one key point, the Institute of Medicine and Kronick actually aren't that far apart. Kronick said he doesn't doubt that individuals' health suffers when they're uninsured \u2014 he just hasn't found evidence that they die sooner. \"\"No one would choose not to have insurance if they could afford it,\"\" Kronick said. \"\"There's no benefit to having 47 million Americans uninsured.\"\" When we asked Pascrell\u2019s office whether the Kronick study would change their view, spokesman Paul Brubaker said it would not. \"\"The point of the congressman\u2019s statistic is to show a direct correlation between one\u2019s ability to pay and the ability to have insurance, and therefore on their ability to be healthy,\u201d Brubaker said. But for us, Kronick\u2019s study raises questions about the reliability of the Institute of Medicine\u2019s death estimate. We acknowledge that there is not yet a consensus among the experts.

Bill Pascrell of New Jersey that \"\"as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance.\"\" We based that ruling on the same study that Pascrell did. Subsequently, a reader pointed out a paper published last spring in the online edition of the journal HSR: Health Services Research that contradicts the study Pascrell relied on. So we are changing our rating to  and providing this new analysis. Much of the push for reforming the nation's health care system has been driven by concerns about uninsured Americans. So it's no surprise that a statistic on the number of Americans who die every year due to lack of health insurance has been used frequently in speeches and opinion columns. However, this statistic, which stems from a report by an influential, quasi-governmental institution, is quietly coming under academic attack. When Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said on July 30 that \"\"as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance,\"\" the number he cited was an updated version of one originally calculated by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine. In 2002, an IOM panel of more than a dozen medical specialists estimated that 18,000 Americans died in 2000 because they were uninsured. They came up with this figure by looking at long-term studies that measured the links between insurance status and death rates. The IOM then used annual statistics on insurance rates and deaths to determine an estimate of extra deaths attributable to the lack of insurance. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM's study with newer data. Replicating the Institute of Medicine's methodology, Dorn concluded that the 18,000 figure should be increased to 22,000 \u2014 the figure later cited by Pascrell. Given the Institute of Medicine's prestige and Pascrell's caution in saying that \"\"as many as\"\" 22,000 Americans die annually from a lack of insurance, which signaled some uncertainty about the exact number, we gave the congressman a True rating. But a more recent paper raises questions about the IOM's conclusions. The paper, published online in April in HSR: Health Services Research, is by Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine. Using data on adult health and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is a part of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kronick concludes that the Institute of Medicine's estimate (or any that replicates its methodology, such as Dorn's) is \"\"almost certainly incorrect.\"\" Pascrell's office was not aware of the paper when he made his statement and we did not find it when we researched his claim. The most notable difference between the Institute of Medicine's data \u2014 which were drawn from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey as well as the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey \u2014 is that Kronick adjusted it for a number of demographic and health factors, such as status as a smoker and body mass index. When he did that, \"\"the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance.\"\" In other words, once you compare death rates in an apples-to-apples fashion \u2014 comparing insured smokers to uninsured smokers, for instance \u2014 the likelihood of dying evens out. This, in turn, would mean that IOM's estimate of 18,000 deaths would drop essentially to zero. In his paper, Kronick acknowledges that this is a \"\"counterintuitive\"\" result, possibly resulting from the safety net of public hospitals and community clinics providing \"\"'good enough' access to care for the uninsured to keep their mortality rate similar to that of the insured.\"\" Either way, he writes, \"\"there would not be much change in the number of deaths in the United States as a result of universal coverage, although the difficulties of inferring causality from observational analyses temper the strength of this conclusion.\"\" We ran Kronick's paper by a number of health care policy experts to see whether they thought it undercut the Institute of Medicine's death estimate. Everyone agreed that both Kronick personally and the journal that published him are credible. Because the significance of his finding could also have political consequences \u2014 on June 24, for instance, John Goodman, president of the conservative National Center for Policy Analysis, testified to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health that we \"\"do not know how much morbidity and mortality is attributable to lack of health insurance\"\" \u2014 we also wanted to determine whether there may be any ideological bias at work. But we found no evidence of it. In fact, far from having ties to the conservative movement, Kronick served as a senior health care policy adviser in the Clinton administration, where, according to his biography, he contributed to the development of the Clinton health care reform proposal. Kronick's articles have appeared in the  New England Journal of Medicine  and the  Journal of the American Medical Association  , and his work has at times been funded by the Commonwealth Fund, whose mission is \"\"to promote a high-performing health care system\"\" that aids \"\"society's most vulnerable,\"\" including \"\"the uninsured.\"\" Kronick even told PolitiFact that his finding was \"\"not the answer I wanted\"\" and, as a result, he agonized over whether to publish it or not. He said he's \"\"grateful\"\" that it has so far been unnoticed in the increasingly hostile debate over health care. \"\"I don't have a whole lot of friends, and will probably lose a few over this,\"\" he told us. \"\"And I might make some friends I didn't want.\"\" But a number of experts we spoke to are glad that Kronick did publish it. Henry Aaron, a health policy specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that he was impressed by Kronick's research from the time Kronick presented an early draft of it at a Brookings lunch seminar. \"\"I found his reasoning compelling,\"\" said Aaron, himself a member of the Institute of Medicine. \"\"In fact, after listening to his presentation, I had a hard time believing that the IOM had done what they had done.\"\" In interviews, Aaron and other health care scholars agreed with Kronick that uninsured and insured Americans differ in many ways other than their insurance status. \"\"To estimate the impact of the lack of insurance on mortality rates, one has to control statistically for all of those differences,\"\" Aaron said. That, he added, is exactly what Kronick has sought to do so. Robert Book, a senior research fellow in health economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, agrees with Aaron. \"\"I would be more inclined to believe Kronick's than other studies,\"\" he said, \"\"I'm just surprised the IOM did their study without controlling for other factors.\"\" Book also praised Kronick\u2019s decision to run calculations with numerous alternative models, and to remove various factors, one at a time, from the calculations. \"\"From the standpoint of a careful econometric study, Kronick\u2019s paper is excellent,\"\" Book said. \"\"I\u2019ve seen few papers that are this thorough in terms of seeking alternate explanations for their conclusions.\"\" Other health policy specialists we talked to were open to the idea of Kronick being right, while urging caution before overruling the Institute of Medicine estimate. Dorn, the Urban Institute researcher, pointed to a second study published by the Institute of Medicine on Feb. 24, 2009. This 268-page volume, America's Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care, provides a detailed analysis of subsequent studies on the topic. While it didn\u2019t provide a new estimate of extra deaths from uninsurance, the new Institute of Medicine study concluded that \"\"the body of evidence on the health consequences of health insurance is stronger than ever before.\"\" Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund and an Institute of Medicine member, said that the existence of Kronick's study \"\"doesn't convince me yet not to use the IOM study,\"\" but she added that \"\"if I saw a few more, I might be convinced. I tend to believe things when I see multiple studies using different databases and methodologies come to the same conclusion.\"\" (Aaron said he agreed with Davis on this point.) For the record, an IOM spokeswoman said the institute has not assessed Kronick's paper and thus had no comment on its assertions. On one key point, the Institute of Medicine and Kronick actually aren't that far apart. Kronick said he doesn't doubt that individuals' health suffers when they're uninsured \u2014 he just hasn't found evidence that they die sooner. \"\"No one would choose not to have insurance if they could afford it,\"\" Kronick said. \"\"There's no benefit to having 47 million Americans uninsured.\"\" When we asked Pascrell\u2019s office whether the Kronick study would change their view, spokesman Paul Brubaker said it would not. \"\"The point of the congressman\u2019s statistic is to show a direct correlation between one\u2019s ability to pay and the ability to have insurance, and therefore on their ability to be healthy,\u201d Brubaker said. But for us, Kronick\u2019s study raises questions about the reliability of the Institute of Medicine\u2019s death estimate. We acknowledge that there is not yet a consensus among the experts. But in re-evaluating Pascrell's claim, we can no longer rate it True. We recognize that the Institute of Medicine is still widely respected, but an ideologically diverse group of experts is giving credence to Kronick's findings. That leaves us with something of a split decision, and so we downgrade our rating to .\"n\nClaim: As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don\u2019t have health insurance.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim is based on a study updated by Stan Dorn, using the Institute of Medicine's methodology, which initially estimated 18,000 deaths, later updated to 22,000 due to lack of health insurance.

Perhaps what is most missing from this \u201cjust-the-facts ma\u2019am\u201d article on the USPSTF\u2019s recommendations is the larger sense of context: major statin trials have all been funded by statin manufacturers where we know that adverse event information is incomplete and sometimes hidden, benefits are typically exaggerated as they are expressed in relative risk reductions, and that most people, physicians and patients included, will likely overestimate the benefit they might derive from statin therapy. Above all, the medicalizing of cholesterol levels in otherwise healthy people is considered by some to be\u00a0among the biggest current scandals in medicine. Having said that, it was good to see this article tipping\u00a0the hat toward those who have put forward very strong arguments against the measuring and altering of our blood cholesterols, mentioning the questionable chance of benefit and the many potential harms. It also was good to see that the article noted that there were at least two sides to this issue and that \u201cIndividual\u00a0doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.\u201d \u00a0 Because this recommendation affects millions of Americans, how well it is understood, especially around the potential magnitude of benefit and potential for harm from long-term statin treatment, has huge implications for the health of the population.

However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now.

And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery.

So while the mid-afternoon article indicated that Deaconess still needed mask-making volunteers, the health system advised volunteers immediately thereafter to consider donating excess masks to other organizations.A concurrently circulating\u00a0Wired\u00a0interview with pandemic expert and epidemiologist Larry Brilliant included a brief exchange about masks and N95 respirators. The author asked if everyone ought to be wearing masks (the public has been repeatedly advised to refrain from further taxing supplies needed by hospitals), and Brilliant explained why that particular piece of equipment was vital in clinical settings during the coronavirus pandemic:The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful. The pores in the mask are three microns wide. The virus is one micron wide. So you get people who say, well, it\u2019s not going to work. But you try having three big, huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime\u2014they\u2019re not going to get through. In the latest data I saw, the mask provided 5x protection. That\u2019s really good. But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe. So masks should go where they\u2019re needed the most: in taking care of patients.As noted by Scott, CDC guidelines did allow for alternatives to N95s in the absence of PPE \u2014 but only as a port of last resort. On a page\u00a0(\u201cInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\u201d) last updated on March 19 2020, the CDC acknowledged a gap in available N95s and added:In times of shortages, alternatives to N95s should be considered, including other classes of FFRs, elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece air purifying respirators, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. Special care should be taken to ensure that respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, measles, varicella).The anticipated timeline for return to routine levels of PPE is not yet known. Information about strategies to optimize the current supply of N95 respirators, including the use of devices that provide higher levels of respiratory protection (e.g., powered air purifying respirators [PAPRs]) when N95s are in limited supply and a companion checklist to help healthcare facilities prioritize the implementation of the strategies, is available.In a final section titled \u201cSummary of Changes to the Guidance,\u201d CDC guidelines included reports about a lack of PPE in clinical settings:Updated information in the background is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and the current situation in the United States, which includes reports of cases of community transmission, infections identified in healthcare personnel (HCP), and shortages of facemasks, N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) (commonly known as N95 respirators), and gowns.The CDC also maintained COVID-19 specific guidance on \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE,\u201d with a subsection headlined, \u201cStrategies for Optimizing the Supply of Facemasks.\u201d A final section was titled \u201cWhen No Facemasks Are Available, Options Include,\u201d and it explained:[Health Care Professional] use of homemade masks: In settings where facemasks are not available, [health care professionals, or] HCP might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort. However, homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect HCP is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option. Homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.That excerpt explained:Additional guidance\u00a0explained:This document offers a series of strategies or options to optimize supplies of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly called \u201cN95 respirators\u201d) in healthcare settings when there is limited supply. It does not address other aspects of pandemic planning; for those, healthcare settings can refer to existing influenza preparedness plans to address other aspects of preparing to respond to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The strategies are also listed in order of priority and preference in the Checklist for Healthcare Facilities: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators during the COVID-19 Response in an easy-to-use format for healthcare facilities.During the week ending March 20 2020, Providence.org and Deaconess Health Systems put out a call for volunteers to make homemade masks due to national shortages of surgical masks and N95s. Discourse included some concern from health care professionals about CDC guidelines based on availability rather science. The appeals for homemade masks were legitimate, as were the concerns.CDC guidelines maintained that when all PPE courses of action were exhausted, handmade or homemade masks could be used to protect doctors and nurses for whom no N95 masks were available. However, the CDC also emphasized that such an approach was acceptable only when absolutely necessary.","sources":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/blog.providence.org\/coronavirus\/volunteers-making-homemade-masks-to-combat-shortages-caused-by-covid-19, https:\/\/www.providence.org\/lp\/100m-masks, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control\/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/infection-control\/control-recommendations.html, https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/posts\/2880486841997611, https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/coronavirus-interview-larry-brilliant-smallpox-epidemiologist\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=%27100+Million+Masks%27+--+Are+Homemade+Masks+Sufficient+for+COVID-19+First+Responders%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/face-masks.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/respirators-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/hcp\/ppe-strategy\/index.html, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/rapunzel-was-quarantined-in-tangled-google-the-name-of-her-kingdom\/, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/18\/coronavirus-deaconess-ask-public-provide-medical-face-masks\/2865273001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MaryNamKOMO\/, https:\/\/www.courierpress.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/20\/coronvavirus-whole-world-responding-deaconess-face-masks-plea\/2884671001\/, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/medical-devices\/letters-health-care-providers\/surgical-mask-and-gown-conservation-strategies-letter-healthcare-providers, https:\/\/washington.providence.org\/about, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2F100-million-masks-are-homemade-masks-sufficient-for-covid-19-first-responders%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/natural-news-cdc-coronavirus\/, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DeaconessHealthSystem\/posts\/10156622869747273?__cft__[0]=AZWNrouqxgFJbXaeggpz4E2RA8iOBJtkFvtemEZn4bq-hM2QI5K2E1IGUqrrCs9LhNGBN4mRzgLOh-OIyGFpI5jhdP3Xhm_rsPbfe4vOnKuYENNBdpfy3BUEB_8nnGrPF_gd1XN4qgLtXa8KhvV2sujUIxfHi1WLv3VEwkav9wASkA&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":1012,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nOn March 20 2020, KOMO anchor Mary Nam shared a photograph of a person wearing a surgical mask (a form of personal protective equipment, or PPE, known to be in short supply due the coronavirus pandemic), and put out a call for anyone who knows how to sew and has access to a sewing machine to participate in an effort to fortify COVID-19 medical supplies with homemade surgical masks:Know how to sew?

The mask design was lab tested to ensure safety and effectiveness. **The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintained a page, \u201cN95 Respirators and Surgical Masks (Face Masks),\u201d defining the terms used during discussions of PPE shortages; linked on that page was a March 11 2020 letter from the FDA about coping with PPE shortages in a clinical environment:N95 respirators and surgical masks (face masks) are examples of personal protective equipment that are used to protect the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also regulate N95 respirators. [\u2026]The \u2018N95\u2019 designation means that when subjected to careful testing, the respirator blocks at least 95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. If properly fitted, the filtration capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of face masks. However, even a properly fitted N95 respirator does not completely eliminate the risk of illness or death.Comments on Nam\u2019s Facebook post were often left by people who met the stated requirements of knowing how to sew and having access to a sewing machine. However, a self-identified nurse from a Seattle hospital (a city where many of the United States\u2019 earliest cases occurred) politely expressed some concerns about the 100 million masks initiative:As a RN at Swedish, I am extremely skeptical of the efficacy of masks that are sewn. Are these CDC approved?! Seems to me that the CDC keeps downgrading the necessary PPE based on availability and not science. We healthcare workers put our health (and our family\u2019s health) at risk every day now. We deserve the best equipment.Jeffries explained that it was her experience that standards for protective equipment were relaxed due to a dearth of supplies \u2014 not the parameters of SARS-nCoV-2 safety protocols in a clinical setting.A second commenter did not claim to be a medical professional, but questioned the safety of the program in general, citing concerns about sterility and donations from volunteers possibly exposed to SARS-nCoV-2 themselves:Do all the masks go thru a sterile process before their used?? I\u2019m so confused \u2026cross contamination from many homes going into medical and health facilities\u2026 I\u2019m a Teacher and when parents offered to drop off work at the school every week I about flipped out inside\u2026if your kids cant be here in person, your willing to pack up their germs in a bag and send them back to the school\u2026 Can someone please explain to me how everything is not being cross contaminated? Including the school lunches they are delivering?? Doesnt the virus live on things for a period of time? Be nice\u2026I\u2019m just looking for information not a lashingThat commenter noted that as described, the program would entail raw materials distributed to \u201cmany homes,\u201d then collected and distributed to health facilities without any sterilizing measures described. Two comments down, the exact concern the commenter raised seemed to be illustrated:I\u2019m in Wenatchee WA, I believe I\u2019ve been exposed but not exhibiting symptoms. A family member in this household is suspected of having the virus. I would welcome the chance to help if it is safe.We clicked on the link shared by Nam, and it led to a page\u00a0with the same graphic seen in the Facebook post:Under \u201c100 Million Mask Challenge\u201d and \u201cthe journey begins with us \u2026 learn how to get involved,\u201d the page explained global demand for PPE led to a shortage of \u201cmasks\u201d:Let\u2019s come together to keep our health care workers safe, so they can safely care for our patients.The global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) has created a severe shortage of PPE across the world. While regular distribution channels ramp up, we need to act now to ensure caregivers have the isolation masks they need to do their jobs safely.So, we\u2019re calling on you! Anyone with a willing heart and the ability to sew can help us protect our caregivers by sewing masks they can wear on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19.We are starting with Western Washington, which is one of the hardest hit areas in the nation. The effort will grow from there over the coming days and weeks so eventually everyone can participate.Please note: Volunteers must have the ability to sew and a sewing machine at home.A subsequent portion explained that all willing participants were asked to commit to sewing 100 masks. An initial date of March 23 2020 was provided for volunteers to collect the materials being distributed:Here\u2019s how it will work. Since materials are precious and large quantities are required to make a difference, we\u2019re seeking volunteers willing to make at least 100 masks. If you know how to sew, have a sewing machine, and are up for that challenge, here\u2019s how you can help:Pick up a kit that will include all the materials you need to make 100 masks. We\u2019ll offer various pick-up and drop-off times and locations. The first date and location for picking up a kit is [listed. ]Be sure to check back for future kit distribution dates and locations as we will be updating regularly.A contact form providing the organizers of the 100 Million Mask Challenge with information for volunteers followed; filling out the form did not lead to any additional information on the kits\u2019 contents or parameters.Organizing the 100 Million Mask Challenge appeared to be\u00a0Providence.org, described on the site\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d page as \u201cthe largest health care provider in Washington state\u201d:Providence Health & Services is the largest health care provider in Washington state. Our not-for-profit network includes hospitals, physicians, clinics, care centers, hospice and home health programs and diverse community services across Washington. It also features a unique affiliation with Swedish Health Services in Western Washington.With more than 35 hospitals and various health and living facilities and 20,000 employees statewide, our health and services organizations work together to provide quality care to those in need. We continue to honor and live by a commitment to compassionate service that the Sisters of Providence began more than 155 years ago. Washington is part of our five-state network, which also serves Alaska, Oregon, Montana and California.On March 18 2020, a very brief post to Providence.org\u2019s blog\u00a0(\u201c100 Million Mask Challenge: Volunteers Making Masks to Combat Shortage\u201d) announced the initiation of the homemade mask effort. The post said Providence was \u201ctaking matters into its own hands\u201d due to a \u201cmassive national shortage\u201d of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic.In that post, the organization said that Providence\u2019s infection control was creating \u201cface shields\u201d with materials they already had on hand \u2014 \u201cmarine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic,\u201d not sewing masks from fabric:Facing a massive national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) to fight COVID-19, Providence is taking matters into its own hands by making their own protective gear out of what they have on hand.To buy time as cases grow, Providence infection control is creating face shields with materials from their shelves \u2013 marine-grade vinyl, industrial tape, foam and elastic. Earlier this week they visited hardware stores to get materials, and volunteers came together to start making the masks.\u201cWe are very close to being out of face shields,\u201d said Becca Bartles, executive director of infection prevention at Providence. \u201cMasks, we\u2019re probably a couple of days away.\u201dOn the same day Providence.org published their blog post, the\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported that similar efforts were being organized by Deaconess Health System in Illinois:Citing shortages, Deaconess Health System, including Henderson\u2019s Methodist Health, has asked the public to sew face masks for staff fighting coronavirus.\u201cThis does follow CDC protocols that you can find on their website that if all other supplies are not available, that handmade masks that meet certain criteria are acceptable,\u201d Deaconess spokeswoman Becca Scott said.The release with the video, pattern and instructions was posted to the Deaconess Facebook page [on March 19 2020] and is available at www.deaconess.com\/masks. A PDF of the pattern is available here and embedded at the bottom of this article.Deaconess has \u201ca sample video\u201d about how to make the masks, which Scott said will be sterilized when they come in.\u201cThis is not outside CDC guidelines if other supplies are exhausted. And so we want to have these coming in,\u201d Scott said.Shortages of specialized masks moved federal health officials this month to liberalize their recommendations about which face protection front line health-care workers should use to ward off the highly contagious disease stemming from coronavirus.In that reporting, Deaconess Health System spokeswoman Becca Scott provided some additional context for that project:Scott reiterated that handmade masks for healthcare workers were acceptable under said guidelines if all \u201cother supplies are exhausted,\u201d a stipulation which echoed the concerns in the Seattle nurse\u2019s Facebook comment. As she observed, it appeared a massive shortage of masks and N95 respiratiors did indeed cause the CDC to loosen regulations on acceptable forms of PPE.That article also included instructions provided by Deaconess Health Systems for handmade masks, as well as information about any surplus of donated homemade masks:\u2022 Use tightly-woven cotton fabric. \u2022 Please remember that both women and men in a variety of roles may wear these masks. \u2022 When your masks are complete, please call 812-450-8673 to arrange delivery. (You will be met in a facility parking lot at a pre-arranged time.) \u2022 Collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry\/processing to be prepared for use. \u2022 Any surplus masks will be distributed to other organizations in need.In contrast to Providence\u2019s organized pick-up date and time, Deaconess Health Systems arranged individual deliveries, likely to reduce contact between mask-makers. Instructions in the article were published to\u00a0deaconess.com\/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask.At the top of the original page in big red text was a message indicating that Deaconess Health Systems no longer required volunteers thanks to a broad and enthusiastic response to their original request:Update: We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and kindness from our community, the country and the world. We now have plenty of masks coming our way. Please consider reaching out to a hospital, nursing home, cancer-related organization, etc. near you, as many other health care facilities are also experiencing shortages in masks.On Facebook, a post published to the Deaconess Health Systems\u2019 page at 9:39 AM on March 19 2020 originally read:We are welcoming fabric masks from our community as we prepare for COVID-19. Learn more at\u00a0www.deaconess.com\/masks.A follow-up article by\u00a0Evansville Courier & Press\u00a0reported an overwhelming response to the Facebook post and plea:In an unusual time, Deaconess Health Systems made an unusual plea.Like every hospital in the world right now, Deaconess is worried it could run out of supplies if a rush of COVID-19 patients overwhelms its facilities.So it asked for the public\u2019s help: grab your sewing machine, make some masks at home and deliver them to the hospital.There\u2019s no way they could have imagined the response they received.\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you what the outpouring has been on that,\u201d spokeswoman Pam Hight said Friday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.
