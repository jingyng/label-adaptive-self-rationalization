He will be (Mr.) Bloggs. And his rehabilitation will only be effective if he comes to terms with being Bloggs - and fulfils what Bloggs can do,\u201d said Richard Greenwood, a consultant neurologist at London\u2019s Homerton Hospital and at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very difficult process to take people through - and many people don\u2019t achieve it.\u201d  Greenwood was speaking at a briefing for reporters on the results of a study into the long-term effects of traumatic brain injuries caused by blows to the head. The study, published on Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, found that survivors of TBIs are three times more likely to die prematurely than the general population, often from suicide or fatal accidents. Seena Fazel of Oxford University\u2019s Department of Psychiatry, who led the study, said the exact reasons for the increased risk of premature death - which in this study was defined as dying before the age of 56 - are not clear. But he said they may be linked to damage to parts of the brain responsible for judgment, decision-making and risk-taking. TBI survivors are three times more likely to die from fatal injuries that may be a due to impaired judgment or reactions. They are also at increased risk of developing psychiatric illnesses such as depression and anxiety, which can lead to patients having difficulties dealing with new situations and organizing their lives. A TBI is a blow to the head that leads to a skull fracture, internal bleeding, loss of consciousness for longer than an hour or a combination of these symptoms. Some 1.7 million people in the United States and one million people in Europe are hospitalized after TBIs each year. Experts say typical causes include road accidents, falls and sports injuries, and Schumacher\u2019s skiing injury - sustained when he slammed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in the French Alps - is a an example of this type of injury.

The results were based on a study in the Morbidity and Mortality report, the agency\u2019s weekly report on death and disease. According to the report, more than 9,000 children age 12 and younger died in a car crash from 2002 to 2011. \u201cThe good news is motor vehicle deaths decreased by 43 percent over the past decade for children age 12 and younger. The tragic news is still with that decrease, more than 9,000 kids were killed on the road in this period,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference. \u201cThousands of children are at risk on the road because they are not buckled up,\u201d he said. The study found that of the children who died between 2009 to 2010, a much higher proportion of black and Hispanic children were not buckled, compared with white kids. \u201cThe difference was nearly half (45 percent for blacks and 46 percent for Hispanics) versus a quarter (26 percent) for white kids,\u201d Frieden said. The study did not investigate why racial differences played such a big role in seat belt use, but it did suggest socio-economic factors may play a role. For the study, CDC researchers analyzed data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find the number of deaths among occupants in cars from 2002 to 2011 for all children aged up to the age of 12. Overall, 9,182 children died in car crashes during the period. But deaths dropped sharply, from 2.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002, to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2011, a 43 percent decline. According to the report, seat belt use increased from 88 percent in 2002 to 91 percent in 2011 among all children age 7 and under. The study also confirmed earlier findings that older children are less likely to be wearing seat belts than younger children. To prevent future deaths from car crashes, Frieden said parents should make sure their children use appropriate-sized car seats, booster seats and seat belts on every trip. The CDC recommends that children from birth to age 2 should be in a rear-facing car seat. Starting at age 2, children should be in a forward-facing car seat until at least age 5, or when they reach the upper weight or height limit of that seat. Children age 5 and older should use a booster seat until the adult seat belt fits them properly, generally when the lap belt lays across the upper thighs and the shoulder belt slays across the chest, but not the neck.

Needless to say, it was shocking.Several members of our team asked the customer to remove it, and all requests were ignored until the customer was in the checkout area. This was a disturbing incident for our associates and customers, and we are reviewing with our team how to best handle such inappropriate situations in the future.A second man, identified as Dustin Hart, posted video online of himself shopping in a Food 4 Less store in the same community wearing a mask bearing the Nazi swastika symbol on May 7, 2020. Hart has claimed that he wore the symbol to \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d stay-at-home measures implemented by Gov. Gavin Newsom. He refused to remove the mask when asked about it by both authorities and store personnel. The Sheriff\u2019s Department is also investigating that incident.During its meeting on May 13, 2020 the city council voted to address the two incidents by allowing Minto to nominate more people to a separate group, the Community Oriented Policing Committee (COMPOP).

Standing quietly,\u201d one woman told the Times of San Diego. \u201cA man in a wheelchair [went] past and saluted him and he laughed. I took the photo because I couldn\u2019t believe what I was witnessing. I\u2019ve grown up in Santee and have never seen such racism right before my eyes.\u201dThe San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement at the time that it had \u201cbeen made aware\u201d of the incident but that deputies were not called to the store while the man was there.\u201cDetectives from the Sheriff\u2019s Department are looking into the matter and will pursue any appropriate criminal charges,\u201d the department said. \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department does not condone hate or any acts of intolerance in our communities. We are a county that is welcoming of people from all backgrounds.\u201dAccording to the San Diego Union-Tribune, though, the department later said that it would not pursue charges against the man citing \u201cinsufficient evidence.\u201dLocated in the eastern part of San Diego County, Santee has been derisively nicknamed \u201cKlantee\u201d by other San Diego residents. At least eight white supremacist groups are reportedly still active in the San Diego area, and local white nationalist figure Roger Ogden was identified as the organizer of an event protesting measures seeking to limit the spread of COVID-19 using \u201cfreedom\u201d as a pretext. The demonstrations, largely organized via Facebook, have largely attracted white nationalist groups, who have taken the opportunity to spread anti-Semitic and\u00a0Nazi-related rhetoric.Mayor John Minto released a joint statement with the Santee City Council condemning the unidentified Vons shopper\u2019s behavior.\u201cMany thanks to all who stepped forward to curtail this sad reminder of intolerance,\u201d the statement read. \u201cSantee, its leaders, and I will not tolerate such behavior. Santee and its citizens are great, and this particular individual\u2019s actions are not representative of us as a people and a wonderful city.\u201dAlbertsons, the parent company for the Vons chain, also released a statement:At Vons, fostering an environment of courtesy, dignity and respect is one of our highest priorities, and we work hard to hold everyone in our stores to these standards, including customers.Unfortunately, an alarming and isolated incident occurred at our Vons store in Santee, where a customer chose an inflammatory method of wearing a face covering. Needless to say, it was shocking.Several members of our team asked the customer to remove it, and all requests were ignored until the customer was in the checkout area. This was a disturbing incident for our associates and customers, and we are reviewing with our team how to best handle such inappropriate situations in the future.A second man, identified as Dustin Hart, posted video online of himself shopping in a Food 4 Less store in the same community wearing a mask bearing the Nazi swastika symbol on May 7, 2020. Hart has claimed that he wore the symbol to \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d stay-at-home measures implemented by Gov. Gavin Newsom. He refused to remove the mask when asked about it by both authorities and store personnel. The Sheriff\u2019s Department is also investigating that incident.During its meeting on May 13, 2020 the city council voted to address the two incidents by allowing Minto to nominate more people to a separate group, the Community Oriented Policing Committee (COMPOP). The mayor said he planned to nominate at least one Black member as well as a member of the ADL.

{"claim_id":9779,"hypothesis":"Bacteria From Mother May Colonize Cesarean Births","date_published":"February 5, 2016","explanation_1":"This is a well-articulated but incomplete story about a proof-of-principle study suggesting that when babies born by C-section are swabbed with their mother\u2019s vaginal fluids, they have a microbiome more closely approximating\u00a0those of their vaginally-born peers up to a month after birth. The article does a nice job of explaining the science and placing the evidence in context, but we think that it missed the mark on the potential harms of the intervention. This is a significant omission. Emerging research suggests that the types and patterns\u00a0of natural bacteria growing on our bodies are important for healthy immune, digestive, and metabolic systems. Babies born by C-section do not have the benefit of being colonized by the natural\u00a0bacteria in their mothers\u2019 vaginal tracts, so an alternative method for inoculating babies with these bacteria (and an inexpensive, easy-to-implement one, at that) may even the playing field for C-section babies.","fact_checkers":"Ishani Ganguli, MD, MPH,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kevin Lomangino","premise":"The article does not discuss the costs associated with inoculation. However, it\u2019s implied that vaginal microbial transfer is very inexpensive (it only requires a piece of gauze, saline, and a sterile bottle \u2013 all standard hospital supplies) so we won\u2019t ding the story for this omission. With that being said, there is a tacit assumption in the article that the transfer of bacteria from the mother\u2019s vaginal fluids to the newborn is always in the best interest of the newborn. Clearly this is not the case as we will articulate later. If there is a risk of the transfer of less than desirable bacteria, it is reasonable to assume that bacterial screening of vaginal secretions might be undertaken (which would add cost). The transfer of pathogens to the newborn inducing infection would also have a cost. While it is beyond the scope of this report, we think that thinking about the potential downsides of a new intervention is in order. The article does a nice job of detailing the potential benefits of the microbial transfer and the results seen in the study, while giving the caveat that longer follow up studies are needed to understand the implications of various microbiome make-ups. But to be fair, the results are from a total of 4 newborns, hardly a number on which to base any strong conclusions. The story says that thus far the procedure \u201chas proved entirely safe,\u201d but we\u2019re talking about only four babies here! The article assumes that all the bacteria in the mother\u2019s vaginal secretions are \u201cfriendly.\u201d \u00a0This is clearly not the case in all patients. Significant infections can be transmitted to the newborn from bacteria resident in the mothers vaginal secretions from less than friendly bacteria\u00a0including Chlamydia, Listeria and group B Strep to name a few. Suggesting that the procedure is not recommended but then pointing out that Dr. Brubaker had the procedure done for her newborn supports the notion that this is a harmless procedure \u2014 a potentially dangerous message. The story describes the study as small and proof-of-principle, although it arguably should have made more out of the fact that only four babies underwent the swabbing procedure. That\u2019s a very small number. Nevertheless, we think the story injects enough caution to earn a Satisfactory rating. We liked that it spelled out the next phase of study to provide readers with a realistic sense of the scientific process. This article appropriately addresses the issue of increasing C-section use in U.S. and its potential repercussions. The article quotes several outside sources with the comments of Drs.

{"claim_id":27582,"hypothesis":"The United States is deporting military veterans.","date_published":"February 8, 2016","explanation_1":"Honorably-discharged veterans of the U.S. military have, under certain circumstances, either received deportation orders or been deported.","fact_checkers":"Brooke Binkowski","premise":"Immigration is a sensitive and touchy issue, and never more so than in the United States during an election year. Thus, when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the U.S. military living in Mexico after they had been\u00a0deported from the United States (a story we\u00a0previously reported on) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite. However, deported veterans exist, although no one \u2014 not even the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 knows how many. Their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream American consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in Tijuana. \u201cThe Bunker,\u201d also known as the Deported Veterans Support House, is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in Mexico\u2019s border town of Tijuana, and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the United States military, who fought everywhere from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Former Army paratrooper Hector Barajas, 39, opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who, like him, had been deported: \u201cI started The Bunker because there was a need,\u201d Barajas told us. He said since his deportation, he had been meeting others like him living in Tijuana, and discovered that they lived throughout Mexico\u00a0\u2014 but not just Mexico. There are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries, he said. Since then, The Bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause: Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home. We shouldn\u2019t honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for. It may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the United States military does not automatically confer citizenship, but it doesn\u2019t. It can smooth\u00a0the way, provided the aspiring\u00a0citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe. However, it\u2019s not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume (having never been told otherwise) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship, and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait. Sometimes, too, there are bureaucratic foulups. One man was deported after\u00a0he was unable to attend a hearing, despite his reason: he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time. Others do everything the way they\u2019re supposed to, filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings, but still get deported, and no one seems to know\u00a0exactly why. Once they are outside the U.S., they maintain a\u00a0legal right to VA benefits such as healthcare, and to whatever funds they might be entitled, but they have no way of getting back into the United States to obtain that assistance, and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them. Because these particular veterans are either in the United States on green cards or without documentation after their discharges, they can be deported with cause, or for no reason at all. Past and present members of the armed forces\u00a0are supposed to receive special consideration\u00a0during deportation hearings, but the\u00a0guidelines are inconsistently applied. However, some\u00a0of these veterans have\u00a0spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses, which makes their situation more difficult to parse, at least politically. Elected officials (and\u00a0candidates) who might ordinarily be in full-throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers. Sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the American flag\u00a0suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before. Miguel Perez, a United States Army veteran, falls under that category. The 39-year-old Illinois man, who served two tours in Afghanistan and who has been in the U.S. since he was eight, was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008. The green card holder had served half of a 15-year prison sentence when Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement took him for deportation proceedings. After losing an appeal, Perez was deported in March 2018: Perez was flown from Gary, Indiana, to Brownsville, Texas, where officers escorted him across the border and turned him over to Mexican authorities, ICE officials said. Perez appeared shocked by his treatment during his final moments on U.S. soil. An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would \u201cfix this\u201d while leading him to a gate, Perez said. \u201cWhen we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done here,'\u201d he said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally? This is it?\u201d The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to\u00a0return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don\u2019t apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes. It would also prevent the removal of military veterans from the U.S. in the future. On 13 April 2018, Hector Barajas, the deported veteran who was one of the first to shine a spotlight on their plight, received his American citizenship, potentially paving the way for hundreds of other former United States military members:","sources":" ","label":0,"subjects":"Politics Immigration, deported veteran, immigration, mexico","__index_level_0__":8265,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nImmigration is a sensitive and touchy issue, and never more so than in the United States during an election year.

An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would \u201cfix this\u201d while leading him to a gate, Perez said. \u201cWhen we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re done here,'\u201d he said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help. '\u201d Perez recalls thinking, \u201cReally? This is it?\u201d The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to\u00a0return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don\u2019t apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes. It would also prevent the removal of military veterans from the U.S. in the future. On 13 April 2018, Hector Barajas, the deported veteran who was one of the first to shine a spotlight on their plight, received his American citizenship, potentially paving the way for hundreds of other former United States military members:n\nClaim: The United States is deporting military veterans.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"entailment","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence provided explicitly confirms that military veterans who are non-citizens have been deported from the United States. Instances such as the story of Hector Barajas and Miguel Perez, among others, clearly illustrate that veterans who served in the U.S. military but did not secure U.S. citizenship were subjected to deportation. Additionally, the establishment of 'The Bunker' or the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana further substantiates the claim, as it serves as a refuge for deported U.S. military veterans. Therefore, the claim that the United States is deporting military veterans is true based on the provided evidence."}

{"claim_id":10658,"hypothesis":"Shingles Vaccine Cuts Disease Risk 55%","date_published":"January 11, 2011","explanation_1":"This story about how the shingles vaccine performs in the real world takes a somewhat different tack from the HealthDay and Reuters stories we also reviewed. It includes discussion of a second study documenting low usage rates of the vaccine, but the story fails to give readers any comments from experts (like those quoted in the HealthDay story) who explain why some people have put a lower priority on the shingles vaccine. The story covers many of the basic points on the effectiveness study, though readers are not told what is new and different about this study compared to earlier research. There is a good description of who was included in this study, but little attention to the potential sources of bias inherent in this sort of observational study. In addition to reporting the 55 percent reduction in relative risk and the absolute risk reduction (6 versus 13 cases per 1,000 people per year), we wish this story had noted that the study found that 71 people need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one from having a shingles attack. When this story discusses the study documenting low usage rates, it states that \u201cdoctors may not be aware of the new recommendation.\u201d It could be argued that many doctors have been aware of the recommendations, but have had a healthy skepticism of the original study, and did not yet have the results of this current study, which is at least a start at getting information on the generalizability of the original study\u2019s results. Many doctors may be cautious about immediately jumping on the bandwagon of a new vaccine. If patients are healthy, the onus is on the physician to provide more good than harm, especially in prevention. Finally, the story is unbalanced when it ends with this comment without challenging it:\u00a0 \u201cOnce the patients learn about it, most are agreeable\u2026\u201dEverybody wants it\u2026\u201d Our medical editor who reviewe this story believes that many patients are cautious and\/or skeptical of new vaccines (or any vaccines, for that matter), especially when the condition is shingles, and many patients do not think of the condition with \u201chorror stories\u201d but rather something usually self-limiting and also treatable.","fact_checkers":" ","premise":"This story includes a comment that \u201cvaccine expense is another barrier for some\u201d and that not all insurance plans cover the cost of this vaccine, but readers are not told that it can cost about $200. Nonetheless, we\u2019ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion since cost and insurance are at least addressed. Although this story leads with only the relative risk reduction of 55 percent that researchers found in this study, it quickly places that effect in context with that of other vaccines (which generally provide greater protection). The story also reports the absolute risk figures of 6.4 cases per 1,000 people per year among those vaccinated and 13 cases per 1,000 people per year among those who were not vaccinated. These numbers help readers put the effects into the overall context of the risk of shingles. We think readers would have benefitted from also being told that based on the results of this study, one case of shingles is prevented for every 71 people vaccinated. This figure makes clear that while some people who are vaccinated are spared from a shingles attack, not everyone should expect to personally benefit from vaccination. The story should have pointed out  that the study looked at a limited time span and that the researchers can\u2019t say whether the effects of the vaccine persist through later years. That\u2019s an important caveat, since a 60-year-old who had chicken pox as a child is at risk for a shingles attack for the remaining decades of life. If the vaccine cuts the risk of attacks in half, but only for the first few years after vaccination, then the lifetime reduction in risk would be much smaller. The story reports that earlier research identified side effects of the vaccine, including redness and pain at the injection site. But an inquiring story would have asked about side effects in the new study. Although this story did a better job than the other stories we reviewed in describing the participants of this study as members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan in southern California, like the other stories, it failed to address the potential sources of bias inherent in this sort of observational study. The study authors highlighted the limitations of the study design and explained what they did to try to identify and adjust for bias. The story should have given readers more information on these study limitations. The story reports that this vaccine is recommended for people 60 and older. It also includes a comment about who should not get the vaccine, \u201cincluding people with a compromised immune system and certain cancers.\u201d Our medical editor on this story thought there was an element of disease-mongering in how the story didn\u2019t emphasize that it is post-herpetic neuralgia that \u201ccan last months or even years\u201d and by not then emphasizing immediately that most people with zoster do not have this condition. But we\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. The story includes an independent source. However, the comments of the independent source don\u2019t address the specific methods or findings of this study. Instead, they begin to wander off into a discussion of the relationship between stress and shingles attacks. The story does tell readers that this study was funded by the Kaiser Permanente health plan and that the lead author has received support from the vaccine\u2019s maker for other research. As this story points out, less than 7 percent of people age 60 or older have gotten the shingles vaccine (while many more in that group have gotten flu, pneumonia and other vaccinations). The story should have addressed the reasons that so many primary care physicians and their older patients have decided that deferring vaccination against shingles is a reasonable option. The shared decision-making option of NOT\u00a0being vaccinated was not given a forum here. Instead, the line:\u00a0 \u201cOnce patients learn about it, most are agreeable. \u201cEverybody wants it, because they have heard all the horror stories,\u201d (said UCLA\u2019s Dr. Galler. )\u201d The story reports that this shingles vaccine has been available in the Untied States since 2006.

The story unfolded when bystander video emerged of Clinton nearly fainting and stumbling from a curb before her aids loaded her into a van after a 9\/11 event in New York. The situation played into conspiracy theories that Clinton has been hiding a major medical condition, most likely Parkinson\u2019s disease. Clinton\u2019s doctor, Lisa Bardack, released a statement saying that Clinton had been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia during a follow up visit on Friday: She was put on antibiotics, and was advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at (Sunday\u2019s) event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.

{"claim_id":34167,"hypothesis":"U.S. President Donald Trump brandished his middle finger as a gesture of disdain, disrespect, or anger towards an astronaut who publicly corrected him. ","date_published":"October 23, 2019","explanation_1":"In reality, the only consistent feature of these incidents is the inconsistency of the circumstances and context that surrounded them. As such, it appears doubtful that Trump typically brandishes his middle finger as a way of expressing disdain or anger or disrespect.

Anti-gun violence activist Shannon Watts tweeted out a short video clip of the incident, writing: \u201cWhen gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u2018fix\u2019 his hair. How is this even real life?\u201d When gently corrected by one of the astronauts about how other women have spacewalked, Donald Trump uses his middle finger to \u201cfix\u201d his hair. How is this even real life? pic.twitter.com\/9bnj7XfY1m \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) October 21, 2019 \u00a0 The left-leaning Facebook page The Other 98% repurposed Watts\u2019 viral tweet in a video:  Jack Brown, whose Twitter bio describes him as a \u201cbody language and emotional intelligence expert,\u201d posted a lengthy and widely shared analysis of the president\u2019s non-verbal gestures during the incident, concluding that: \u201cThis gesture is very much what it looks like \u2014 Donald Trump is giving Astronaut Jessica Meir the finger while she\u2019s walking in space. He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others. The second time the president rubbed his face, he first blew upwards towards his hair \u2014 which strongly suggests his hair was bothering him or a few strands were falling out of place, a perfectly plausible explanation for the movements he made with his middle finger. Taking all of this into account, it\u2019s therefore hard to explain how or why Trump was supposedly tossing out birds, one after the other, or whom he was targeting with them \u2014 nor to identity the particular \u201cstrong emotion\u201d that motivated such purported obscene gestures. Nonetheless, several commentators presented the gestures as just that, with Stephen Colbert joking that the second instance was Trump\u2019s \u201cstrong message to the African-American community,\u201d while another YouTube video suggested the birds were aimed at \u201cthe media\u201d:  In order for non-verbal gestures to have a clear meaning, an individual has to use them in at least a slightly consistent way. We know that Trump does sometimes use his middle finger to touch his face, typically rubbing from his eyebrow to his temple, parallel with his hair line. He has done this while he himself speaks, while others speak, while smiling, while nodding in agreement, while holding a neutral expression, while speaking to an ally whose comments are consistent with his own, while being confronted with the criticism of a close friend, and while hearing the plans of another world leader with whom he enjoys a complicated relationship. He has rubbed his face with his middle finger while an astronaut corrected his error, while a federal agency administrator said nothing in particular, and while another world leader said \u201cGood morning.\u201d","sources":" ","label":1,"subjects":"Politics","__index_level_0__":5202,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nIn October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts and online articles claiming that U.S. President Donald Trump had made an obscene gesture towards an astronaut after she corrected a factual error he had made.

He\u2019s subconsciously telling her to \u2018fuck off\u2019. But if you weren\u2019t paying close attention, you\u2019d miss it.\u201d The left-leaning blogs Crooks and Liars and the Daily Kos joined in the chorus of allegations, with posts whose headlines read \u201cTrump Flips Off Female Astronaut Who Corrected Him During Space Conference\u201d and \u201cPOTUS Flipped the Bird at Astronaut Jessica Meir,\u201d respectively. Various other news news outlets did not explicitly claim Trump made the obscene gesture, but they extensively repeated various iterations of the allegation or phrased their headlines as questions. Whether Trump stuck his middle finger up towards Meir as a gesture of anger or defiance against being publicly corrected depends on what his state of mind and intent were at that moment. Since neither we nor anyone else, other than the president himself, can gain access to his state of mind. However, we have reviewed many hours of video footage of Trump\u2019s public appearances and found several instances where he rubbed or scratched his face with his fingers. Our conclusion is that very little evidence exists to support the claim that Trump typically raises his middle finger in anger or disgust during similar incidents, while considerable evidence exists of a much simpler explanation: his hair, his eyebrows, and his face sometimes itch. October 2019 \u2014 Spacewalk On Oct. 18, Trump spoke by satellite link to NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, who had just performed the first all-female spacewalk outside the International Space Station. In his remarks, Trump said of the women: \u201cThey\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station \u2026\u201d In response, Meir politely corrected the president, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female space-walkers before us \u2014 this is just the first time there have been two women outside at the same time.\u201d As Meir made this point, Trump brought his right hand up to his face and briefly rubbed his middle finger along his forehead towards his right temple:  This was the source of the many claims that Trump had intended this ,movement as an obscene gesture of disdain, anger, or defiance against being publicly corrected, especially by a woman. Anecdotally, it appears that people more commonly use their index fingers, or multiple fingers, to scratch an itch or rub their faces, and the logic of the argument was that the unconventional use of a lone middle finger meant a simple, innocuous head scratch was not a plausible explanation for Trump\u2019s gesture, and that he must therefore have intended it as a way of telling Meir to \u201cfuck off,\u201d as Jack Brown\u2019s Twitter thread concluded. Few of these claims, often presented with a tone of absolute certainty and authority, mentioned the fact that Trump has actually used his middle finger in this way on multiple occasions, a sample of which we examine in this fact check. Brown has repeatedly claimed that Trump \u201crarely touches his face\/neck\/head while speaking,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhen he does occasionally commits [sic] such a faux pas, we can be sure his action is driven by strong emotions (which over-ride his normal suppression for facial touching).\u201d But none of the claims, including Brown\u2019s, mentioned the fact that Trump had done the same thing in the same room less than three minutes earlier. The full C-SPAN video of the event (as opposed to the truncated version posted to YouTube) shows that, towards the beginning, Trump made the very same movement with his right hand and middle finger. In that moment, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine was offering relatively generic introductory remarks as the room waited for the satellite link to be confirmed and for the president to begin his conversation with Meir and Koch. Immediately before Trump made the gesture, Bridenstine said, \u201cJust so everyone knows, there\u2019s a short window for the downlink, and also they\u2019ve got very busy work to do \u2026\u201d:  What \u201cstrong emotions\u201d (to use Brown\u2019s term) drove Trump to brandish his middle finger in this case? Was it \u201cThere\u2019s a short window for the downlink,\u201d which supposedly provoked such rage and defensiveness in him? Or did he simply have a particularly itchy face during that meeting, which manifested itself twice in less than three minutes? Nobody can say with certainty, but it appears to us much more likely that Trump was rubbing or scratching along his hairline because he had an itch or some discomfort, rather than that \u2014 twice in three minutes \u2014 he was non-verbally telling the NASA administrator and an astronaut where to go, so to speak. September 2019 \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno on Venezuela On Sep. 25, Trump hosted a multilateral meeting about the political crisis in Venezuela with the attendance of multiple Latin American heads of government, each of whom took their turn in offering remarks. Towards the end of the meeting, Ecuador\u2019s President Len\u00edn Moreno spoke, echoing official U.S. policy (and Trump\u2019s earlier comments) by condemning the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and addressing the issue of Venezuelans who had fled to other South American countries. Moreno said \u201cWe are talking about over four million people, who are humble people, who have fled \u2026\u201d when Trump raised his right hand to his face and used only his middle finger to briefly scratch between his nose and cheek:  Not only was Moreno expressing sentiments about Venezuela that were in line with U.S. policy and were similar to Trump\u2019s own remarks in the meeting, Moreno is, more broadly, something of an ally of Trump\u2019s. Since his election in May 2017, he has sided with the U.S. in opposing Maduro and supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the Venezuelan presidency, and he ended the policy of giving refuge to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador\u2019s London embassy, potentially laying the ground for his extradition to the United States. So, in using his middle finger during Moreno\u2019s rather friendly speech, was Trump expressing fury at some unknown slight? Or was he, once again, responding to no more than the nerve endings between his nose and cheek? And why did this middle-finger incident not attract the serious analysis of the same social media users and reporters who jumped into action on other occasions? Was it simply because it escaped their attention, or because the context did not provide a factual framework onto which a bird-flipping narrative could be superimposed? August 2019 \u2014 Working lunch with Macron On Aug. 24, on the fringes of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Trump held a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. With cameras snapping and journalists recording, the two men took a few minutes to make semi-public, introductory remarks. Trump and Macron have had a complicated public relationship, but based on our analysis of multiple hours of video footage, including several international summits, the two men tend to greet each other with particular warmth in public appearances. And at the Biarritz lunch, each spoke very positively of the other and of the (also historically complicated) Franco-American alliance. Trump declared that \u201cWe actually have a lot in common \u2026 we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. Every once in a while we go at it just a little bit, not very much, but we get along very well, we have a very good relationship \u2026\u201d Trump nodded in agreement throughout Macron\u2019s preliminary remarks. At one point, the French president said, \u201cWhen I look at Europe, especially, we need some new tools to relaunch our economy. We decided, we\u2019ll probably decide, to have new tax cuts, which is one of the ways to launch [an economy] \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump raised his left hand to his left temple, and appeared to use his middle finger to rub or scratch his left temple, all while continuing to nod in agreement with Macron:  To whom or to what was Trump non-verbally saying \u201cfuck off,\u201d in that moment? Macron in general? Macron\u2019s proposal to lower taxes, in particular? Tax cuts as a mechanism of economic stimulus? Someone off-camera positioned to his left? The security guard standing in the corner of the courtyard, behind the president? Or does none of that make sense because Trump was, yet again, sending no message? September 2017 \u2014 Robert Kraft and the anthem protests On Sep. 25, 2017, Trump spoke to reporters about the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision by some NFL players to protest against police brutality and racial injustice by symbolically kneeling during the playing of the U.S. national anthem before games. Trump repeatedly waded into the dispute, and two days earlier he had voiced his opinion that team owners should fire any player who took part in that form of protest, using the phrase \u201cson of a bitch\u201d to describe such players. Several team owners publicly criticized those remarks, including Trump\u2019s longtime personal friend, Robert Kraft, the owner and CEO of the New England Patriots. On Sep. 25, a reporter put it to the president that \u201cYour friend Robert Kraft said he was disappointed by what you said,\u201d to which Trump responded, \u201cWell that\u2019s okay. Look, he has to take his ideas and go with what he wants. I think [the protest] is very disrespectful to our country \u2026\u201d At that point, Trump made the now-familiar movement, bringing his right hand up to his face and dragging his middle finger from above his eyebrow to his right temple:  On the basis of that gesture, several Twitter users and websites, including Esquire magazine speculated or claimed that Trump had decided to flip the bird at the mention of Kraft\u2019s criticism. That\u2019s possible, of course, but it should be remembered that Trump and Kraft have been close friends for several decades, and a few months later Kraft said of Trump that: The only bad deal I\u2019ve had in my whole life is when my wife, bless her memory, died of ovarian cancer. [Trump] flew up to the funeral with Melania. They came to my home. And he called me once a week for a year and invited me to things. That was the darkest period of my life. And I\u2019m a pretty strong person. But my kids thought I was going to die. There were five or six people who were great to me. He was one of them \u2026 I know he does things or says things that\u2009\u2026\u2009You know, he doesn\u2019t mean everything he says. I\u2019m privileged to know that. People who don\u2019t know him don\u2019t see the better side. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing: He\u2019s very hardworking. I really believe that he wants to make this country better. And he\u2019s grown in the job. I\u2019ve seen it, too. For me, it\u2019s like having a high school buddy or a fraternity brother become president. It\u2019s weird in a way, but it\u2019s cool. I want to do anything I can to help him help this country. When Kraft was arrested and charged with solicitation of prostitution in February 2019, Trump made sympathetic remarks about his friend without explicitly proclaiming his innocence or offering unconditional support: NEW: Pres. Trump on charges against Patriots owner Robert Kraft: \u201cWell, it\u2019s very sad. I was very surprised to see it. He\u2019s proclaimed his innocence totally, but I\u2019m very surprised to see it.\u201d https:\/\/t.co\/bHHgDtBTng pic.twitter.com\/ZUqrwLMHXj \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) February 22, 2019  If the president were aiming a bird at Kraft in September 2017, the gesture didn\u2019t appear to have damaged the friendship between the two men. May 2017 \u2014 Paolo Gentiloni says \u201cGood morning\u201d On May 26 and 27 of 2017, Trump attended the annual G7 summit of world leaders, held on that occasion in Taormina, Italy. At the start of the first day, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni made an introductory speech to welcome the many heads of state and government sitting around a large table. Trump was seated two places to Gentiloni\u2019s right. The prime minister began his speech with, \u201cWell, good morning. Bonjour.\u201d Just as Gentiloni was issuing the same greeting in Italian, Trump raised his left hand to his left eyebrow and used only his middle finger to rub his eyebrow and temple:  As we examined in a fact check at the time, Trump\u2019s stray digit prompted multiple left-leaning websites and social media accounts to jump into action, speculating or claiming that the president had intended to fling an obscene gesture of disrespect towards his Italian host. What none of those accounts included, though, was even a token explanation of why Trump was purportedly doing that or how their allegations made sense. Was the U.S. president, as some claimed in the astronaut incident, responding to what Gentiloni had just said? If so, what exactly was it about \u201cGood morning, bonjour\u201d that so outraged Trump? Furthermore, Trump had been chatting and sharing a joke with Gentiloni and Macron just a few seconds earlier and did so again later on:  February 2017 \u2014 Black History Month On Feb. 1, 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump hosted a Black History Month celebration at the White House. Before the meeting began in earnest, and in the midst of a clearly very cordial atmosphere, Trump twice brandished his middle finger. First, the president quickly rubbed from his right eyebrow to his right temple just after sitting down at the table. He didn\u2019t look at anyone in particular, and the only discernible conversation immediately before his gesture involved a woman (not visible on camera) saying \u201cYou know chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u201d to the laughter of several attendees, including Trump himself and his former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman, who was seated immediately to the president\u2019s right. It\u2019s not clear to what the woman was referring, but it\u2019s possible that Vice President Mike Pence had just pulled out a chair for her, in a gesture of what might be described as old-fashioned etiquette. (Trump made the same gesture for Manigault Newman before he took his own seat). Seven seconds later, Trump again ran his right middle finger parallel with his hairline, starting at his eyebrow, after blowing upwards towards his hair. He then immediately followed up those movements by rubbing his right eyebrow with his right index finger:  The atmosphere in the room before the meeting was visibly and clearly very warm, with attendees chatting, smiling, and laughing together. The comment that immediately preceded Trump\u2019s first middle finger gesture was a light-hearted remark, possibly about Pence\u2019s \u201cchivalry,\u201d which prompted laughter from Trump and others.

No specifics accompanied the rumor, such as how the\u00a0fine might be incurred, or what would happen if DAPL were constructed without the approval to do so.

The Corps\u2019 review process and its decisions have been ratified by two federal courts. The Army Corps confirmed this again today when it stated its \u201cpolicy decision\u201d does \u201cnot alter the Army\u2019s position that the Corps\u2019 prior reviews and actions have comported with legal requirements.\u201d In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline. The White House\u2019s directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency.

The metal debris resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it turned out to be the vaporized remains of an automobile. The make of the vehicle was unidentifiable at the scene.The folks in the lab finally figured out what it was, and pieced together the events that led up to its demise. It seems that a former Air Force sergeant had somehow got hold of a JATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) unit. JATO units are solid fuel rockets used to give heavy military transport airplanes an extra push for take-off from short airfields. Dried desert lakebeds are the location of choice for breaking the world ground vehicle speed record. The sergeant took the JATO unit into the Arizona desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. He attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, accelerated to a high speed, and fired off the rocket. The facts, as best as could be determined, are as follows: The operator was driving a 1967 Chevy Impala. He ignited the JATO unit approximately 3.9 miles from the crash site. This was established by the location of a prominently scorched and melted strip of asphalt. The vehicle quickly reached a speed of between 250 and 300 mph and continued at that speed, under full power, for an additional 20-25 seconds. The soon-to-be pilot experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners. The Chevy remained on the straight highway for approximately 2.6 miles (15-20 seconds) before the driver applied the brakes, completely melting them, blowing the tires, and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface. The vehicle then became airborne for an additional 1.3 miles, impacted the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, and left a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock. Most of the driver\u2019s remains were not recovered; however, small fragments of bone, teeth, and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel. Maybe it\u2019s the Wile E. Coyote-ness of it all, the \u201cso real you can almost touch it\u201d mental image of a smoldering wreck sticking out of a cliff face. Perhaps it\u2019s the vicarious enjoyment of a Tim Allen-ish \u201cMore Power!\u201d fantasy carried to its fatal yet hilarious conclusion. Or maybe it\u2019s a simple matter of cars and the men who love them, the eternal love affair. Whatever. The boys love it, and that\u2019s all that matters. This tale of vehicular velocity ferocity has been popular among servicemen since the late 1970s. In those early word-of-mouth versions, the JATO was taken from a cargo plane or out of a warehouse on base, thereby answering a key question left up in the air in later versions: Where did the intrepid lad obtain the engine?

The car was last seen going end over end across San Francisco bay. Another reader heard it in 1964 while stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. In that version, the unmanned JATO\u2019d car went airborne and smashed into a tree, destroying both car and plant.

(His other questions were about the economy, Sen. Arlen Specter's party switch, and why Biden wasn't included among members of Obama's team named to  People  magazine's list of most beautiful people.)

Sagging has another rumored origin (also false), one less well-traveled than the \u201cgay inmates advertising for sex\u201d postulation:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] What\u2019s the origin of Gang-banger pants? You know, worn really low and baggy? Before they became a fashion statement, and\/or MADE that way by assorted clothing companies, I heard it originated in a prison: An inmate was on suicide watch and couldn\u2019t have his belt, which the other inmates were either outraged by or thought was ridiculous given the inmate in question. So they started wearing theirs really low in protest\/solidarity. Anyway, that\u2019s what I heard. Another discredited theory says ghetto hoodlums adopted the fashion of wearing their pants in the sagging style to better conceal weapons from rival gang members and police. While it is true a gun or knife can be effectively stashed out of sight in droopy pants, it can also be hidden in more form-fitting bottoms, especially when the pants-wearer tops his cache with an untucked sports jersey, pullover, or sweatshirt. The most intriguing aspect of the \u201ctrolling for gay sex\u201d rumor lies not in its veracity, but in its acceptance as gospel by those who encounter it and who are then moved to pass it along to others. While the combination of two facts (homosexuality in prison and falling-down pants worn by inmates) accounts for the origin of the belief that links the one to the other, its spread is attributable to the prevailing dislike of the fashion. Those who choose to wear their pants this way cite comfort as their motive and so find justification for this imitation of rap stars and felons, two groups perceived as toughly self-sufficient and therefore worthy of emulation; those who do not follow this fashion see only the crotches of jeans hanging at or above the knee, hobbling their wearers in a goofy manner. (One can walk in sagging pants. But one can\u2019t run in them.) The rumor becomes a way of passing along one group\u2019s disdain for another\u2019s sartorial practice.

Sagging has another rumored origin (also false), one less well-traveled than the \u201cgay inmates advertising for sex\u201d postulation:  [Collected on the Internet, 2003] What\u2019s the origin of Gang-banger pants? You know, worn really low and baggy? Before they became a fashion statement, and\/or MADE that way by assorted clothing companies, I heard it originated in a prison: An inmate was on suicide watch and couldn\u2019t have his belt, which the other inmates were either outraged by or thought was ridiculous given the inmate in question. So they started wearing theirs really low in protest\/solidarity. Anyway, that\u2019s what I heard. Another discredited theory says ghetto hoodlums adopted the fashion of wearing their pants in the sagging style to better conceal weapons from rival gang members and police. While it is true a gun or knife can be effectively stashed out of sight in droopy pants, it can also be hidden in more form-fitting bottoms, especially when the pants-wearer tops his cache with an untucked sports jersey, pullover, or sweatshirt. The most intriguing aspect of the \u201ctrolling for gay sex\u201d rumor lies not in its veracity, but in its acceptance as gospel by those who encounter it and who are then moved to pass it along to others. While the combination of two facts (homosexuality in prison and falling-down pants worn by inmates) accounts for the origin of the belief that links the one to the other, its spread is attributable to the prevailing dislike of the fashion. Those who choose to wear their pants this way cite comfort as their motive and so find justification for this imitation of rap stars and felons, two groups perceived as toughly self-sufficient and therefore worthy of emulation; those who do not follow this fashion see only the crotches of jeans hanging at or above the knee, hobbling their wearers in a goofy manner. (One can walk in sagging pants. But one can\u2019t run in them.) The rumor becomes a way of passing along one group\u2019s disdain for another\u2019s sartorial practice. Communicating that the saggers are unwittingly offering their backsides to all takers when they think they are mimicking admired rappers and identifying with tough guys no sensible person would mess with becomes a way of saying \u201cThe joke is really on them.\u201d This same sense of surreptitious delight over being in on a prank someone looked down upon is unknowingly playing on himself fuels another urban legend that involves medallions flaunted by society matrons or Chinese character-emblazoned sweaters proudly worn by their knitters and even some of the \u201cmisunderstood souvenir\u201d tales told about globe-trotting tourists.n\nClaim: The fashion of sagging one's pants was born of a prison mode of signaling sexual availability.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"contradiction","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence provided debunks the claim that sagging was originally a prison code for signaling sexual availability. While it is true that the style originated in prisons due to oversizing of clothes and lack of belts, leading to unintentionally sagging pants, the specific claim that it was a signal for sexual availability is identified as a rumor with no factual basis. Additionally, the text explains that the theory was discredited and is more about the spread of an urban legend fueled by disdain for the fashion rather than based on factual origins."}

Not only did news organizations uncover the porous and mismanaged nature of the \u201cban,\u201d noting that the measures came too late, but some experts found little to no evidence that the ban resulted in a significant prevention of a spread of COVID-19 cases. A more accurate way to describe Trump\u2019s Jan. 31 proclamation is as a \u201crestriction\u201d on travel from mainland China \u2014 not as an outright ban. There were numerous exemptions in place that appeared to nullify the goal of preventing travel into the country to stop the spread of the virus. These exemptions included people traveling from the Special Autonomous Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and U.S. citizens, residents, their spouses, and close relatives. More details about the exemptions can be found here. Hong Kong and Macau are both governed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle that allows them to retain their own forms of administration, but with limited autonomy. They are still largely under the control of the People\u2019s Republic of China. From both of these regions, Chinese citizens and other foreign nationals have been able to travel into the U.S. since restrictions were imposed. An Associated Press report found that more than 5,600 Chinese and foreign nationals flew to the U.S. in February 2020 alone. Around Feb. 2, at least 15 cases of the virus had been detected in Hong Kong, and seven more were found in Macau that were later traced to the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan. Even before the restriction was imposed, Americans and other nationalities came into the U.S. from mainland China unabated. According to an April 2020 report from The New York Times, at least 430,000 people arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since the outbreak was reported on the last day of 2019, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after the February restrictions were put in place. Thousands of these travelers flew directly from Wuhan. At least 60%\u00a0of the travelers arriving in the U.S. on direct flights from China in February were not American citizens, according to government data. Screening and monitoring of many travelers was found to be sporadic, and the data shared with states was incorrect, plagued by bad telephone numbers, erroneous itineraries, and travelers even claiming they had never been to China. According to internal notes and emails received by The Associated Press, there were numerous examples of travelers slipping through the cracks in the system. In one email from Feb. 6, 2020, a CDC employee wrote: \u201cHearing word of people already leaking through screening system and ending up in states without the funneling airports. Knew it would not be perfect, but it has begun.\u201d Furthermore, research being conducted in the aftermath of travel restrictions showed little evidence that they had a major impact on curbing the spread of the virus. A paper published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looked at the impact of border control measures implemented in several countries. They concluded \u201cthat these measures likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19.\u201d On June 8, 2020, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, released a working paper looking at the effects of Trump\u2019s travel restrictions from China.

These exemptions included people traveling from the Special Autonomous Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and U.S. citizens, residents, their spouses, and close relatives. More details about the exemptions can be found here. Hong Kong and Macau are both governed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle that allows them to retain their own forms of administration, but with limited autonomy. They are still largely under the control of the People\u2019s Republic of China. From both of these regions, Chinese citizens and other foreign nationals have been able to travel into the U.S. since restrictions were imposed. An Associated Press report found that more than 5,600 Chinese and foreign nationals flew to the U.S. in February 2020 alone. Around Feb. 2, at least 15 cases of the virus had been detected in Hong Kong, and seven more were found in Macau that were later traced to the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan. Even before the restriction was imposed, Americans and other nationalities came into the U.S. from mainland China unabated. According to an April 2020 report from The New York Times, at least 430,000 people arrived in the United States on direct flights from China since the outbreak was reported on the last day of 2019, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after the February restrictions were put in place. Thousands of these travelers flew directly from Wuhan. At least 60%\u00a0of the travelers arriving in the U.S. on direct flights from China in February were not American citizens, according to government data. Screening and monitoring of many travelers was found to be sporadic, and the data shared with states was incorrect, plagued by bad telephone numbers, erroneous itineraries, and travelers even claiming they had never been to China. According to internal notes and emails received by The Associated Press, there were numerous examples of travelers slipping through the cracks in the system. In one email from Feb. 6, 2020, a CDC employee wrote: \u201cHearing word of people already leaking through screening system and ending up in states without the funneling airports. Knew it would not be perfect, but it has begun.\u201d Furthermore, research being conducted in the aftermath of travel restrictions showed little evidence that they had a major impact on curbing the spread of the virus. A paper published in March in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looked at the impact of border control measures implemented in several countries. They concluded \u201cthat these measures likely slowed the rate of exportation from mainland China to other countries, but are insufficient to contain the global spread of COVID-19.\u201d On June 8, 2020, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, released a working paper looking at the effects of Trump\u2019s travel restrictions from China. They noted that historically, such restrictions have been ineffective at halting or significantly delaying the spread of pandemics. They concluded:n\nClaim: In February 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump enforced a complete ban on travel from mainland China, a signature policy move that helped save many lives from the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"None"}

Registering for the Selective Service does not enlist a person into the military.Army recruiting operations are proceeding as normal.But as evidenced by the reply embedded above, worries about the draft nevertheless persisted. And an aspect of that lingering fear involved whether antidepressants (or therapeutic stimulants) disqualified people from being drafted.As indicated in the\u00a0U.S. Army Recruiting Command\u2019s Twitter replies and fact check, no one has been drafted in the United States since 1973. As such, any information about a potential future draft can only be based on existing information regarding volunteer recruitment.Privately-run resource Military.com hosted a FAQ about recruitment, and question number nine had to do with antidepressants and enlistment, not a draft. Answers were compiled from information submitted on forums \u201cmonitored and answered by real recruiters,\u201d and the scope of the question about whether \u201canti-depressants disqualifying\u201d was wide. Two answers were submitted, with a broad scope of application to putative draftees and recruits.According to that information, antidepressants disqualified potential recruits for a year after ceasing to take the medication. Moreover, the answering recruiter said self-initiated cessation was insufficient to enlist. A second question appeared to have been answered by an Air Force member:Response 1: Anti depressants are disqualifying for 1 year after you stop taking them. You MUST stop with your doctors advice, DO NOT stop on your own. These medications often have to be reduced slowly to lower side effects and reduce risk of relapse. Once you are off and depression free for 1 year get copies of your treatment paperwork, including therapy notes and take them with you to your recruiter. They will submit the documents to [United States Military Entrance Processing Command\/Station, or MEPS] for review. MEPS will either DQ you, allow you to physical and enlist, or allow you to physical with a waiver (most likely).Response 2: You\u2019ll need to bring my medical records from the doctor who prescribed the anti-depressants. You\u2019ll go to MEPS, take the [Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB] but your processing will be terminated at a certain point due to being honest about depression. Your records will be sent to the [Air Force] surgeon general\u2019s office for review. This supposedly takes between six weeks and three months \u2014 mine took a full three months. If the waiver is granted, you\u2019ll be cleared to return to MEPS. On your return trip, they\u2019ll do a height\/weight check then send you offsite to a psych consult. The doctor will then send his recommendation to MEPS where you will be reviewed further. This took nearly five weeks for me. If you are deemed fit for service, you will return to MEPS for job selection. Contrary to what I was initially told, depression rules out many jobs in the AF.It appears that the military and its branches had a fluid and changing policy on mental health conditions, medication, and medical history. In November 2017, USA Today reported on a previously undisclosed policy allowing people with a medical history of mental illness to obtain waivers and serve:People with a history of \u201cself-mutilation,\u201d bipolar disorder, depression and drug and alcohol abuse can now seek waivers to join the Army under an unannounced policy enacted in August [2017], according to documents obtained by USA TODAY.The decision to open Army recruiting to those with mental health conditions comes as the service faces the challenging goal of recruiting 80,000 new soldiers through September 2018. To meet last year\u2019s goal of 69,000, the Army accepted more recruits who fared poorly on aptitude tests, increased the number of waivers granted for marijuana use and offered hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses.U.S. Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Randy Taylor told the outlet that the new guidelines were not necessarily hard and fast ones:\u201cWith the additional data available, Army officials can now consider applicants as a whole person, allowing a series of Army leaders and medical professionals to review the case fully to assess the applicant\u2019s physical limitations or medical conditions and their possible impact upon the applicant\u2019s ability to complete training and finish an Army career \u2026 These waivers are not considered lightly.\u201dIn April 2018, ArmyTimes.com\u00a0reported that relaxation of prior policies around medical and mental health histories had caused controversy following the November 2017\u00a0USA Today\u00a0piece. Again, the specifics of the policy did not seem to be fully clear at that time, and Army higher-ups described the changes as something of a case-by-case basis adopted for children of servicemen and women with more comprehensive childhood records:The Army\u2019s personnel chief responded to the memo in November [2017] by clarifying that it was mistakenly distributed, but adding that the service was beginning to have more of an open mind about recruits\u2019 mental health history.\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that the conditions themselves have been unfairly characterized,\u201d Lt. Gen. Thomas Seamands, the Army G-1, said in a statement at the time. \u201cFor example, a child who received behavioral counseling at age 10 would be forever banned from military service were it not for the ability to make a waiver request.\u201d\u2026\u00a0And in fact, it has been a concern for many military families. A spate of military children have been kicked out of initial military training after their childhood medical records were added to their service member records, sometimes revealing that they had turned to therapy as young children.It was also, as noted, a focus on volunteer enlistment \u2014 not a policy enacted with a draft in mind:\u201cThe waivers are really indicating to me that our recruiters are doing exactly what we\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey said [in April 2018]. \u201cIf they see something in the record that is of concern or is a question of meeting a DoD standard, they ask for somebody to review it.\u201dIn January 2019, the\u00a0Psychological Health Center of Excellence (or PHCoE, formerly known as the Deployment Health Clinical Center) Clinician\u2019s Corner blog included an entry titled \u201cNavy Changes Policy on Psychotropic Medications and Aviation.\u201d It discussed whether a service member who was diagnosed with a mental health condition could maintain their military flight status during treatment, explaining:Can a service member who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and is being treated with psychotropic medication maintain their military flight status while in treatment? YES! The use of psychotropic medications was disqualifying for U. S. Naval Aviators (pilots, flight officers, air traffic controllers and aircrew members) before November 2018. After this date, the U.S. Navy Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide (ARWG)(link is external) was updated to allow Navy and Marine Corps personnel who are on a stable dose of FDA-approved psychotropic medications to maintain their flight status during treatment.According to the PHCoE blog, the first Navy waivers were granted in 2017 \u2014 around the time the first report disclosing the existence of waivers appeared:The first waiver for a class of psychotropic medication use in Army aircrews was granted in 2004 for a diagnosis of chronic pain. Currently, Army aviators on stable doses of selected medications for most mental health diagnoses are eligible to maintain flight status. Similarly, Air Force policy allows designated personnel to fly while on monotherapy with one of four approved medications for treatment of specified conditions after the prescribed waiting periods officially went into effect in 2013. The Air Force is currently conducting a 20-year study to follow airmen on antidepressants, where results from the first five years found that no antidepressant medication has been associated with any Air Force mishap since the protocol started in 2013.The first waivers granted in the Navy began in 2017, for diagnoses of major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Upon review of selected individuals, the Consult Advisory Board voted to allow aviators, in specified flying billets (e.g. dual-piloted, non-tactical aircraft), to be eligible for waiver consideration with continued therapy with FDA-approved psychotropic medication(s). Consideration for a waiver may be requested after a suitable period of observation in a non-flying status has elapsed, provided that the dose of the medication(s) is stable and the clinical condition is determined to be in stable remission. The duration of this period of observation in a non-flying status is dictated by the psychiatric diagnosis and is outlined in the relevant section of the ARWG.Operation Military Kids\u2019 \u201c20 Health Conditions That May Not Allow You to Join the Military\u201d page was updated on January 3 2020, and it contained a section on depression. According to that site, a history of depression (and presumably having taken antidepressants) might make it \u201cdifficult\u201d (but not impossible) to enlist:Since the U.S. Armed Forces deal with arming individuals with powerful weapons it must tread on mental health very carefully. Though people with mental health concerns are very good people that are still capable of living high-quality lives, the U.S. Military is very strict on how it handles mood disorders \u2026 [That] means that if you or someone you know that is considering enlisting in the U.S. Military has been diagnosed with [depression] in the past, it may be difficult to join.Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were labeled \u201cpossibly disqualifying,\u201d while bipolar disorder was described as \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder was also described as a disqualifying condition, with the following caveat:The military is currently reexamining its approach for ADHD and has noted recently that it might start assessing circumstances on a case by case basis.After conflict between the United States and Iran was initiated due to Suleimani\u2019s death, speculation about war led to rumors that using antidepressants disqualified Americans from any military draft. An unrelated hoax exploited simmering draft fears, leading military recruiters to reiterate that reinstatement of the draft was a legislatively complicated process. Given that nearly half a century had passed since the previous active draft, the only up-to-date information available had to do with voluntary enlistment. As of 2017, the United States military had relaxed their policies about mental health and antidepressants to some degree, but those policies appeared to be in ongoing flux. Further, it was incredibly difficult to extrapolate how such fluid guidelines might apply to an involuntary enlistment process or draft. Because of this, we have rated this claim Decontextualized due to the complexity of its elements.","sources":"https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/australia-scott-morrison-bushfires-disinformation\/, https:\/\/recruiting.army.mil\/News\/Article-Display\/Article\/2051787\/urgent-news-army-recruiting-discredits-military-draft-texts\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/wetritzcracker\/status\/1213600480732934144, https:\/\/wpde.com\/news\/local\/memes-about-wwiii-and-military-draft-inflate-uncertainty-heres-the-truth, https:\/\/www.armytimes.com\/news\/your-army\/2018\/04\/20\/after-waiver-controversy-army-to-evaluate-troops-mental-health-pasts-on-case-by-case-basis\/, https:\/\/www.operationmilitarykids.org\/military-disqualifications\/#depression, https:\/\/twitter.com\/the_fat_bro\/status\/1214606604655636481, https:\/\/www.vox.com\/world\/2019\/7\/8\/18693297\/us-iran-war-trump-nuclear-iraq, https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Does+Using+Antidepressants+Disqualify+You+from+a+Military+Draft%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F&via=KimLaCapria, https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/live-updates\/iran-commander-vows-harsher-revenge-against-us-relief-in-tehran-today-after-trump-speech-2020-01-09\/, https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/politics\/2017\/11\/12\/army-lifts-ban-recruits-history-self-mutilation-other-mental-health-issues\/853131001\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214638966126891009, https:\/\/t.co\/4gP2ZoyUJe, https:\/\/twitter.com\/wetritzcracker\/status\/1213600480732934144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214644346320048130, https:\/\/www.military.com\/join-armed-forces\/military-recruiting-process-faqs.html, https:\/\/api.whatsapp.com\/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/kopi_wan\/status\/1213157117080662016, https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/cws\/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/kopi_wan\/status\/1213157117080662016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214644346320048130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/author\/kim\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/deelightfuller\/status\/1213488354697895936, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/were-an-army-veterans-prosthetic-legs-repossessed-after-a-va-and-medicare-dispute\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/USArmy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/t.co\/csGpTQNfQc, https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/01\/08\/794729081\/u-s-army-alert-you-are-not-being-drafted, https:\/\/t.co\/cs3ZhrX3Yf, https:\/\/www.pdhealth.mil\/news\/blog\/navy-changes-policy-psychotropic-medications-and-aviation, https:\/\/twitter.com\/usarec\/status\/1214638966126891009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truthorfiction.com%2Fdoes-using-antidepressants-disqualify-you-from-a-military-draft%2F, https:\/\/twitter.com\/SSS_gov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/WWIII?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/twitter.com\/torideprow\/status\/1213216042408972288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw, https:\/\/www.truthorfiction.com\/category\/fact-checks\/viral-content\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/torideprow\/status\/1213216042408972288","label":3,"subjects":"Fact Checks, Viral Content","__index_level_0__":2330,"input_string":"Given on the evidence, determine if the claim is true, false, not enough information to confirm, or partially true and false. \n\nEvidence:\n\nAfter a January 3 2020 United States-led strike killed Iranian\u00a0Maj.

Col. Randy Taylor told the outlet that the new guidelines were not necessarily hard and fast ones:\u201cWith the additional data available, Army officials can now consider applicants as a whole person, allowing a series of Army leaders and medical professionals to review the case fully to assess the applicant\u2019s physical limitations or medical conditions and their possible impact upon the applicant\u2019s ability to complete training and finish an Army career \u2026 These waivers are not considered lightly.\u201dIn April 2018, ArmyTimes.com\u00a0reported that relaxation of prior policies around medical and mental health histories had caused controversy following the November 2017\u00a0USA Today\u00a0piece. Again, the specifics of the policy did not seem to be fully clear at that time, and Army higher-ups described the changes as something of a case-by-case basis adopted for children of servicemen and women with more comprehensive childhood records:The Army\u2019s personnel chief responded to the memo in November [2017] by clarifying that it was mistakenly distributed, but adding that the service was beginning to have more of an open mind about recruits\u2019 mental health history.\u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that the conditions themselves have been unfairly characterized,\u201d Lt. Gen. Thomas Seamands, the Army G-1, said in a statement at the time. \u201cFor example, a child who received behavioral counseling at age 10 would be forever banned from military service were it not for the ability to make a waiver request.\u201d\u2026\u00a0And in fact, it has been a concern for many military families. A spate of military children have been kicked out of initial military training after their childhood medical records were added to their service member records, sometimes revealing that they had turned to therapy as young children.It was also, as noted, a focus on volunteer enlistment \u2014 not a policy enacted with a draft in mind:\u201cThe waivers are really indicating to me that our recruiters are doing exactly what we\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d Sergeant Major of the Army Dan Dailey said [in April 2018]. \u201cIf they see something in the record that is of concern or is a question of meeting a DoD standard, they ask for somebody to review it.\u201dIn January 2019, the\u00a0Psychological Health Center of Excellence (or PHCoE, formerly known as the Deployment Health Clinical Center) Clinician\u2019s Corner blog included an entry titled \u201cNavy Changes Policy on Psychotropic Medications and Aviation.\u201d It discussed whether a service member who was diagnosed with a mental health condition could maintain their military flight status during treatment, explaining:Can a service member who has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder and is being treated with psychotropic medication maintain their military flight status while in treatment? YES! The use of psychotropic medications was disqualifying for U. S. Naval Aviators (pilots, flight officers, air traffic controllers and aircrew members) before November 2018. After this date, the U.S. Navy Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide (ARWG)(link is external) was updated to allow Navy and Marine Corps personnel who are on a stable dose of FDA-approved psychotropic medications to maintain their flight status during treatment.According to the PHCoE blog, the first Navy waivers were granted in 2017 \u2014 around the time the first report disclosing the existence of waivers appeared:The first waiver for a class of psychotropic medication use in Army aircrews was granted in 2004 for a diagnosis of chronic pain. Currently, Army aviators on stable doses of selected medications for most mental health diagnoses are eligible to maintain flight status. Similarly, Air Force policy allows designated personnel to fly while on monotherapy with one of four approved medications for treatment of specified conditions after the prescribed waiting periods officially went into effect in 2013. The Air Force is currently conducting a 20-year study to follow airmen on antidepressants, where results from the first five years found that no antidepressant medication has been associated with any Air Force mishap since the protocol started in 2013.The first waivers granted in the Navy began in 2017, for diagnoses of major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Upon review of selected individuals, the Consult Advisory Board voted to allow aviators, in specified flying billets (e.g. dual-piloted, non-tactical aircraft), to be eligible for waiver consideration with continued therapy with FDA-approved psychotropic medication(s). Consideration for a waiver may be requested after a suitable period of observation in a non-flying status has elapsed, provided that the dose of the medication(s) is stable and the clinical condition is determined to be in stable remission. The duration of this period of observation in a non-flying status is dictated by the psychiatric diagnosis and is outlined in the relevant section of the ARWG.Operation Military Kids\u2019 \u201c20 Health Conditions That May Not Allow You to Join the Military\u201d page was updated on January 3 2020, and it contained a section on depression. According to that site, a history of depression (and presumably having taken antidepressants) might make it \u201cdifficult\u201d (but not impossible) to enlist:Since the U.S. Armed Forces deal with arming individuals with powerful weapons it must tread on mental health very carefully. Though people with mental health concerns are very good people that are still capable of living high-quality lives, the U.S. Military is very strict on how it handles mood disorders \u2026 [That] means that if you or someone you know that is considering enlisting in the U.S. Military has been diagnosed with [depression] in the past, it may be difficult to join.Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder were labeled \u201cpossibly disqualifying,\u201d while bipolar disorder was described as \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder was also described as a disqualifying condition, with the following caveat:The military is currently reexamining its approach for ADHD and has noted recently that it might start assessing circumstances on a case by case basis.After conflict between the United States and Iran was initiated due to Suleimani\u2019s death, speculation about war led to rumors that using antidepressants disqualified Americans from any military draft. An unrelated hoax exploited simmering draft fears, leading military recruiters to reiterate that reinstatement of the draft was a legislatively complicated process. Given that nearly half a century had passed since the previous active draft, the only up-to-date information available had to do with voluntary enlistment. As of 2017, the United States military had relaxed their policies about mental health and antidepressants to some degree, but those policies appeared to be in ongoing flux. Further, it was incredibly difficult to extrapolate how such fluid guidelines might apply to an involuntary enlistment process or draft. Because of this, we have rated this claim Decontextualized due to the complexity of its elements.n\nClaim: Any history of antidepressant use disqualifies a person from the military and\/or the draft.\nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The evidence shows that the policies regarding antidepressant use and military enlistment have been fluid and have undergone changes over the years. While antidepressants can disqualify individuals from enlisting in the military for a period (typically a year after cessation of use, as per the information provided), there are instances where waivers can be obtained, and the policy has been relaxed to some extent since 2017. The policies are not absolute and can depend on the individual's condition and the evaluation of medical authorities within the military. Moreover, the claim specifically addressing the draft is harder to verify since the U.S. has not had a draft since 1973, and any current information only pertains to voluntary enlistment. Therefore, the statement that any history of antidepressant use unequivocally disqualifies a person from the military or a potential draft is neither entirely true nor entirely false."}

We have saved the original news release as a pdf. Using mobile devices to inform, persuade and ultimately change health behaviors is all the rage. A recent meta-analysis suggests that these efforts can be effective when it comes to convincing pregnant smokers to cut back, although it also finds that persuading smokers to stop is less successful. This news release describes a study that used an experimental design (randomized intervention and control groups) to explore whether text messages would be effective in helping pregnant women to stop smoking. Those messages did not produce any statistically significant reduction in smoking cessation rates, as the study itself makes clear. So it\u2019s concerning to see this news release headlined: \u201cText messaging program may help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d A more accurate headline would have been: \u201cText messaging program not shown to help pregnant women kick the smoking habit.\u201d The researchers did find a possible benefit in older mothers-to-be and in individuals further along in their pregnancies. However, finding from such smaller subgroups are considered \u201chypothesis-generating,\u201d\u00a0meaning they can point to trends that merit further study. They cannot provide conclusive evidence that a treatment provides a health benefit. You can read more about subgroups and their limitations\u00a0here. The bottom line here seems to be that the messages were not very influential, although the news release portrays the effort as a success story. And that misleading framing has already been carried through to some news stories about the study. Other journalists looking into the study should tread carefully. Mothers-to-be smoking while pregnant poses health harms for fetuses and early childhood, yet a reported 10 percent of pregnant women continue to smoke.

The traveler declared the single, sealed package of pet food to customs officials. And while those residing in the United States may not consider dead birds as a treat for pets, small freeze-dried birds, such as quail, are sold as pet food in Asia. This rumor spun off of a release from CBP about a bag of dead birds that was confiscated from a traveler\u2019s luggage at Dulles: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists recently seized a package of tiny dead birds in a passenger\u2019s baggage at Washington Dulles International Airport. The traveler arrived on a flight from Beijing, China January 27 and was destined to an address in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. During a baggage examination, CBP agriculture specialists discovered a package with pictures of a cat and dog that the passenger said was cat food. The package contained a bunch of unknown small birds, about 2.5 to 3.5 inches in length. While this was a rather mundane incident, it occurred during heightened concerns about the spread of a new coronavirus in China and sparked a flurry of news coverage, some of which appeared to play on people\u2019s fears. Note the creepy, ominous music in this clip from WUSA: Other reports contained misleading details. For instance, some outlets reported that this person\u2019s suitcase \u2014 and not a sealed package in a suitcase \u2014 was full of dead birds. Others were overly dismissive about the traveler\u2019s claim that these birds were pet food, writing that \u201ca package of tiny dead birds [was] passed off as pet food.\u201d The Daily Mail went as far as to claim this traveler had \u201cdisguised\u201d these dead birds as pet food. This led some on social media to believe that the passenger had ulterior motives, had hidden this package from authorities, or was attempting to spread disease in the United States: Anything hidden coming from China should be banned and those people should be punished. There was an Ulterior Motive there. Call for an investigation. Some people are wanting to spread everything to the United States and everywhere else in the world. Other social media users wondered if this was an act of terrorism: Does anyone know why someone would travel with dead birds packaged to look like pet food? Is it cultural food item\/medicine, it\u2019s it terrorism? A crazy person who freeze dried all her dead birds for companionship? There is nothing online for this answer that I could find.

CBP also confirmed that the single package was sealed, so the suitcase wasn\u2019t full of loose dead birds, and that it wasn\u2019t a package of pet food emptied and filled again with dead birds in an attempt to smuggle it through customs. Lastly, CBP told us that this was treated as a \u201croutine case of a traveler in possession of prohibited agriculture products.\u201d\u00a0 Steve Sapp, a public affairs officer with CBP, told us: It should also be noted that while the words \u201cpet food\u201d don\u2019t typically conjure up images of dead birds for those residing in the United States, this is a genuine pet food product sold in China.

This rumor spun off of a release from CBP about a bag of dead birds that was confiscated from a traveler\u2019s luggage at Dulles: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists recently seized a package of tiny dead birds in a passenger\u2019s baggage at Washington Dulles International Airport. The traveler arrived on a flight from Beijing, China January 27 and was destined to an address in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. During a baggage examination, CBP agriculture specialists discovered a package with pictures of a cat and dog that the passenger said was cat food. The package contained a bunch of unknown small birds, about 2.5 to 3.5 inches in length. While this was a rather mundane incident, it occurred during heightened concerns about the spread of a new coronavirus in China and sparked a flurry of news coverage, some of which appeared to play on people\u2019s fears. Note the creepy, ominous music in this clip from WUSA: Other reports contained misleading details. For instance, some outlets reported that this person\u2019s suitcase \u2014 and not a sealed package in a suitcase \u2014 was full of dead birds. Others were overly dismissive about the traveler\u2019s claim that these birds were pet food, writing that \u201ca package of tiny dead birds [was] passed off as pet food.\u201d The Daily Mail went as far as to claim this traveler had \u201cdisguised\u201d these dead birds as pet food. This led some on social media to believe that the passenger had ulterior motives, had hidden this package from authorities, or was attempting to spread disease in the United States: Anything hidden coming from China should be banned and those people should be punished. There was an Ulterior Motive there. Call for an investigation. Some people are wanting to spread everything to the United States and everywhere else in the world. Other social media users wondered if this was an act of terrorism: Does anyone know why someone would travel with dead birds packaged to look like pet food? Is it cultural food item\/medicine, it\u2019s it terrorism? A crazy person who freeze dried all her dead birds for companionship? There is nothing online for this answer that I could find. We reached out to CBP for more information about this incident. The agency told us that the traveler declared this item to border agents. In other words, no one attempted to \u201chide\u201d it from officials. CBP also confirmed that the single package was sealed, so the suitcase wasn\u2019t full of loose dead birds, and that it wasn\u2019t a package of pet food emptied and filled again with dead birds in an attempt to smuggle it through customs. Lastly, CBP told us that this was treated as a \u201croutine case of a traveler in possession of prohibited agriculture products.\u201d\u00a0 Steve Sapp, a public affairs officer with CBP, told us: It should also be noted that while the words \u201cpet food\u201d don\u2019t typically conjure up images of dead birds for those residing in the United States, this is a genuine pet food product sold in China. From what we can tell, this package contained \u201csmall freeze dried quail.\u201d While we haven\u2019t been able to find this specific brand of quail, we did find several similar pet food products:n\nClaim: A traveler from Beijing was caught at Dulles International Airport with a suitcase full of dead birds that the person tried to disguise as pet food. \nOptions:\n- true\n- not enough information\n- false\n\n- partially true and false\n\nPlease provide your reason.\n","gpt_ans":"mixture","explanation_gpt4":"The claim contains elements that are both true and false. It is true that a traveler from Beijing was caught at Dulles International Airport with dead birds, but these were in a single, sealed package declared as pet food, not a 'suitcase full' as the claim exaggerates. Additionally, there was no attempt to disguise the package as something else; the traveler declared it openly to customs officials. Therefore, while the traveler did have dead birds intended as pet food, the details about the quantity and the alleged disguise are incorrect."}

Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010. The title of his advertisement? \"\"Taliban Daniel Webster.\"\" The meat of the ad is a back-and-forth between a female narrator and Webster, speaking his own words. Here's the transcript:  Female narrator: (Speaking over images of terrorists holding guns and people burning the American flag) \"\"Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom in Afghanistan, in Iran and right here in Central Florida.\"\" Webster: (Black-and-white video, dressed in a suit, holding a microphone) \"\"Wives submit yourself to your own husband.\"\" Female narrator: \"\"Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us.\"\" Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL.

Hands off our bodies. And our laws.\"\" The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that \"\"Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands\"\" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: \"\"SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990).\"\" So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, \"\"creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery.\"\" Florida law currently allows married couples to\u00a0divorce if a court finds that the marriage is \"\"irretrievably broken.\"\" It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary \"\"covenant marriage.\"\" Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring:  \"\"I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me.\"\" The covenant marriage agreement \"\"may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery,\"\" according to the bill Webster filed. \"\"A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted,\"\" HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that \"\"no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife,\"\" but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the \"\"original\"\" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was \"\"significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.,\"\" Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad \"\"Taliban Dan Webster,\"\" Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce.

That campaign is funded by the Los Angeles-based nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers health services and is often at odds with the pharmaceutical industry. We wondered was its claim about Big Pharma true? Had a group of pharmaceutical companies really outspent all other ballot campaigns, combined? How much did all that spending add up to? We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It\u2019s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it\u2019s contributions came from 27 \"\"out-of-state pharmaceutical companies,\"\" as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer\u2019s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state\u2019s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America\u2019s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from\u00a01998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio \/ file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It\u2019s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it\u2019s not necessarily more that what\u2019s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It\u2019s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year\u2019s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what\u2019s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what\u2019s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle. What\u2019s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November\u2019s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. \"\"The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate,\"\" he said. \"\"When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings \u2026 you realize far more money has been raised.\"\" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year\u2019s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and \"\"missed\"\" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending \"\"is an early snapshot,\"\" noting it\u2019s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim \"\"ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October.\"\" Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot. In late March, it claimed: \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined.\"\" From our research, it\u2019s clear that 27 of the 30 companies backing Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure are, indeed, from outside California.

We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It\u2019s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it\u2019s contributions came from 27 \"\"out-of-state pharmaceutical companies,\"\" as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer\u2019s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state\u2019s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America\u2019s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from\u00a01998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio \/ file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It\u2019s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it\u2019s not necessarily more that what\u2019s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It\u2019s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year\u2019s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what\u2019s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what\u2019s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle. What\u2019s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November\u2019s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. \"\"The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate,\"\" he said. \"\"When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings \u2026 you realize far more money has been raised.\"\" He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year\u2019s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and \"\"missed\"\" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending \"\"is an early snapshot,\"\" noting it\u2019s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim \"\"ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October.\"\" Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot. In late March, it claimed: \"\"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined.\"\" From our research, it\u2019s clear that 27 of the 30 companies backing Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure are, indeed, from outside California. Together they\u2019ve amassed nearly $53 million, which dwarfs the $33 million spent on all other initiative campaigns during the 2015-2016 election cycle. But what\u2019s also clear is that Californians for Lower Drug Prices did not count a large pot of money, nearly $59\u00a0million, collected by a hospital association for a separate ballot measure. It says it simply \"\"missed\"\" these funds because it was focused on the current election cycle. Much of the $59 million\u00a0was contributed outside the timeframe used to make the claim, but it is money that was gathered to be spent on a November ballot measure. This doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that pharma firms have aggressively spent funds, so much that their totals already are in the top 20 for cash contributed for any California ballot measure. But the omission of the hospital association money leaves out important details that would give a different impression. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying efforts in 2015. The industry spent that total from 1998 through 2015. It spent $240 million in 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

The claim by Californians for Lower Drug Prices ignores the nearly $59 million collected by a hospital association for another ballot measure, which was raised over a longer timeframe and intended for the same November ballot. This significant amount was not included in their calculation, making their claim only partially true. The omission of these funds, which is a substantial portion of the total, leads to a misleading impression about the comparative scale of spending."}

Pat Toomey wants the president to reopen the economy, and in an interview with Politico, he said he sees clear signs that the country is ready \u2013 even as top public health officials studying the coronavirus warn against moving too quickly. \"\"In a matter of days, and in some cases the moment may even have passed, that we\u2019ve reached the peak of the rate of infections,\"\" said Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. We wondered whether the number of new cases reported each day has subsided and whether case counts are likely to stay down if the economy roars back to life like Toomey wants. Toomey is right that the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. has begun to stabilize. On Monday, states reported at least 1,500 new fatalities, a figure below last week\u2019s running tally of roughly 2,000 deaths every 24 hours. And the number of new cases reported Monday \u2013 about 23,000 \u2013 was also well below last week\u2019s trend of 30,000 to 50,000 new cases each day. These signs led a coalition of mostly Democratic governors on the east and west coasts to announce plans to coordinate the reopening of their economies. But even as they announced their pacts, the governors offered no timeline for ending the lockdowns that have kept the vast majority of more than 100 million residents of their states stuck at home. Toomey relied on a statement made last week by Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine when he made his claim about reaching the outbreak\u2019s peak, said Steve Kelly, a spokesman for the senator. Levine said she believes Pennsylvania has enough hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators to meet demand but that \"\"we\u2019re watching that data very closely.\"\" Data compiled by her department shows that 41 percent of hospital beds, 39 percent of ICU beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators across the state are still available, meaning Pennsylvania\u2019s health care system is not at risk of being overrun. This is what makes the senator believe it\u2019s time to reopen the economy in \"\"a gradual and safe way,\"\" Kelly said. Models created by a University of Washington global health research center indicate it\u2019s been five days since the use of hospital resources peaked nationwide. But these models don\u2019t account for the sort of relaxation of social distancing rules that Toomey and other Republicans are pushing for. Hospital capacity will be tested again once social distancing ends, and a new Washington Post analysis shows that in many parts of the country, including large swathes of Pennsylvania, it won\u2019t hold up. A team of Post reporters analyzed the availability of critical care resources across the country using data sets assembled by Definitive Healthcare, an analytics company that mines government filings, including those of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as commercial insurance claims. Imagining a scenario where the coronavirus infects two in 10 adults over the next year, the reporters found a patchwork of possible preparedness shortcomings in cities and towns where the full force of the virus has yet to hit and where people may not be following isolation and social distancing orders. The Post determined that more than half of the nation\u2019s population lives in areas that are less prepared for the virus than New York City, where in early April officials scrambled to add more ICU beds and find extra ventilators amid a surge or coronavirus patients. Parts of Pennsylvania that border Maryland and Ohio would fall especially short, the Post found.
