Second? Out of all the states in the union? Are Georgia kids really that hefty? Yes, we felt guilty. One PolitiFact Georgia reporter had spent a recent afternoon dressed as a witch, handing out fistfuls of sweets to trick-or-treaters. Childhood obesity can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol and other potentially deadly problems. It also places more burdens on the health care system. We called a spokeswoman for Children's Healthcare Atlanta, who pointed us to \"\"F as in Fat,\"\" a report issued by the Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit group that specializes in disease prevention. Sure enough, there Georgia was, second only to Mississippi in 2007 for obesity rates among 10- to 17-year-olds. In this state, 21.3 percent of children were obese, the report said. Mississippi's rate was 21.9 percent. The report defined an \"\"obese\"\" child as one with a body mass index greater than the 95th percentile for his age group. For instance, a 10-year-old boy with a height of 4 foot 6 inches and weighing 100 pounds would be obese. That's because his body mass index is 24.1, which is in the 97th percentile of his age group. Of the 10 states with the highest childhood obesity rates, nine were in the South, the report said. Children in Western states tended to be far more svelte. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest obesity rates were located in that region. The trust used figures from the National Survey of Children's Health, an effort funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The telephone survey asks parents for their children's ages, races, genders, weights and heights. Almost all the state-by-state rankings we found were based on data from that same survey. Understandably, they came up with similar results. The National Kids Count Program, run by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, used the same data to rank Georgia third in 2007. Its analysis ranked a slightly different group of kids: the number of children age 10-17 who are overweight as well as obese. Those are children whose body mass index is above the 85th percentile for their age and gender. A set of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided different results, but this survey was far from comparable. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System asks high school students in grades nine through 12 to report whether they are obese. The CDC does not rank states by high school obesity rates, but the data show that in 2009, 12.4 percent of Georgia high schoolers said they were obese. That's the 19th-highest of the states. But again, high schoolers report their own weight for this survey, and they might not be as accurate as their parents. The CDC does conduct a survey in which children are measured in person, but it doesn't break down the data by state. Why are Georgia's kids so heavy? We could locate no studies that answer that question, but there are some hints. The children who are at the highest risk for obesity are minorities or from rural areas, and they make up a large proportion of the state's child population, said Marsha Davis, a professor at the University of Georgia who studies childhood obesity. In rural areas, parents have trouble getting to supermarkets that sell fruits and vegetables. They end up feeding children with junk food they find at gas station convenience stores. For instance, the agricultural industry in South Georgia's Colquitt County ships produce across the country but sells very little locally, Davis said. The obesity rate there is extremely high. So while there is some variance in what surveys tell us, there's widespread agreement that Georgia kids are obese.

The randomized controlled study divided patients into groups with some receiving light therapy alone, some receiving light and antidepressant, and others received sham therapies imitating light and placebo medication. The most improvement was seen in the groups receiving light alone or light-plus-antidepressant. Paraphrasing the researchers, the story concludes that \u201cenough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression.\u201d But the story never really backs up that statement. It doesn\u2019t make the case for why this one rather small study puts the evidence squarely beyond doubt. Nor does it delve very deeply into the study\u2019s limitations. We would have welcomed more metrics and a clearer explanation for how this one study could change practice going forward. Major depression is the second-ranked cause of disability in the world, and estimates say it strikes 1 in 20 people in the United States. If light therapy, which is relatively low-cost, could improve the treatment of major depression it would help millions. It might also be an economic boon by helping relieve the lost wages and crippling disability of those who remain diminished for years.","premise":"The story squeaks by on this with mention that light therapy is \u201ccheap\u201d and easy to use.

{"claim_id":"3923","hypothesis":"Sorry, wrong number: Statistical benchmark comes under fire.","explanation_1":"Earlier this fall Dr. Scott Solomon presented the results of a huge heart drug study to an audience of fellow cardiologists in Paris.","premise":"The results Solomon was describing looked promising: Patients who took the medication had a lower rate of hospitalization and death than patients on a different drug. Then he showed his audience another number. \u201cThere were some gasps, or \u2018Ooohs,\u2019\u201d Solomon, of Harvard\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, recalled recently. \u201cA lot of people were disappointed.\u201d One investment analyst reacted by reducing his forecast for peak sales of the drug \u2014 by $1 billion. What happened? The number that caused the gasps was 0.059. The audience was looking for something under 0.05. What it meant was that Solomon\u2019s promising results had run afoul of a statistical concept you may never have heard of: statistical significance. It\u2019s an all-or-nothing thing. Your statistical results are either significant, meaning they are reliable, or not significant, indicating an unacceptably high chance that they were just a fluke. The concept has been used for decades. It holds a lot of sway over how scientific results are appraised, which studies get published, and what medicines make it to drugstores. But this year has brought two high-profile calls from critics, including from inside the arcane world of statistics, to get rid of it \u2014 in part out of concern that it prematurely dismisses results like Solomon\u2019s. Significance is reflected in a calculation that produces something called a p-value. Usually, if this produces a p-value of less than 0.05, the study findings are considered significant. If not, the study has failed the test. Solomon\u2019s study just missed. So the apparent edge his drug was showing over the other medication was deemed insignificant. By this criterion there was no \u201creal\u201d difference. Solomon believes the drug in fact produced a real benefit and that a larger or longer-lasting study could have reached statistical significance. \u201cI\u2019m not crying over spilled milk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do set the rules. The question is, is that the right way to go about it?\u201d He\u2019s not alone in asking that question. \u201cIt is a safe bet that people have suffered or died because scientists (and editors, regulators, journalists and others) have used significance tests to interpret results,\u201d epidemiologist Kenneth Rothman of RTI Health Solutions in Research Triangle Park, N.C., and Boston University wrote in 2016. The danger is both that a potentially beneficial medical finding can be ignored because a study doesn\u2019t reach statistical significance, and a harmful or fruitless medical practice could be accepted simply because it does, he said in an email. The p-value cutoff for significance Is \u201ca measure that has gained gatekeeper status ... not only for publication but for people to take your results seriously,\u201d says Northwestern University statistician Blake McShane. It\u2019s no wonder that a statistician, at a recent talk to journalists about the issue just before Halloween, displayed a slide of a jack-o\u2019-lantern carved with this sight, obviously terrifying to anyone in science or medicine: \u201cP = .06.\u201d McShane and others argue that the importance of the p-value threshold is undeserved. He co-authored a call to abolish the notion of statistical significance, which was published in the prestigious journal Nature this year. The proposal attracted more than 800 co-signers. Even the American Statistical Association, which had never issued any formal statement on specific statistical practices, came down hard in 2016 on using any kind of p-value cutoff in this way.

What it really represents is widely misunderstood, even by scientists and some statisticians, said Nicole Lazar, a statistics professor at the University of Georgia. \u2014 Using a label of statistical significance \u201cgives more certainty that is actually warranted,\u201d Lazar said. \u201cWe should recognize the fact that there is uncertainty in our findings.\u201d \u2014 The traditional cutoff of 0.05 is arbitrary. \u2014 Statistical significance does not necessarily mean \u201csignificant\u201d \u2014 or that a finding is important practically or scientifically, Lazar says. It might not even be true: Solomon cites a large heart drug study that found a significant treatment effect for patients born in August but not July, obviously just a random fluctuation. \u2014 The term \u201cstatistical significance\u201d sets up a goal line for researchers, a clear measure of success or failure. That means researchers can try a little bit too hard to reach it. They may deliberately game the system to get an acceptable p-value, or just unconsciously choose analytic methods that help, McShane and Lazar said. \u2014 That can distort the effects not only of individual experiments, but also the cumulative results of studies on a given topic, so that overall a drug can look \u201ca lot better than it actually is,\u201d McShane said. What should be done instead? Abolish the bright line of statistical significance, and just report the p-value along with other analyses to give a more comprehensive outline of what the test result may mean, McShane and others say.

Some experts believe the Geneva-based health agency is in a difficult position, having drawn fire in the past for acting either too quickly or too slowly. \u201cEssentially the WHO is between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity. Farrar noted that the organization was criticised for having called an early emergency in 2009 for the H1N1 flu pandemic, which proved mild, and then for being too late in declaring the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014.\", and claim \"WHO weighs science and politics in global virus emergency decision.\". Please explain why the claim is True.","explanation_llama":"The claim \"WHO weighs science and politics in global virus emergency decision\" is True because the article states that the WHO's decision is influenced by both scientific factors (e.g. human-to-human transmission outside of China) and political considerations (e.g. avoiding disrupting trade restrictions and not hurting host countries)."}

The fields were recently cleared of wheat and soybeans, and just one long row of cotton, which Shelton, 65, said he planted \u201cfor memory.\u201d  \u201cI wanted to say I planted cotton every year,\u201d said Shelton, who is black and whose property includes the 40 acres (16 hectares) his ancestors acquired in the late 19th century, not long after the abolition of slavery. With cotton prices near their lowest in six years, Shelton is far from alone in cutting back on the crop. U.S. farmers this year planted the fewest acres of cotton since 1983, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. In the southern states of Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas, once the heart of cotton country, growers expect to harvest some of their smallest crops since the year after the U.S. Civil War ended, according to the oldest government data available. It\u2019s not just low prices driving down cotton planting. This year marks the first the U.S. cotton farmers are getting by without a subsidy program that had long been the subject of a trade dispute between Washington and Brazil. For Shelton, the only one of eight siblings to go into farming, that is just the latest in a long line of hits his business has taken. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve found lately is it\u2019s become an expensive business,\u201d Shelton said. Many of the United States\u2019 remaining 18,000 cotton farms - a number that\u2019s fallen by half in less than 20 years - see themselves on the losing end of that long skirmish at the World Trade Organization. Washington paid $300 million to Brazil to settle the subsidy squabble and agreed to stop subsidy payment programs to cotton farms that totaled about $576 million in fiscal 2013, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. The farm law that passed last year phased out payments to farmers of many crops, leaving growers more exposed to market conditions.

That\u2019s gone with the wind.\u201d  It has left some farmers feeling exposed to low prices and the potential of rising debt levels, ultimately raising the prospect of further exodus from the fiber in areas where growers can grow food crops such as corn, wheat and soybeans. Don Shurley, a cotton economist with the University of Georgia said the problem was an economic one: \u201cCan cotton remain profitable to keep farmers growing it and stay in business?\u201d  With the price of cotton running at about 60 cents per pound, down 35 percent from 2014 highs, many farmers are finding it is costing them more to grow the crop than they earn. Falling demand has also taken a toll, with global consumption down 9 percent from a peak of 122.5 million bales nine years ago. The industry\u2019s most pervasive worry ultimately is not cost, but consumption. Cotton has struggled to recover demand lost amid price spikes in 2008, 2010, and 2011, which drove consumers towards clothes made of other fibers, such as polyester and nylon. Other Southern cotton farmers have coped with the long slide in prices by planting ever more acres, following the lead of their Midwestern counterparts who plant corn and wheat, and eke out slightly more profit from larger-scale operations.

{"claim_id":"34581","hypothesis":"An 86-year-old woman's severely  painful and curved back was cured by her practicing yoga for a month.","explanation_1":"Without contacting her personal doctor or seeing her medical records, it\u2019s hard to verify exactly what helped her overcome her back problem. Yoga seems to have played a positive role in her life, regardless of whether it was the cure, but doctors caution that it isn\u2019t for everyone and urge potential yogis to seek out professional medical care\u00a0and good instructors to ensure safety.","premise":"An August 2016 New York Post article reporting that an elderly New York woman got complete relief from a curved and painful back by doing one month of yoga has gone viral. But a spine surgeon told us it\u2019s unlikely yoga alone miraculously cured her. The 8 August 2016 account stated that 86-year-old Anna Pesce, the \u201cyoga grandma,\u201d now stands tall despite suffering from a herniated disc, scoliosis, and osteoporosis, and the feel-good premise has become popular on Facebook, prompting other news outlets to cover the story. The Post article said Pesce had lived with a hunched-over posture for decades, and in 2014 she experienced debilitating pain trying to climb a set of stairs that left her wheelchair-bound \u2014 until she discovered yoga: [Yoga instructor Rachel] Jesien visited Pesce in her home once a week, teaching her restorative poses and stretches such as child\u2019s pose and chair savasana, in which Pesce would rest her lower legs on a chair while lying on the floor with her knees slightly bent and a strap around her thighs. After one month of sessions, Pesce was able to walk again. But Dr. Nick Shamie, a spine surgeon and professor of orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery at the University of California at Los Angeles, told us that while practicing yoga has likely been good for Pesce\u2019s overall health, he can\u2019t credit it with healing her back: The reason people\u00a0get excited about this story is someone who was in severe pain, with one month of treatment, has had a complete return to normalcy\u00a0with something that is safe and enjoyable. But we need to be objective of our statements. Acute pain from a back injury, depending on the source and severity, often goes away with no more help than the body\u2019s natural ability to heal over time. Dr. Shamie said he himself practices yoga but stressed that while he generally considers it beneficial, people with back pain need to see a medical doctor before jumping into an exercise regimen: One needs to objectively look at her symptoms and try and correlate the symptom with a diagnosis \u2014 when did her pain start versus what medical conditions are acute. Then you have to see if yoga is an appropriate treatment\u00a0for that diagnosis. If someone has a fracture of the spine, the last thing you want to do is go and do a down dog. It\u2019s\u00a0not uncommon for patients and their loved ones to\u00a0mistake whatever course of action they\u2019ve taken to relieve their symptoms\u00a0as a miracle cure when it coincides with relief (even though the relationship isn\u2019t necessarily a causal one): Yoga, regular exercise, appropriate diet, regular and ample hours of sleep all have a positive effect on your sense of well being. But to say someone was suffering from three conditions, not know which was symptomatic and saying after yoga all three of them got better, I think it\u2019s a stretch. Notwithstanding that, I believe that yoga is definitely a great form of exercise and can certainly, if done correctly, with proper guidance and training, help with pain that many people\u00a0are suffering from regarding the spine and may even increase the longevity of your spine.

Dr. Jeffrey Wang, co-director of the Spine Center at the University of Southern California and professor of orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery, said yoga does help some of his patients \u2014 the regimen can help straighten out a hunched spine if the patient doesn\u2019t have a rigid deformity, which can only be corrected through surgery: There are people\u00a0that lean forward because their muscles are fatigued and tired. The bone isn\u2019t in that position, it\u2019s the muscles. If you strengthen the muscles you can get back your posture. The danger is that there are a lot of people\u00a0in her age group that have fixed deformities\u00a0that are not flexible.

If that is the case, it is possible yoga could have helped her strengthen core muscles and straighten out her back: You have someone who has a flexible deformity that had weak muscles and\u00a0got into a good exercise program and I think that\u2019s fantastic. Pesce\u2019s yoga instructor, Rachel Jesien, pointed out that she and other teachers she works with have developed a special yoga program to help people with scoliosis and other back problems.

{"claim_id":"34601","hypothesis":"Hanging plastic bags filled with water will repel flies.","explanation_1":"Will hanging plastic bags filled with water repel flies from your area? Opinion is divided on that technique's effectiveness.","premise":"In the same vein as the oft-asserted claim that leaving bottles of water on one\u2019s lawn will keep dogs from using that space as their personal lavatory is the belief that see-thru plastic bags filled with water and hung where flies can see them will keep those airborne pests at bay. Numerous folks swear by the practice, with restaurant operators from the Florida Keys to Texas numbering among that group. While the Internet-circulated how-to on repelling flies mandates the inclusion of four pennies in the bag, others who endorse the practice advocate placing only a single penny in each water-filled pouch, and others recommend using instead flakes of tin foil. However, the most common array of this sort is the unadorned bag of water, with such filled pouches to be either taped to one\u2019s doors or suspended in areas where flies are a particular problem. As to whether this method works, some swear by it, while others who have tried it assert that such preventives don\u2019t deter the flies one whit. Theories abound as to why such a practice might work. Some practitioners claim that flies perceive such bags as the surface of a large body of water and therefore avoid them. (This is a somewhat puzzling explanation, as flies are no strangers to ponds, puddles, lakes, and the like). Others maintain that the flies are scared off at seeing their own magnified reflections in the water bags. (Again, though, flies don\u2019t seem to shy away from other types of surfaces that reflect and\/or magnify their images.) The most common theory is that flies bases their sense of direction by where sunlight is coming from, and their complex eyes are overwhelmed and confused by the multi-directional refracted light produced by the bags, causing them to fly off rather than hang around. Science has yet to provide a definitive answer either way. In 2007, Mike Stringham, a North Carolina State University (NCSU) researcher, reported on his findings after spending 13 weeks studying the effects of water bags on flies at an egg-packing plant. After meticulously counting droppings left by flies on white \u201cspot cards,\u201d he concluded that the bags, rather than repelling the flying annoyances, actually attracted more of them. Said Stringham, \u201cIn the control room versus bags, the bags were consistently higher every time.\u201d  However, Stringham\u2019s study was conducted indoors under fluorescent and incandescent lighting, a factor which may limit its applicability: it\u2019s possible the effects of direct sunlight on the bags might produce a different result (as sunlight in outdoor environments varies and dances in ways that unwavering manmade sources of light do not). A December 2010 episode of Mythbusters found no significant difference between the number of flies attracted to a chamber holding both rotten meat and a plastic bag of water (without coins) and one which held only rotten meat. As with the NCSU experiment, however, the results might have been an artifact of the particular setup used rather than proof of a general truism. San Francisco Examiner columnist Richard Fagerlund (aka \u201cBugman\u201d) has tackled this question (in a decidedly unscientific way) several times over the course of years:  Q: At a Mississippi drive-in, I questioned the waitress about the bag of water over the door, thinking it might be a prank.

Was this yet another glimpse into the machinations of a \u201cbridezilla,\u201d a gal so caught up in the plans for her wedding that she turns into a monster? Or was it something else? Example: [Dear Abby, 2003] MEMO TO MY ATTENDANTS: Hey, girls! Mom has your dresses for the wedding. She\u2019ll bring them to the shower next weekend. You can pick them up there. Allison sent me an e-mail asking what style shoes and jewelry to wear. Great question, Allison! There are so many details. I keep forgetting to tell my girls what to do.This is an excellent opportunity to go over my expectations for each of you: About the shoes, please wear tasteful flats. Most of you are taller than me. I\u2019d rather you not all tower over me. I want all of you to wear your hair down. Since Babs and Allison have similar hair, I\u2019d prefer that Babs straighten hers and let Allison be the curly-haired girl. After all, she\u2019s my friend and you are just bridesmaids! I\u2019m sure you understand. Judy and Molly, you have both mentioned that you intend to shed a few pounds. This would be the perfect time! Watch your diets; we will all start weekly weigh-ins. Allison could use some trimming down, too. Also, you should all stay away from alcohol for at least a week before the wedding. None of us should be puffy or bloated. I think this is mainly for Babs, as none of my ladies drink all that much. Other than that, I don\u2019t have any real suggestions. Oh, please don\u2019t go tanning! I prefer to blend in with you than stand out as the pale one! Judy, Allison and Molly, please call me. There are a few other things that I need to go over with you on this topic. Babs, you are Scotty\u2019s friend, so I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell you what needs to be corrected \u2014 plus, your own wedding is coming up after mine. So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already more than a little aware of what you need to work on. See y\u2019all on Saturday. Babs, remember you\u2019ll attend the shower with us girls rather than the paintball fun with the boys. Dress accordingly, dear! Bridezilla tales are nothing new to the Internet, and usually after blossoming briefly to horrify the masses, they quietly fade into obscurity. This one, however, gained a shot in the arm when it appeared in a Dear Abby column in September 2002. Readers sent the much-traveled e-mail to Abby, seeking her comments. She offered no opinion on whether the story was true but replied: If the document you sent me is on the level, the bride-to-be appears to have an abundance of unresolved control issues and an astounding lack of tact. Abby\u2019s observation was dead on. It also brings us back to the \u201cwas this for real or not?\u201d element of the tale. You see, if this had been a hoax, it would have been designed to make its purported author look especially heinous. And there\u2019s a strong chance that\u2019s exactly what happened. A couple of small sections of the earlier e-mail were left out of the Dear Abby version, namely: [Following \u201cMost of you are taller than me, so would rather you all not tower over me\u2019] Plus, many of you are unaware, but Addie is terribly ill and sometimes is paralyzed from the waist down. And we do want to take care of Adam\u2019s girl! [Following \u201cLindsay could use some trimming up too\u201d] Addie, you just take care of yourself. I know that some of us have trouble with food and I don\u2019t want to encourage any bad habits with those who have had problems in the past. (In the February 2002 original, all the participants had different names: The curly-haired friend was Lindsay instead of Allison; Leisha and Sissy were the gals who needed to lose weight, not Judy and Molly; Addie, instead of Babs, was the paintball-loving two-fisted drinker who was soon to marry the problematic Adam, not Scotty; and the now-nameless bride signed herself as Jenny.) A careful reading of the original reveals little digs are made at Addie (Babs) throughout the piece. Granted, brides do not always get along famously with their bridesmaids, but this level of barely suppressed hostility is unusual. The unrelenting Addie-bashing should sound a few distant warning bells in those tempted to take the letter at face value, because the behavior doesn\u2019t fit the occasion. Addie drinks too much, has \u201cfood problems,\u201d is marrying a loser, is dead from the waist down, should have her hair straightened because another bridesmaid preferred by the bride also has curly hair, and has to be reminded to dress properly for the shower on Saturday to head off her turning up in shorts and a dirty T-shirt. The letter wasn\u2019t so much an \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding and here\u2019s how I want to run it\u201d missive as it was a bashing of one girl. Some mailings identified the bridezilla in question, so we asked her about it. She replied that while she\u2019d been made the goat of this affair, she hadn\u2019t written the letter; the piece had been the work of a disgruntled ex-boyfriend of Addie\u2019s. This fellow had somehow gained access to Addie\u2019s e-mail account, fabricated a letter supposedly written by the bride, and propagated it as if it were something Addie had received and was now forwarding to others. In this way, everyone in Addie\u2019s address book got to see all the little digs at her. Is this a reasonable scenario? In an oddball way it is \u2014 it certainly better explains the \u201cAddie bashing\u201d element of the letter than does the \u201cbitchy bride\u201d construct. Bridezillas are generally far too lost in what\u2019s going on with them to spare much attention for any member of the wedding party other than themselves. A true bridezilla would barely recognize that her bridesmaids had lives outside of the wedding, let alone be capable of diverting the focus of attention from herself to any of them. Jenny\u2019s explanation may be plausible, but since we can\u2019t prove the story one way or the other, we\u2019ll leave this one marked as \u201cUndetermined.\u201d The letter in question appeared in the May 2002 issue of Cosmopolitan as a sidebar to a larger article about bridezillas. All the names were changed once again. The current bridezilla tale echoes an older e-mail similarly transmitted across the Internet in 1999. Please note that the claims of this letter\u2019s having been penned in all seriousness by a real bride have not been substantiated, but the piece did run in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1991. Harper\u2019s presented it as: \u201cFrom a letter sent by a Youngstown, Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers in 1976. Since then, copies of the six-page, single-spaced letter have been circulating nationally among engaged and newlywed couples.\u201d EDITORS NOTE: This is an actual 1976 letter from a Youngstown,Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers. Read it and count your blessings. (FROM HARPER\u2019S MAGAZINE)Dear Bridal Party: From time to time I will be dropping everyone a line or two to keep each of you informed about how the wedding plans are progressing so that no one thinks I have forgotten them and no one is in the dark. Bridesmaids: Each bridesmaid will receive her dress via mail from Priscilla of Boston sometime in January. This will give each of you enough time to have the dress \u201cprofessionally\u201d altered if need be. The dresses are chiffon \u201cPriscilla\u201d dresses and can be worn after the wedding. The right shoulder is bare and there is no sleeve on the left arm. Each has its own cape, which goes almost to the floor. The two matrons of honor will be in silver and the four bridesmaids in peppermint green. As of this date, I have not decided whether the two in silver will wear green gloves and the four in green silver gloves, but long gloves will be worn. I strongly suggest that each person shops now for the typical cloth \u201cclosed-toe\u201d shoe. Keep the heel size reasonable \u2013 of course, no platforms of any kind. Anyone having trouble with their legs should wear support hose. Ushers: Each usher will be dressed identically to the groom, best man, and the head groomsman: black tails. Be sure you have black silk socks and black dress shoes polished to a high shine. Reception Rehearsal: On Saturday afternoon (early) we will go to Powers Auditorium to practice for the reception that night after the wedding ceremony. Why? Well, there is a long staircase at the auditorium that will be put to full use: Each bridal-party couple will be introduced separately and will proceed down the first half of the staircase (accompanied by music). Upon reaching the platform in the middle of the stairs, the girl will be required to \u201cswirl\u201d from the right side of the steps and move to the left side, and her partner (an usher) will move to the right; then they will proceed down the second half of the stairs and take their positions for the Bridal Dance. Dancing: I will try to find a choreographer to help with the Bridal Dance \u2014 but each person can please do his or her part by learning to waltz correctly in three-quarter time. Now, when I say waltz, I do not in any way mean two steps here and two steps there, always standing in one spot. When we waltz it will be to \u201cTales of the Vienna Woods.\u201d Each usher will be twirling his partner while moving in a large circle and maintaining even spacing between each couple. Turn on some old-time movies and you can see how it is supposed to be done. But, PLEASE, PLEASE, practice now! Suggestion: Go take dancing lessons!! That\u2019s what we have to do!! Also, there will be some polkas, the Charleston, jitterbug, and others. These are not \u201crequired\u201d dances. There will not be any up-to-date dances. I personally dislike them and think they look terrible-they simply are not dances, in my estimation. Photographs: There will be plenty. First and foremost, there will be \u201csound motion pictures\u201d taken throughout the wedding ceremony, during the Bridal Dance, and while each bridal-party couple walks down the steps at the reception. Flash pictures will be taken in the church ONLY until my father and I arrive at the altar-after that there will be NO flash pictures; the official photographer will be taking time exposures. I believe it is the height of ill manners for any guest to leave his or her seat and proceed to the altar to take pictures. Dress Requirements: Makeup \u2014 It is requested that you wear a little more than usual because of the photographs and the movie pictures. Any ladies with short eyelashes are requested to wear either false eyelashes or go to a beauty parlor and have false eyelashes put in one by one. The matrons of honor wearing the silver dresses must have a lot of pink in their makeup. That is straight from Priscilla. Be sure that each of the four other bridesmaids has green eyeshadow and that every one wears blusher, powder, eyebrow pencil, foundation, lipstick, and mascara \u2014 the works!! There will be two experts in the field of makeup to help anyone who needs it or wants it. As for the men, ho, ho, you will have your turn also. If you have a shiny face, be sure to use some of your wife\u2019s face powder to take the shine away. For the wives and husbands of those who are in the wedding party: Ladies-the color of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses has been stated, and all that I ask is that your dress be a color that will not contrast with the peppermint green, that it is of full length, and fairly simple in line. Also, please do not wear an extensive amount of jewelry, as the bridesmaids will possibly wear only small pearl earrings. Be sure each of you has gloves. You need wear nothing in your hair. Men \u2014 Amy Vanderbilt\u2019s book on etiquette says that anyone receiving a formal invitation is to wear \u201cblack tie,\u201d which means tuxedo. Now, this could get rather touchy, so I will put it this way: If you do not wish to wear a tux, or do not wish to take on the expense of renting one, it will be perfectly fine to wear a \u201cblack\u201d suit, white shirt with French cuffs, black silk socks, black shoes, and a black-and-silver tie. I hope this doesn\u2019t inconvenience too many, but I would hate to look at color pictures of the head table and see some men in black tails and others in brown or blue suits!! Children at the Wedding or Reception: It is my wish, and also Z.\u2019s [the fianc\u00e9], that there be no children at the wedding ceremony or at the reception. For purposes of clarification, a child is anyone eighteen years or younger. There are many reasons for this request, but the best is the simple fact that I don\u2019t have the money to invite children who only pick at their food, cry, run around, etc. One friend of mine, who married about a year ago, says that when she got her wedding pictures back, there wasn\u2019t one that didn\u2019t have a kid in it and she was disgusted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, children are great. But there is a time and a place for them and this isn\u2019t it. This is an adult, ultra-formal affair and I want to keep it that way. One point of etiquette: When a formal invitation is sent out with Mr. and Mrs. Paul J. Smith on the outside envelope and Mr. and Mrs. Smith on the inside envelope, that is exactly what it means \u2014 only Mr. and Mrs. Smith are being invited and no one else; no others in the family, no guests who might be visiting at the time, etc. If asked about guests, you can \u201cdiplomatically\u201d pass this on. I know it sounds like I am being a real fusspot, but I would hate to tell each of you what the cost is per person just for the reception alone. I\u2019m doing this for my friends and relatives, for all of us to have a good time, but since there are only so many hours in the day, and I already have three jobs, and I am not a Vanderbilt, some lines must be drawn, and I hope everyone understands. I\u2019ve never wanted a small country-type wedding \u2014 Z. says this is no wedding but rather a coronation!! Well, not quite. But it sure has been fun so far, and I just cannot wait for everyone to arrive and for all our friends and relatives to have one great, fabulous night. Everyone think positive and keep your fingers crossed. Pray \u2014 that will bring more help. Won\u2019t each of you come with Z. and me to fantasyland \u2014 a place where dreams come true and fun abounds for everyone? Where the bride is Cinderella and the groom is Cinderfella for an evening. You are going to attend a ball at \u201cBuckingham Palace\u201d (pretend) and the King and Queen have invited only \u201croyalty\u201d \u2014 YOU! This will be a time to remember when you were courting the person to whom you are now married-a time to take a second honeymoon. We want everyone to be as happy as we are and to rekindle (add extra \u201cfire\u201d to) their own marriages. If you have a happy marriage now (which I know you all do), we expect the Palace to be really electrified with all that LOVE. May your every dream come true!","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4864,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"We began seeing this intriguing letter in our inbox in February 2002, when countless readers began forwarding it to us to ask if it was the real thing. Was this yet another glimpse into the machinations of a \u201cbridezilla,\u201d a gal so caught up in the plans for her wedding that she turns into a monster? Or was it something else? Example: [Dear Abby, 2003] MEMO TO MY ATTENDANTS: Hey, girls! Mom has your dresses for the wedding. She\u2019ll bring them to the shower next weekend. You can pick them up there. Allison sent me an e-mail asking what style shoes and jewelry to wear. Great question, Allison! There are so many details. I keep forgetting to tell my girls what to do.This is an excellent opportunity to go over my expectations for each of you: About the shoes, please wear tasteful flats. Most of you are taller than me. I\u2019d rather you not all tower over me. I want all of you to wear your hair down. Since Babs and Allison have similar hair, I\u2019d prefer that Babs straighten hers and let Allison be the curly-haired girl. After all, she\u2019s my friend and you are just bridesmaids! I\u2019m sure you understand. Judy and Molly, you have both mentioned that you intend to shed a few pounds. This would be the perfect time! Watch your diets; we will all start weekly weigh-ins. Allison could use some trimming down, too. Also, you should all stay away from alcohol for at least a week before the wedding. None of us should be puffy or bloated. I think this is mainly for Babs, as none of my ladies drink all that much. Other than that, I don\u2019t have any real suggestions. Oh, please don\u2019t go tanning! I prefer to blend in with you than stand out as the pale one! Judy, Allison and Molly, please call me. There are a few other things that I need to go over with you on this topic. Babs, you are Scotty\u2019s friend, so I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell you what needs to be corrected \u2014 plus, your own wedding is coming up after mine. So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already more than a little aware of what you need to work on. See y\u2019all on Saturday. Babs, remember you\u2019ll attend the shower with us girls rather than the paintball fun with the boys. Dress accordingly, dear! Bridezilla tales are nothing new to the Internet, and usually after blossoming briefly to horrify the masses, they quietly fade into obscurity. This one, however, gained a shot in the arm when it appeared in a Dear Abby column in September 2002. Readers sent the much-traveled e-mail to Abby, seeking her comments. She offered no opinion on whether the story was true but replied: If the document you sent me is on the level, the bride-to-be appears to have an abundance of unresolved control issues and an astounding lack of tact. Abby\u2019s observation was dead on. It also brings us back to the \u201cwas this for real or not?\u201d element of the tale. You see, if this had been a hoax, it would have been designed to make its purported author look especially heinous. And there\u2019s a strong chance that\u2019s exactly what happened. A couple of small sections of the earlier e-mail were left out of the Dear Abby version, namely: [Following \u201cMost of you are taller than me, so would rather you all not tower over me\u2019] Plus, many of you are unaware, but Addie is terribly ill and sometimes is paralyzed from the waist down. And we do want to take care of Adam\u2019s girl! [Following \u201cLindsay could use some trimming up too\u201d] Addie, you just take care of yourself. I know that some of us have trouble with food and I don\u2019t want to encourage any bad habits with those who have had problems in the past. (In the February 2002 original, all the participants had different names: The curly-haired friend was Lindsay instead of Allison; Leisha and Sissy were the gals who needed to lose weight, not Judy and Molly; Addie, instead of Babs, was the paintball-loving two-fisted drinker who was soon to marry the problematic Adam, not Scotty; and the now-nameless bride signed herself as Jenny.) A careful reading of the original reveals little digs are made at Addie (Babs) throughout the piece. Granted, brides do not always get along famously with their bridesmaids, but this level of barely suppressed hostility is unusual. The unrelenting Addie-bashing should sound a few distant warning bells in those tempted to take the letter at face value, because the behavior doesn\u2019t fit the occasion. Addie drinks too much, has \u201cfood problems,\u201d is marrying a loser, is dead from the waist down, should have her hair straightened because another bridesmaid preferred by the bride also has curly hair, and has to be reminded to dress properly for the shower on Saturday to head off her turning up in shorts and a dirty T-shirt. The letter wasn\u2019t so much an \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding and here\u2019s how I want to run it\u201d missive as it was a bashing of one girl. Some mailings identified the bridezilla in question, so we asked her about it. She replied that while she\u2019d been made the goat of this affair, she hadn\u2019t written the letter; the piece had been the work of a disgruntled ex-boyfriend of Addie\u2019s. This fellow had somehow gained access to Addie\u2019s e-mail account, fabricated a letter supposedly written by the bride, and propagated it as if it were something Addie had received and was now forwarding to others. In this way, everyone in Addie\u2019s address book got to see all the little digs at her. Is this a reasonable scenario? In an oddball way it is \u2014 it certainly better explains the \u201cAddie bashing\u201d element of the letter than does the \u201cbitchy bride\u201d construct. Bridezillas are generally far too lost in what\u2019s going on with them to spare much attention for any member of the wedding party other than themselves. A true bridezilla would barely recognize that her bridesmaids had lives outside of the wedding, let alone be capable of diverting the focus of attention from herself to any of them. Jenny\u2019s explanation may be plausible, but since we can\u2019t prove the story one way or the other, we\u2019ll leave this one marked as \u201cUndetermined.\u201d The letter in question appeared in the May 2002 issue of Cosmopolitan as a sidebar to a larger article about bridezillas. All the names were changed once again. The current bridezilla tale echoes an older e-mail similarly transmitted across the Internet in 1999. Please note that the claims of this letter\u2019s having been penned in all seriousness by a real bride have not been substantiated, but the piece did run in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1991. Harper\u2019s presented it as: \u201cFrom a letter sent by a Youngstown, Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers in 1976. Since then, copies of the six-page, single-spaced letter have been circulating nationally among engaged and newlywed couples.\u201d EDITORS NOTE: This is an actual 1976 letter from a Youngstown,Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers. Read it and count your blessings. (FROM HARPER\u2019S MAGAZINE)Dear Bridal Party: From time to time I will be dropping everyone a line or two to keep each of you informed about how the wedding plans are progressing so that no one thinks I have forgotten them and no one is in the dark. Bridesmaids: Each bridesmaid will receive her dress via mail from Priscilla of Boston sometime in January. This will give each of you enough time to have the dress \u201cprofessionally\u201d altered if need be. The dresses are chiffon \u201cPriscilla\u201d dresses and can be worn after the wedding. The right shoulder is bare and there is no sleeve on the left arm. Each has its own cape, which goes almost to the floor. The two matrons of honor will be in silver and the four bridesmaids in peppermint green. As of this date, I have not decided whether the two in silver will wear green gloves and the four in green silver gloves, but long gloves will be worn. I strongly suggest that each person shops now for the typical cloth \u201cclosed-toe\u201d shoe. Keep the heel size reasonable \u2013 of course, no platforms of any kind. Anyone having trouble with their legs should wear support hose. Ushers: Each usher will be dressed identically to the groom, best man, and the head groomsman: black tails. Be sure you have black silk socks and black dress shoes polished to a high shine. Reception Rehearsal: On Saturday afternoon (early) we will go to Powers Auditorium to practice for the reception that night after the wedding ceremony. Why? Well, there is a long staircase at the auditorium that will be put to full use: Each bridal-party couple will be introduced separately and will proceed down the first half of the staircase (accompanied by music). Upon reaching the platform in the middle of the stairs, the girl will be required to \u201cswirl\u201d from the right side of the steps and move to the left side, and her partner (an usher) will move to the right; then they will proceed down the second half of the stairs and take their positions for the Bridal Dance. Dancing: I will try to find a choreographer to help with the Bridal Dance \u2014 but each person can please do his or her part by learning to waltz correctly in three-quarter time. Now, when I say waltz, I do not in any way mean two steps here and two steps there, always standing in one spot. When we waltz it will be to \u201cTales of the Vienna Woods.\u201d Each usher will be twirling his partner while moving in a large circle and maintaining even spacing between each couple. Turn on some old-time movies and you can see how it is supposed to be done. But, PLEASE, PLEASE, practice now! Suggestion: Go take dancing lessons!! That\u2019s what we have to do!! Also, there will be some polkas, the Charleston, jitterbug, and others. These are not \u201crequired\u201d dances. There will not be any up-to-date dances. I personally dislike them and think they look terrible-they simply are not dances, in my estimation. Photographs: There will be plenty. First and foremost, there will be \u201csound motion pictures\u201d taken throughout the wedding ceremony, during the Bridal Dance, and while each bridal-party couple walks down the steps at the reception. Flash pictures will be taken in the church ONLY until my father and I arrive at the altar-after that there will be NO flash pictures; the official photographer will be taking time exposures. I believe it is the height of ill manners for any guest to leave his or her seat and proceed to the altar to take pictures. Dress Requirements: Makeup \u2014 It is requested that you wear a little more than usual because of the photographs and the movie pictures. Any ladies with short eyelashes are requested to wear either false eyelashes or go to a beauty parlor and have false eyelashes put in one by one. The matrons of honor wearing the silver dresses must have a lot of pink in their makeup. That is straight from Priscilla. Be sure that each of the four other bridesmaids has green eyeshadow and that every one wears blusher, powder, eyebrow pencil, foundation, lipstick, and mascara \u2014 the works!! There will be two experts in the field of makeup to help anyone who needs it or wants it. As for the men, ho, ho, you will have your turn also. If you have a shiny face, be sure to use some of your wife\u2019s face powder to take the shine away. For the wives and husbands of those who are in the wedding party: Ladies-the color of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses has been stated, and all that I ask is that your dress be a color that will not contrast with the peppermint green, that it is of full length, and fairly simple in line. Also, please do not wear an extensive amount of jewelry, as the bridesmaids will possibly wear only small pearl earrings. Be sure each of you has gloves. You need wear nothing in your hair. Men \u2014 Amy Vanderbilt\u2019s book on etiquette says that anyone receiving a formal invitation is to wear \u201cblack tie,\u201d which means tuxedo. Now, this could get rather touchy, so I will put it this way: If you do not wish to wear a tux, or do not wish to take on the expense of renting one, it will be perfectly fine to wear a \u201cblack\u201d suit, white shirt with French cuffs, black silk socks, black shoes, and a black-and-silver tie. I hope this doesn\u2019t inconvenience too many, but I would hate to look at color pictures of the head table and see some men in black tails and others in brown or blue suits!!

{"claim_id":"36227","hypothesis":"Breastmilk effectively treats many conditions, including abrasions, cuts, insect bites, diaper rash, eczema, acne, and burns.","explanation_1":"Can You Use Breastmilk Topically to Treat Various Conditions?","premise":"In August 2018, a\u00a0post\u00a0from \u201cParents R Us\u201d about topical use of breastmilk to treat various conditions (archived here) appeared and has made the rounds online since, showing claims that have long been around in other forms as advice shared between parents:Underneath a photograph of a ziplock bag full of breastmilk in syringes, a post claimed:here are some facts for youDid you know that 1 drop of breastmilk has 1 million white blood cells? Original post by: Chelsea Leigh Ward You can use breastmilk topically to treat the following: Ear infections Some eye infections (Please note, never in the eye, but put it our around the eye) Bug bites Cuts Diaper rash Acne Eczema Burns CongestionThe list goes on and on, it\u2019s literally liquid gold! Here\u2019s my little life hack for when you need just a little bit of milk and don\u2019t want to thaw out an entire bag! **please consult your doctor to see if this is an option for you or your baby**After stating that \u201cone drop\u201d of breastmilk contains a million white blood cells, the post lists off a number of minor topical ailments for which the substance is supposedly an effective treatment. A slightly more specific but unsourced claim that one milliliter of breastmilk contains between one and five million \u201cwhite blood cells\u201d appears on two blogs, but is otherwise unsourced. Both Medela (a breastfeeding supply company) and a 2018 paper note that there are \u201cmillions\u201d of cells in breast milk (not in just\u00a0one drop), and that some are white blood cells.One study determined that the composition of breastmilk changes over time, concluding that it varies and depends on various intertwined issues, such as \u201cstage of lactation, the degree of breast fullness, infant feeding, the mother and infant health status, and many other factors and may be associated with the maternal diet and environment, and potentially with genetic factors.\u201d It cited concentrations well below the \u201cone to five million per drop\u201d estimate, though, with respect to a type of cell known as a leukocyte:The stage of lactation is associated with major changes in milk leukocyte composition . Using multicolor flow cytometry to identify and quantify leukocyte subsets in breast milk obtained from healthy women, Trend et al. found that colostrum contains approximately 146,000 cells\/ml and that the amount decreases in transitional (8\u201312 day postpartum) and mature milk (26\u201330 day postpartum) to 27,500 and 23,650 cells\/ml, respectively . They also demonstrated that breast milk contains a greater variety and complexity of leukocyte subsets than previously thought.Similar ranges were cited in a separate study. Colostrum, which is only expressed for a brief period after birth, was found to have far higher concentrations of such cells than transitional milk. A similar study in 2018 noted that ingested white cells did survive infants\u2019 gastric systems and remained active for up to six days.The broader post was about the use of breastmilk as a topical treatment. A 2018 Parents.com article about topical uses for breastmilk opens by claiming that the antibacterial properties of breastmilk have been proven, but it links to a study about ingested breastmilk rather than topical applications. When infection was mentioned in that research, it referred to breastfed infants and consumption of breastmilk.Parents.com\u2019s list of six topical uses for breastmilk cites a midwife and lactation consultant as its source, and both professions are known to recommend the use of breastmilk for ailments like maternal mastitis or cradle cap in infants. Of the six conditions mentioned in the article, only one (diaper rash) involved links to research. The site linked to a summary of a small study in 2015 finding breastmilk to be as efficient as hydrocortizone in treatment of diaper rash, and similar research supporting the same conclusion in 2013.The 2015 research found breastmilk to perform slightly better than ointment, and it cited earlier research on topical use of breastmilk for umbilical cord separation sites [PDF] as well as maternal mastitis:The frequency of healed infants was 81.5% and 76% in HBM and 1% hydrocortisone groups on day 21 respectively \u2026 Pishva et al. indicated the topical application of HBM as having beneficial effects on the prevention of neonatal conjunctivitis. Mohammadzadeh et al. showed the therapeutic effect of HBM and lanolin on sore nipples. HBM was found to heal nipples faster than using lanolin.Ahmadpour and his colleagues compared the effects of topical HBM to ethyl alcohol 96%, dry care, and silver sulfadiazine groups on the umbilical cord separation time. They showed that the mean cord separation time in the HBM group was significantly shorter than the other groups.A broader meta-study on the topical uses of breastmilk was published in May 2019. In its concluding paragraphs, researchers noted \u201cconsiderable\u00a0heterogeneity\u201d in the studies, meaning that their parameters were diverse enough to make it difficult to draw conclusions. They added that the most reliable clinical studies for assessing the benefits of breastmilk are \u201crandomized, double-blinded, multicenter controlled trials but to date, they are very scarce.\u201dIts authors also listed the pros for topical application of breastmilk (cost, convenience, and low risk of side effects) with the cons (poorly demonstrated efficacy as a whole) and a significant number of variables (conflicting outcomes and inconsistencies in breastmilk overall):Common skin problems may appear during lactation and breastfeeding, particularly affecting the nipple, areola, and breast. Some medications used in the treatment of skin conditions are unsuitable during lactation. It has been shown that expressing a few drops of milk and rubbing them gently into the sore nipples, then allowing it to dry naturally, takes advantage of the healing properties of human milk. Many studies have indicated that bioactive components of human milk and microbiota have promise as adjuvants for wound healing. From lesions of the corneal epithelium to lacerations of the skin, milk-treated groups healed faster than controls.Breast milk is used in many cultures for skin irritations. Breast milk involves no risk of allergy, contains antibodies, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and erythropoietin, which may promote the growth and repair of skin cells. Human milk is a source of commensal bacteria that can play an anti-infectious, immunomodulatory role. Their possible function in the acceleration of conditions for skin biofilm formation can open new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of skin and wound healing diseases.

Original post by: Chelsea Leigh Ward You can use breastmilk topically to treat the following: Ear infections Some eye infections (Please note, never in the eye, but put it our around the eye) Bug bites Cuts Diaper rash Acne Eczema Burns CongestionThe list goes on and on, it\u2019s literally liquid gold! Here\u2019s my little life hack for when you need just a little bit of milk and don\u2019t want to thaw out an entire bag! **please consult your doctor to see if this is an option for you or your baby**After stating that \u201cone drop\u201d of breastmilk contains a million white blood cells, the post lists off a number of minor topical ailments for which the substance is supposedly an effective treatment. A slightly more specific but unsourced claim that one milliliter of breastmilk contains between one and five million \u201cwhite blood cells\u201d appears on two blogs, but is otherwise unsourced. Both Medela (a breastfeeding supply company) and a 2018 paper note that there are \u201cmillions\u201d of cells in breast milk (not in just\u00a0one drop), and that some are white blood cells.One study determined that the composition of breastmilk changes over time, concluding that it varies and depends on various intertwined issues, such as \u201cstage of lactation, the degree of breast fullness, infant feeding, the mother and infant health status, and many other factors and may be associated with the maternal diet and environment, and potentially with genetic factors.\u201d It cited concentrations well below the \u201cone to five million per drop\u201d estimate, though, with respect to a type of cell known as a leukocyte:The stage of lactation is associated with major changes in milk leukocyte composition . Using multicolor flow cytometry to identify and quantify leukocyte subsets in breast milk obtained from healthy women, Trend et al. found that colostrum contains approximately 146,000 cells\/ml and that the amount decreases in transitional (8\u201312 day postpartum) and mature milk (26\u201330 day postpartum) to 27,500 and 23,650 cells\/ml, respectively . They also demonstrated that breast milk contains a greater variety and complexity of leukocyte subsets than previously thought.Similar ranges were cited in a separate study. Colostrum, which is only expressed for a brief period after birth, was found to have far higher concentrations of such cells than transitional milk. A similar study in 2018 noted that ingested white cells did survive infants\u2019 gastric systems and remained active for up to six days.The broader post was about the use of breastmilk as a topical treatment. A 2018 Parents.com article about topical uses for breastmilk opens by claiming that the antibacterial properties of breastmilk have been proven, but it links to a study about ingested breastmilk rather than topical applications. When infection was mentioned in that research, it referred to breastfed infants and consumption of breastmilk.Parents.com\u2019s list of six topical uses for breastmilk cites a midwife and lactation consultant as its source, and both professions are known to recommend the use of breastmilk for ailments like maternal mastitis or cradle cap in infants. Of the six conditions mentioned in the article, only one (diaper rash) involved links to research. The site linked to a summary of a small study in 2015 finding breastmilk to be as efficient as hydrocortizone in treatment of diaper rash, and similar research supporting the same conclusion in 2013.The 2015 research found breastmilk to perform slightly better than ointment, and it cited earlier research on topical use of breastmilk for umbilical cord separation sites [PDF] as well as maternal mastitis:The frequency of healed infants was 81.5% and 76% in HBM and 1% hydrocortisone groups on day 21 respectively \u2026 Pishva et al. indicated the topical application of HBM as having beneficial effects on the prevention of neonatal conjunctivitis. Mohammadzadeh et al. showed the therapeutic effect of HBM and lanolin on sore nipples. HBM was found to heal nipples faster than using lanolin.Ahmadpour and his colleagues compared the effects of topical HBM to ethyl alcohol 96%, dry care, and silver sulfadiazine groups on the umbilical cord separation time. They showed that the mean cord separation time in the HBM group was significantly shorter than the other groups.A broader meta-study on the topical uses of breastmilk was published in May 2019. In its concluding paragraphs, researchers noted \u201cconsiderable\u00a0heterogeneity\u201d in the studies, meaning that their parameters were diverse enough to make it difficult to draw conclusions. They added that the most reliable clinical studies for assessing the benefits of breastmilk are \u201crandomized, double-blinded, multicenter controlled trials but to date, they are very scarce.\u201dIts authors also listed the pros for topical application of breastmilk (cost, convenience, and low risk of side effects) with the cons (poorly demonstrated efficacy as a whole) and a significant number of variables (conflicting outcomes and inconsistencies in breastmilk overall):Common skin problems may appear during lactation and breastfeeding, particularly affecting the nipple, areola, and breast. Some medications used in the treatment of skin conditions are unsuitable during lactation. It has been shown that expressing a few drops of milk and rubbing them gently into the sore nipples, then allowing it to dry naturally, takes advantage of the healing properties of human milk. Many studies have indicated that bioactive components of human milk and microbiota have promise as adjuvants for wound healing. From lesions of the corneal epithelium to lacerations of the skin, milk-treated groups healed faster than controls.Breast milk is used in many cultures for skin irritations. Breast milk involves no risk of allergy, contains antibodies, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and erythropoietin, which may promote the growth and repair of skin cells. Human milk is a source of commensal bacteria that can play an anti-infectious, immunomodulatory role. Their possible function in the acceleration of conditions for skin biofilm formation can open new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of skin and wound healing diseases. Interestingly, the analysis of Simpson et al. showed that miRNAs are possible mediators of the observed preventative effects of atopic dermatitis.The concentration, regulation, and individual variation between bioactive element, immune factors, various progenitor and mature cell types, and stage of lactation are not well established.

The post claimed a profound link between the trauma Stewart suffered from flying 20 combat missions over Germany and his ability to immerse himself in the role of George Bailey, the melancholic protagonist of the classic American film (and holiday favorite) \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d On Dec. 22, 2018, Ned Forney \u2014 a writer who devotes his Facebook page to personal histories and tributes to many U.S. military service members \u2014 posted one such account of Stewart\u2019s patriotism and dedication, and the emotional scars he bore from his sacrifice: For all the fans of \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life\u201d and Jimmy Stewart \u2026 Just months after winning his 1941 Academy Award for best actor in \u201cThe Philadelphia Story,\u201d Jimmy Stewart, one of the best-known actors of the day, left Hollywood and joined the US Army. He was the first big-name movie star to enlist in World War II. An accomplished private pilot, the 33-year-old Hollywood icon became a US Army Air Force aviator, earning his 2nd Lieutenant commission in early 1942. With his celebrity status and huge popularity with the American public, he was assigned to starring in recruiting films, attending rallies, and training younger pilots. Stewart, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. He wanted to fly combat missions in Europe, not spend time in a stateside training command. By 1944, frustrated and feeling the war was passing him by, he asked his commanding officer to transfer him to a unit deploying to Europe. His request was reluctantly granted. Stewart, now a Captain, was sent to England, where he spent the next 18 months flying B-24 Liberator bombers over Germany. Throughout his time overseas, the US Army Air Corps\u2019 top brass had tried to keep the popular movie star from flying over enemy territory. But Stewart would hear nothing of it. Determined to lead by example, he bucked the system, assigning himself to every combat mission he could. By the end of the war he was one of the most respected and decorated pilots in his unit. But his wartime service came at a high personal price. In the final months of WWII he was grounded for being \u201cflak happy,\u201d today called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). When he returned to the US in August 1945, Stewart was a changed man. He had lost so much weight that he looked sickly. He rarely slept, and when he did he had nightmares of planes exploding and men falling through the air screaming (in one mission alone his unit had lost 13 planes and 130 men, most of whom he knew personally). He was depressed, couldn\u2019t focus, and refused to talk to anyone about his war experiences. His acting career was all but over. As one of Stewart\u2019s biographers put it, \u201cEvery decision he made [during the war] was going to preserve life or cost lives. He took back to Hollywood all the stress that he had built up.\u201d In 1946 he got his break. He took the role of George Bailey, the suicidal father in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d The rest is history. Actors and crew of the set realized that in many of the disturbing scenes of George Bailey unraveling in front of his family, Stewart wasn\u2019t acting. His PTSD was being captured on filmed for potentially millions to see. But despite Stewart\u2019s inner turmoil, making the movie was therapeutic for the combat veteran. He would go on to become one of the most accomplished and loved actors in American history. When asked in 1941 why he wanted to leave his acting career to fly combat missions over Nazi Germany, he said, \u201cThis country\u2019s conscience is bigger than all the studios in Hollywood put together, and the time will come when we\u2019ll have to fight.\u201d This weekend, as many of us watch the classic Christmas film, \u201cIt\u2019s A Wonderful Life,\u201d it\u2019s also a fitting time to remember the sacrifices of Jimmy Stewart and all the men who gave up so much to serve their country during wartime. We will always remember you! Postscript: While fighting in Europe, Stewart\u2019s Oscar statue was proudly displayed in his father\u2019s Pennsylvania hardware store. Throughout his life, the beloved actor always said his father, a World War I veteran, was the person who had made the biggest impact on him. Jimmy Stewart was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and died in 1997 at the age of 89. It\u2019s a stirring account, and one firmly rooted in an accurate presentation of the basic sequence of events of Stewart\u2019s involvement in World War II. However, elements of the story \u2014 the claim that Stewart was removed from flying missions over Germany because he suffered from PTSD, and descriptions of him suffering nightmares of \u201cmen falling through the air screaming\u201d \u2014 appear to be rather thinly sourced and not corroborated in other accounts of the actor\u2019s military service. The version of events presented in the meme appears to have borrowed heavily from a 2016 book by the nonfiction writer Robert Matzen, called \u201cMission: Jimmy Stewart and the Fight for Europe.\u201d The book charted Stewart\u2019s early career as an actor, his friendships and relationships, his family\u2019s history of military service, his famously close and affectionate bond with his father, and his entry into military service during World War II. However, the book attracted attention in the media for the revelatory claim that Stewart had suffered from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD, as a result of the horrors of flying 20 bombing missions over Germany, to such an extent that Stewart had to withdraw from combat missions, and that his trauma was visible to those on the set of \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d Here\u2019s what Matzen wrote in the book itself about Stewart\u2019s state of mind after returning to Hollywood from the war: Jim Stewart was a man at sea, untethered by his old employer, yet also away from the regimentation of the service, the adrenalin rush, the striving toward great accomplishments, and the defying of odds with an extraordinary collection of brothers in arms who had become like sons to him. Combat fatigue and shell shock were the terms of the day for what eventually became known as post-traumatic stress disorder, but whatever the name, Stewart suffered along with millions of other combat veterans who had returned to homes the world over, to friends and family who just couldn\u2019t understand what they had experienced. On several occasions throughout the book, Matzen described Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d a World War II-era phrase for symptoms of anxiety, sleeplessness, nightmares, and so on, which would now likely be diagnosed as PTSD. In one instance, he cited an interview he conducted with Lt. Barry Shillito, a fellow pilot and contemporary of Stewart\u2019s, as follows: \u201c\u2026 Shillito was shocked at the change in his old squadron commander. Stewart was gray of face, with bags under his eyes and a furrowed brow. His full head of hair had begun to recede and was half silver. Jim had grown so thin that the skin hung from his neck. It was almost as if Jim Stewart had been imprisoned like the others. \u2018He went flak happy there for a while,\u2019 said Shillito. \u2018He wasn\u2019t flying anymore and he was quieter than I remembered. '\u201d The specific claim that Stewart had suffered nightmares about \u201cplanes exploding and men falling through the air screaming\u201d appears to be of dubious origins. It comes from the prologue of Matzen\u2019s book, which is in several places written in an impressionistic style, mixing third-person narration with first-person, stream-of-consciousness prose, the latter a style that does not lend itself well to source-checking. The book reads: \u201cIn every newspaper, in every magazine were stories about families who didn\u2019t recognize the boys who had come home. This isn\u2019t my son. This isn\u2019t my husband; this isn\u2019t my brother. He\u2019s so cold, so distant, and the rages, the nightmares! \u201cOh yes, the nightmares came every night. There he was on oxygen at 20,000 feet with 190s zipping past, spraying lead and firing rockets, flak bursting about the cockpit. B-24s hit, burning, spinning out of formation. Bail out! Do you see any chutes? How many chutes? Whose ship was it? Oh no, not him! Not them! Bodies, pieces of bodies smacking off the windshield \u2026\u201d In the chapter notes, Matzen wrote the following about the sourcing for the prologue: \u201cThe prologue was written last and drew upon all the research that came before. I interviewed dozens of Armed Services personnel about the experience of coming home from wartime and their feelings of unreality and disconnectedness from friends, family and co-workers who couldn\u2019t possibly understand what had happened overseas.\u201d It\u2019s perfectly plausible that Stewart, who led and took part in multiple bombing missions, might have experienced nightmares or had traumatic memories of those difficult experiences. However, the \u201cexploding planes\u201d claim serves as a useful warning about describing what might be a general impression of the collective experience of World War II aviators as a specific experience that Stewart himself personally had. The Facebook post\u2019s claim that Stewart was \u201cgrounded for being \u2018flak happy'\u201d is also factually dubious. The broader assertion that Stewart had to fight to be allowed to fly combat missions, and play a more active part in the war, is fully corroborated in two other sources that we consulted: \u201cJimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind the Legend,\u201d a book by the film historian Michael Munn; and \u201cJimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot,\u201d a book by Starr Smith, an author and journalist who worked alongside Stewart as an Eighth Air Force intelligence officer during World War II. According to all three sources, the \u201chigher-ups\u201d within the U.S. military preferred to deploy Stewart\u2019s fame and widespread respect among the American population by using him for propaganda purposes, morale-raising exercises, and to encourage other young men to enlist. However, Stewart was persistent in requesting combat missions, and was eventually stationed in England where he led or took part in 20 bombing missions over Germany. Neither Munn nor Smith\u2019s accounts describe Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d \u201cshell-shocked,\u201d or suffering from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD. Neither account describes any nightmares or obvious trauma on Stewart\u2019s part, in detail, and neither book ascribes his supposed condition as the reason he was withdrawn from combat missions towards the end of the war. Rather, according to Smith, Stewart was promoted and moved in the spring of 1944, as part of what Smith describes in his book as a natural progression in his military career, given his frequently commended performance as a bomber pilot and squadron leader:\u00a0 \u201c\u2026 Toward the end of March [1944], the news came: Major Stewart had been promoted. After flying twelve missions with the 445th Group and commanding the 703rd Squadron, he was leaving to become the operations officer of the 453rd Group, at Attleborough, or Old Buc \u2026 When the appointment was announced, nothing was said about \u201cflying too many missions.\u201d The official word was that the 453rd needed an operations officer, and Major Stewart had been promoted to the job. I was then a combat intelligence officer with the 453rd, and met Stewart for the first time upon his arrival at Old Buc \u2026 Since then, I have been asked many times about it. I must say that I think it highly unlikely that Stewart\u2019s mission schedule and high command\u2019s efforts to \u201cprotect\u201d him had any bearing on his transfer and promotion.\u201d Smith speculates, in the book, that Col. Bob Terrill, with whom Stewart had a close affinity, might have lobbied for the transfer, but otherwise describes it as \u201ca routine air force change of assignment,\u201d adding: \u201cStewart was a mature, knowledgeable and experienced air force officer with an operational and administrative background. And a stellar combat record. He knew the territory. In short, he was ready for promotion. And deserved it.\u201d","label":1,"__index_level_0__":1818,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"In late 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of a viral Facebook post that presented an account of the actor Jimmy Stewart\u2019s military service during World War II.

The Facebook post\u2019s claim that Stewart was \u201cgrounded for being \u2018flak happy'\u201d is also factually dubious. The broader assertion that Stewart had to fight to be allowed to fly combat missions, and play a more active part in the war, is fully corroborated in two other sources that we consulted: \u201cJimmy Stewart: The Truth Behind the Legend,\u201d a book by the film historian Michael Munn; and \u201cJimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot,\u201d a book by Starr Smith, an author and journalist who worked alongside Stewart as an Eighth Air Force intelligence officer during World War II. According to all three sources, the \u201chigher-ups\u201d within the U.S. military preferred to deploy Stewart\u2019s fame and widespread respect among the American population by using him for propaganda purposes, morale-raising exercises, and to encourage other young men to enlist. However, Stewart was persistent in requesting combat missions, and was eventually stationed in England where he led or took part in 20 bombing missions over Germany. Neither Munn nor Smith\u2019s accounts describe Stewart as \u201cflak happy,\u201d \u201cshell-shocked,\u201d or suffering from what would now be diagnosed as PTSD. Neither account describes any nightmares or obvious trauma on Stewart\u2019s part, in detail, and neither book ascribes his supposed condition as the reason he was withdrawn from combat missions towards the end of the war. Rather, according to Smith, Stewart was promoted and moved in the spring of 1944, as part of what Smith describes in his book as a natural progression in his military career, given his frequently commended performance as a bomber pilot and squadron leader:\u00a0 \u201c\u2026 Toward the end of March [1944], the news came: Major Stewart had been promoted. After flying twelve missions with the 445th Group and commanding the 703rd Squadron, he was leaving to become the operations officer of the 453rd Group, at Attleborough, or Old Buc \u2026 When the appointment was announced, nothing was said about \u201cflying too many missions.\u201d The official word was that the 453rd needed an operations officer, and Major Stewart had been promoted to the job. I was then a combat intelligence officer with the 453rd, and met Stewart for the first time upon his arrival at Old Buc \u2026 Since then, I have been asked many times about it. I must say that I think it highly unlikely that Stewart\u2019s mission schedule and high command\u2019s efforts to \u201cprotect\u201d him had any bearing on his transfer and promotion.\u201d Smith speculates, in the book, that Col. Bob Terrill, with whom Stewart had a close affinity, might have lobbied for the transfer, but otherwise describes it as \u201ca routine air force change of assignment,\u201d adding: \u201cStewart was a mature, knowledgeable and experienced air force officer with an operational and administrative background. And a stellar combat record. He knew the territory. In short, he was ready for promotion. And deserved it.\u201d\", and claim \"Actor Jimmy Stewart suffered what would in 2019 be diagnosed as PTSD due to his experience as a World War II bomber pilot.\".

Still more commenters referenced the number of deaths from lack of affordable healthcare, a topic we have covered in depth, and at least one person mentioned the five Americans killed by lettuce in 2018:No, he\u2019s not kidding https:\/\/t.co\/xONyOBKvC2\u2014 Hutaff Hillside (@LucasHaskins) January 2, 2019The first statistic referenced \u2014 40,000 Americans purportedly killed by firearms in 2018 \u2014 is data typically obtained for the purpose of fact-checking from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual morbidity and mortality reports. The tool used, wonder.cdc.gov, includes data up to the year 2017 as of early January 2019.In lieu of those figures, we averaged all firearm-related deaths for the ten-year period\u00a0 between 2007 and 2017. The number returned by the CDC tool was 373,663, averaging 37,366 a year:That figure rounded up would yield 40,000. However, CDC mortality statistics for 2018 would not be available for several months as of January 2019.The CDC also provided statistics for multiple causes of death from to buses, lawnmowers, and lightning:Between 2007 and 2017, we found that 13,277 Americans were killed in incidents involving a bus, or approximately 1,328 annually; 9,051 Americans were killed by falling out of bed, or 905 a year. Lawnmowers resulted in the deaths of 846 Americans that decade, or about 85 each year, and 317 Americans died in lightning strikes, about 32 annually.The final three causes of death were more difficult to pin down: armed toddlers, white supremacists, and Muslim extremists. The latter two fell into the realm of \u201chomicide,\u201d figures typically obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The former, toddlers discharging firearms, did not seem to be available through any centralized database.The tweet attributed 20 deaths in 2018 to armed toddlers, but we were unable to locate the source of that number. Christopher Ingraham\u2019s October 2015\u00a0Washington Post piece \u201cPeople are getting shot by toddlers on a weekly basis this year\u201d often formed the basis of \u201carmed toddler\u201d claims, but in those figures, 13 toddlers killed themselves and two killed other people, for a total of fifteen. Ingraham maintained detailed data about to shooting deaths in the United States for his work, but we found nothing offering information for toddler-involved shootings in 2018.Statistics maintained by gun control advocacy group Everytown for 2018 counted\u00a0\u201cat least\u201d 204 unintentional shootings by children in 2018. The group referenced \u201cmedia reports to identify shootings in which a person age 17 or under unintentionally fires a gun and harms themselves or someone else,\u201d but the figures provided by Everytown were not restricted to toddlers. The group included the age of the victim of the shootings, but not the age of the child who discharged the weapon.For the \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d cause of death cited by Rashid, once again there was no real cohesive data from which to obtain a solid figure (although related claims remained popular). The only widely-cited related report we could find originated with Jewish non-governmental organization the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in, which provided its own figures\u00a0for 2017:White supremacists were \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for 18 out of 34 U.S. extremist-related deaths in 2017, the ADL said.

Still more commenters referenced the number of deaths from lack of affordable healthcare, a topic we have covered in depth, and at least one person mentioned the five Americans killed by lettuce in 2018:No, he\u2019s not kidding https:\/\/t.co\/xONyOBKvC2\u2014 Hutaff Hillside (@LucasHaskins) January 2, 2019The first statistic referenced \u2014 40,000 Americans purportedly killed by firearms in 2018 \u2014 is data typically obtained for the purpose of fact-checking from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s annual morbidity and mortality reports. The tool used, wonder.cdc.gov, includes data up to the year 2017 as of early January 2019.In lieu of those figures, we averaged all firearm-related deaths for the ten-year period\u00a0 between 2007 and 2017. The number returned by the CDC tool was 373,663, averaging 37,366 a year:That figure rounded up would yield 40,000. However, CDC mortality statistics for 2018 would not be available for several months as of January 2019.The CDC also provided statistics for multiple causes of death from to buses, lawnmowers, and lightning:Between 2007 and 2017, we found that 13,277 Americans were killed in incidents involving a bus, or approximately 1,328 annually; 9,051 Americans were killed by falling out of bed, or 905 a year. Lawnmowers resulted in the deaths of 846 Americans that decade, or about 85 each year, and 317 Americans died in lightning strikes, about 32 annually.The final three causes of death were more difficult to pin down: armed toddlers, white supremacists, and Muslim extremists. The latter two fell into the realm of \u201chomicide,\u201d figures typically obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The former, toddlers discharging firearms, did not seem to be available through any centralized database.The tweet attributed 20 deaths in 2018 to armed toddlers, but we were unable to locate the source of that number. Christopher Ingraham\u2019s October 2015\u00a0Washington Post piece \u201cPeople are getting shot by toddlers on a weekly basis this year\u201d often formed the basis of \u201carmed toddler\u201d claims, but in those figures, 13 toddlers killed themselves and two killed other people, for a total of fifteen. Ingraham maintained detailed data about to shooting deaths in the United States for his work, but we found nothing offering information for toddler-involved shootings in 2018.Statistics maintained by gun control advocacy group Everytown for 2018 counted\u00a0\u201cat least\u201d 204 unintentional shootings by children in 2018. The group referenced \u201cmedia reports to identify shootings in which a person age 17 or under unintentionally fires a gun and harms themselves or someone else,\u201d but the figures provided by Everytown were not restricted to toddlers. The group included the age of the victim of the shootings, but not the age of the child who discharged the weapon.For the \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d cause of death cited by Rashid, once again there was no real cohesive data from which to obtain a solid figure (although related claims remained popular). The only widely-cited related report we could find originated with Jewish non-governmental organization the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in, which provided its own figures\u00a0for 2017:White supremacists were \u201cdirectly responsible\u201d for 18 out of 34 U.S. extremist-related deaths in 2017, the ADL said.

The project has drawn protesters from more than 300 indigenous tribes from across the Americas, as well as non-native demonstrators such as the Bronx woman at risk of losing her arm from what activists have described as a police-thrown concussion grenade. A disclosure made a year earlier showed that Trump owned between $500,000 and $1 million in Energy Transfer Partners stock at that time. On 25 November 2016, CBS reported\u00a0that additional stock owned by Trump exacerbated the conflict: Trump\u2019s 2016 federal disclosure forms show he owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. That\u2019s down from between $500,000 and $1 million a year earlier. Trump also owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in Phillips 66, which has a one-quarter share of Dakota Access.

{"claim_id":"34688","hypothesis":"A kitten died after ingesting a chemical sprayed on a Home Depot Christmas tree.","explanation_1":"Did a kitten die after ingesting chemicals sprayed on a Home Depot Christmas tree?","premise":"On 10 December 2014, the Facebook page Forever Home Cat Rescue published a warning about an Ontario family who claimed their kitten (named Luna) became ill and died due to ingesting a chemical (ethylene glycol) that had been sprayed on a Christmas tree they had purchased at a Canadian Home Depot location: [Kim] Coates called Home Depot in a panic. She says the store told her the trees are sprayed with \u201ca hypoallergenic pet-friendly substance akin to house paint.\u201dAfter speaking with Home Depot, Coates says the supplier provided her veterinarian with a list of ingredients in the spray, one of which is ethylene glycol. Coates put the tree outside and Home Depot came to pick it up. This is the same chemical found in antifreeze and is highly toxic to animals, which are drawn by its sweet taste. Example: \u00a0 [Collected via Facebook, December 2014] URGENT!!! We just received a horrifying call from an adopter whose kitten Licorice died this morning of Ethylene Glycol poisoning after ingesting a Christmas tree needle from a tree purchased at Home Depot. Apparently, ALL Christmas trees from Home Depot are sprayed with this material found in ANTI-FREEZE! This has been verified through Home Depot Corporate and the veterinary office that tried to save the kitten\u2019s life.Please keep this family (with four devastated children) in your thoughts tonight. One little girl thinks it\u2019s her fault, because she picked out the tree. The initial warning about Home Depot Christmas trees was quite vague and relayed a difficult-to-understand chain of events, and the cat\u2019s death occurred on the same day the warning was posted, leaving readers unclear about how much of the claim (if any) had been verified. On 11 December 2014, the CBC published an article about the death of Luna and the warning concerning Home Depot Christmas trees: A Stoney Creek, Ont., family adopted a black kitten named Luna from the cat rescue group called Forever Home.The family brought home a Christmas tree from Home Depot after taking the kitten home. They said the feline ingested pine needles and later died. A veterinarian informed the family the cause of death was poisoning from ethylene glycol, extremely toxic to cats. While the cat\u2019s untimely death is sad, the composition of the tree is only one component of the warning circulating on animal advocacy pages; another is the timeline: according to Luna\u2019s owners, the kitten became ill on 9 December 2014 and died the next day. That same day the warning about Home Depot Christmas trees was posted to social media, leaving little time for the circumstances of the kitten\u2019s death to be fully investigated. If the warning were to be taken at face value, a comprehensive necropsy confirming ethylene glycol toxicity and test of the tree definitively determining the latter as the source of the toxin would had to have occurred inside the space of only a few hours. (Quite possibly the cat ingested something harmful that was present in the household somewhere other than on the branches of the family\u2019s newly purchased Christmas tree.) Home Depot\u2019s official Facebook account posted a reply to the thread on 10 December 2014, and their response addressed another consideration: Whether or not cut Christmas trees are frequently sprayed with artificial snow, many trees are sold from at given Home Depot location, but even though some of those trees go to homes where cats reside, there has not been a reported rash of cat poisonings due to the use of artificial snow on cut Christmas trees: We take all of our customer issues seriously and are actively working with the customer, our merchants and vendors to investigate the situation.

She says the store told her the trees are sprayed with \u201ca hypoallergenic pet-friendly substance akin to house paint.\u201dAfter speaking with Home Depot, Coates says the supplier provided her veterinarian with a list of ingredients in the spray, one of which is ethylene glycol. Coates put the tree outside and Home Depot came to pick it up. This is the same chemical found in antifreeze and is highly toxic to animals, which are drawn by its sweet taste. Example: \u00a0 [Collected via Facebook, December 2014] URGENT!!! We just received a horrifying call from an adopter whose kitten Licorice died this morning of Ethylene Glycol poisoning after ingesting a Christmas tree needle from a tree purchased at Home Depot. Apparently, ALL Christmas trees from Home Depot are sprayed with this material found in ANTI-FREEZE! This has been verified through Home Depot Corporate and the veterinary office that tried to save the kitten\u2019s life.Please keep this family (with four devastated children) in your thoughts tonight. One little girl thinks it\u2019s her fault, because she picked out the tree. The initial warning about Home Depot Christmas trees was quite vague and relayed a difficult-to-understand chain of events, and the cat\u2019s death occurred on the same day the warning was posted, leaving readers unclear about how much of the claim (if any) had been verified. On 11 December 2014, the CBC published an article about the death of Luna and the warning concerning Home Depot Christmas trees: A Stoney Creek, Ont., family adopted a black kitten named Luna from the cat rescue group called Forever Home.The family brought home a Christmas tree from Home Depot after taking the kitten home. They said the feline ingested pine needles and later died. A veterinarian informed the family the cause of death was poisoning from ethylene glycol, extremely toxic to cats. While the cat\u2019s untimely death is sad, the composition of the tree is only one component of the warning circulating on animal advocacy pages; another is the timeline: according to Luna\u2019s owners, the kitten became ill on 9 December 2014 and died the next day. That same day the warning about Home Depot Christmas trees was posted to social media, leaving little time for the circumstances of the kitten\u2019s death to be fully investigated. If the warning were to be taken at face value, a comprehensive necropsy confirming ethylene glycol toxicity and test of the tree definitively determining the latter as the source of the toxin would had to have occurred inside the space of only a few hours. (Quite possibly the cat ingested something harmful that was present in the household somewhere other than on the branches of the family\u2019s newly purchased Christmas tree.) Home Depot\u2019s official Facebook account posted a reply to the thread on 10 December 2014, and their response addressed another consideration: Whether or not cut Christmas trees are frequently sprayed with artificial snow, many trees are sold from at given Home Depot location, but even though some of those trees go to homes where cats reside, there has not been a reported rash of cat poisonings due to the use of artificial snow on cut Christmas trees: We take all of our customer issues seriously and are actively working with the customer, our merchants and vendors to investigate the situation. Although we\u2019ve only one report of this, we\u2019re moving aggressively to address the matter. On 11 December 2014, additional details emerged which included quotes from the veterinarian who treated the cat and more information from Home Depot about the claim.

While it\u2019s true that the Internet is not a comprehensive database of everything that ever occurred in the history of the world, evidence of such a controversial public remark that widely \u201cseen\u201d by average citizens would surely have surfaced at some point by now if it existed.","premise":"A persistent rumor that has been attached to Hillary Clinton for many years now, holding that sometime in the 1990s she made a disparaging remark about nurses. Although this rumor has been circulating for at least a decade now, concrete information about what she actually said, when she said it, or how the public was made aware of the comment has still not come to light. The rumor generally asserts that at sometime indefinite place and time, Hillary Clinton allegedly referred to nurses as \u201cglorified baby sitters\u201d or \u201c\u201dunder-educated, overpaid maids.\u201d  For example, on 6 February 2008 a user posted a message to the AllNurses forum inquiring about the former: OK, there are a lot of people at work saying that at some time Hillary Clinton said that nurses pay is way too high and that they are just glorified baby sitters. Has any one else heard this. I\u2019ve looked at may sights on her and can\u2019t find it. If she did say that, it needs to be made known. Nurses are a large voting population. I hope for her sake she didn\u2019t say that. Is that part of her medical reform plan? As is often the case with apocryphal broadcast legends, many users responded by asserting that they distinctly remembered Clinton\u2019s making such a remark but could offer nothing documenting the event \u2014 attributing the lack of evidence to Clinton\u2019s statement\u2019s supposedly having been made before Internet usage became widespread: OK people, I have done my searching. (sorry it took so long, back to school) I was told by the people I went to for this information that because it was said, or rumored back in 1993, the level of information of that type was limited in cyberspace, so it will remain a rumor with no substantiated documentation When a similar rumor was mentioned in the same forum in July 2016, this time holding that Clinton had called nurses \u201coverpaid\u201d and \u201cnothing but doctor\u2019s handmaidens,\u201d users again explained away the lack of evidence by asserting that this statement was made before \u201ceverything [was] documented online\u201d:  Some of us are old enough to remember what many in the media choose to forget. (Believe it or not, not everything is documented online). Shortly after Bill Clinton was elected President, Hillary did indeed say that nurses were overpaid and were nothing but doctor\u2019s handmaidens. Although evidence is lacking, there\u2019s no shortage of accusations. In 2007, Clinton was accused of having said that \u201cnurses are overpaid and undereducated,\u201d and in August 2016 the image displayed above, holding that Clinton once called nurses \u201coverpaid maids\u201d was circulated on social media. The fact is, so many people could not legitimately have \u201cseen\u201d or \u201cheard\u201d Clinton make such a remark, as claimed, unless it was covered by the news media at the time \u2014 and yet no one has turned up any news source, print or broadcast, documenting that she ever said any such thing. That the event might have occurred before the days of widespread Internet usage is not sufficient to explain away the lack of proof \u2014 Bill Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201c$200 haircut\u201d occurred at about the same time as his wife\u2019s alleged remark did (1993), yet there is ample contemporaneous documentation of the former to be found both online and in archival sources. So how did this rumor get its start? Hillary Clinton was an advocate for health care reform during her time as First Lady, and in 1993 she chaired\u00a0the Task Force on National Health Care Reform. According to the Hillary Clinton Quarterly, she delivered her first speech on the subject on 18 June 1993 to a panel of governors in Woodstock, Vermont. What follows are a few quotes from this speech which may have been misremembered, misinterpreted, exaggerated, or spun into any of the aforementioned accusations: We can no longer write a blank check for health care in this country. We will have to ask everyone \u2014 workers, employers, doctors, nurses, other health care providers, hospitals \u2014 to do their part. [W]e are proposing a wholesale reduction in the frustrating and wasteful paperwork that eats up the health care system. When you look as Ira [Magaziner] and I have at the volumes of regulations that have been put into effect over the years, the stacks and stacks of forms, you ask yourself where did all this bureaucracy come from? The short answer is that it came from everywhere. It comes from private insurers. It comes from the government. Forms were created to make sure forms were filled out properly. It makes it impossible often for the most vulnerable people to get the care that they need. It also has undercut the delivery of care because as the number of health insurance companies grew \u2014 today there are more than 1,500 \u2014 so did the number of forms. The result is that instead of a system in which patient care and doctor decision-making and nurse caring drive the system, paperwork does. Most nurses now spend nearly half of their time filling out forms. Most physicians now spend an extraordinary percentage of their income contributing to the bookkeeping and accounting necessary to fill out forms. Patients don\u2019t know how to read these bills. They don\u2019t understand these forms. Those of us who\u2019ve gone to school longer than we like to admit can\u2019t understand these forms. And yet we are continuing to be deluged by them because that is the excuse for not getting to the heart of the problem. We now need to make it clear that what is going to count is quality outcomes, not paperwork processing. If we do that, then consumers will see a health care system made understandable and easy \u2014 one insurance form for everybody, a report card for quality that is understandable so that choices can be made, no hidden fine print. Doctors and nurses will finally be able to do what they were trained and educated to do \u2014 keeping people healthy, not filling out forms. Parts of that speech could have been twisted into a political attack accusing Clinton of saying that nurses were \u201coverpaid\u201d and \u201cbabysitters,\u201d even though the context of her speech makes it clear that she was talking about a broken health care system and not accusing nurses of being under-educated or overpaid. The rumored accusations also don\u2019t fit the general attitude that Hillary Clinton has expressed toward nurses, nor nurses towards her. In 2008, Clinton praised nurses as she \u201cwalked a day\u201d in one of their shoes:  The American Nurses Association (ANA) has also endorsed Hillary Clinton, both during both her presidential campaign in 2008 and again in 2016: The American Nurses Association (ANA) today announced its endorsement of Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.

He said he heard the 58,000 figure from a reliable source, and added, \"\"this virus is a lot less dangerous than people think it is.\"\" Since an extended economic downturn can cause some kinds of deaths to rise, and there are more and more warnings about that, it\u2019s worth a moment to unpack what the real research shows. We\u2019ll start with the researcher whose work, indirectly, lies behind Baker\u2019s central argument. More than four decades ago, in a report for the congressional Joint Economic Committee, medical sociologist Harvey Brenner assessed the impact of sustained unemployment. Brenner found that in a five-year period, a 1.4% rise in unemployment added about 30,000 deaths due to suicides (1,540), homicides (1,740), liver disease (870) and cardiovascular\/kidney disease (26,440). Factoring in America\u2019s growing population, a recent opinion piece estimated the added deaths to be 58,000. That piece, citing Brenner, was the source of Baker\u2019s claim. But Brenner, now a professor at the University of North Texas, described how the video fundamentally misused his work. Brenner said his work is about \"\"the permanent loss of jobs,\"\" not an immediate rise in unemployment, no matter how dramatic. The deaths he identified started two years after a sustained economic downturn. \"\"It is not now statistically possible to render a verdict on the economy-based mortality implications of the immediate downturn of the past two months,\"\" Brenner said. \"\"Baker\u2019s video is not factually correct.\"\" Baker builds his entire case on Brenner\u2019s findings. But over the decades, other researchers have cast doubt on Brenner\u2019s core conclusion, some going so far as to say he got things upside down. There are deaths of despair, said Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They wrote a New York Times bestseller \"\"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism.\"\" The deaths primarily were among less educated white Americans and started in the 1990s. \"\"They rose before the Great Recession, they grew during the Great Recession and they grew after the Great Recession,\"\" Case and Deaton wrote in a recent op-ed. \"\"The line of rising deaths shows no perceptible effect of the collapse of the economy.\"\" Case and Deaton point to Spain and Greece as the poster children of the beneficial effects of recession. \"\"Unemployment in Greece and Spain more than tripled, to the point where more than a quarter of the population was unemployed,\"\" they wrote. \"\"Yet Greece and Spain saw increases in life expectancy that were among the best in Europe.\"\" As counterintuitive as it might sound, mortality from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. typically falls during a downturn, as Christopher Ruhm, a University of Virginia economist found. One study reported that in a lackluster economy, people exercise more and smoke less. That\u2019s particularly telling, since heart related deaths were a huge factor in Brenner\u2019s total. Ruhm cautions, though, that the tie between the economy and any given disease is complex and changeable. The reduction in heart disease deaths seen in decades past was not as strong in recent years and might give way further in the current crisis if fear of the virus keeps people from seeking treatment. Still, he called the statistics in Baker\u2019s video \"\"silly.\"\" Ruhm\u2019s overarching warning is that the country is in new territory. \"\"The fundamental fact is that we can\u2019t extrapolate from the recent past to understand the effects of the coronavirus,\"\" he said. \"\"The nature and magnitude of the effects are just too different from past experience.\"\" And as he and other researchers have noted, if the country hadn\u2019t moved to stop the spread of COVID-19, deaths would have mounted astronomically \u2014 which would have brought economic devastation in its own right. A TikTok user said it\u2019s the economic downturn, not the coronavirus, \"\"that\u2019s killing people.\"\" He brought up the statistic that a 1% rise in unemployment causes 58,000 additional deaths over five years, due to heart attacks, drug abuse and other \"\"diseases of despair.\"\" The researcher whose work lies behind that statistic said it doesn\u2019t apply and that he has no question that current deaths, now over 80,000, stem from the virus.

The deaths he identified started two years after a sustained economic downturn. \"\"It is not now statistically possible to render a verdict on the economy-based mortality implications of the immediate downturn of the past two months,\"\" Brenner said. \"\"Baker\u2019s video is not factually correct.\"\" Baker builds his entire case on Brenner\u2019s findings. But over the decades, other researchers have cast doubt on Brenner\u2019s core conclusion, some going so far as to say he got things upside down. There are deaths of despair, said Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They wrote a New York Times bestseller \"\"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism.\"\" The deaths primarily were among less educated white Americans and started in the 1990s. \"\"They rose before the Great Recession, they grew during the Great Recession and they grew after the Great Recession,\"\" Case and Deaton wrote in a recent op-ed. \"\"The line of rising deaths shows no perceptible effect of the collapse of the economy.\"\" Case and Deaton point to Spain and Greece as the poster children of the beneficial effects of recession. \"\"Unemployment in Greece and Spain more than tripled, to the point where more than a quarter of the population was unemployed,\"\" they wrote. \"\"Yet Greece and Spain saw increases in life expectancy that were among the best in Europe.\"\" As counterintuitive as it might sound, mortality from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. typically falls during a downturn, as Christopher Ruhm, a University of Virginia economist found. One study reported that in a lackluster economy, people exercise more and smoke less. That\u2019s particularly telling, since heart related deaths were a huge factor in Brenner\u2019s total. Ruhm cautions, though, that the tie between the economy and any given disease is complex and changeable. The reduction in heart disease deaths seen in decades past was not as strong in recent years and might give way further in the current crisis if fear of the virus keeps people from seeking treatment. Still, he called the statistics in Baker\u2019s video \"\"silly.\"\" Ruhm\u2019s overarching warning is that the country is in new territory. \"\"The fundamental fact is that we can\u2019t extrapolate from the recent past to understand the effects of the coronavirus,\"\" he said. \"\"The nature and magnitude of the effects are just too different from past experience.\"\" And as he and other researchers have noted, if the country hadn\u2019t moved to stop the spread of COVID-19, deaths would have mounted astronomically \u2014 which would have brought economic devastation in its own right. A TikTok user said it\u2019s the economic downturn, not the coronavirus, \"\"that\u2019s killing people.\"\" He brought up the statistic that a 1% rise in unemployment causes 58,000 additional deaths over five years, due to heart attacks, drug abuse and other \"\"diseases of despair.\"\" The researcher whose work lies behind that statistic said it doesn\u2019t apply and that he has no question that current deaths, now over 80,000, stem from the virus. No analyst said the immediate scale of deaths could be tied to rising unemployment.\"\", and claim \"\u201cIt\u2019s not the coronavirus that\u2019s killing people. It is the economy.\u201d\". Please explain why the claim is False.","explanation_llama":"The claim is False because the expert, Steven Baker, misused and misinterpreted the research, and the actual data shows that the deaths of despair are not directly caused by the economy. The research shows that sustained unemployment can lead to increased deaths, but this is not applicable to the current situation, and other factors such as the virus are likely to have a significant impact on mortality rates."}

Also included was a video titled \u201cNASA admits chemtrails,\u201d published to YouTube on 13 July 2013 (and purportedly recorded three days earlier):  The clip\u00a0(which had no video component, only audio) was purported to be\u00a0a recorded phone call between a woman identified only as \u201cSue\u201d and NASA astrophysicist\u00a0Douglas Rowland. \u201cSue\u201d brought up\u00a0a\u00a0video she watched in which lithium was mentioned, and the exchange that followed illustrated how the caller and the NASA scientist were carrying\u00a0on entirely separate conversations. Sue\u00a0fixated on the use of the word \u201clithium\u201d as Rowland tried\u00a0to explain NASA\u2019s study of the upper atmosphere, and why conditions\u00a0there differed from those\u00a0at lower altitudes: Sue: When the article came out in the major newspapers including The Huffington Post there was no mention of lithium, not one. Not one mention of lithium until I heard the recording of the actual \u2026 I \u2026 listened to the rockets go off. I had no idea there was going to be a lithium dispersed until I heard \u2018Payload \u2026 lithium \u2026 dispersed.\u2019\u201d Rowland: Right, there was lithium dispersed and I\u2019d be happy to talk about it. I think you may be under so misconceptions about what we\u2019re doing, but I\u2019m happy to tell you any details that you need. Sue: It says in your article that you\u2019re doing it for communications. Rowland: There are many reasons we\u2019re doing it because we don\u2019t understand how the wind in the upper atmosphere moves. Chemtrails \u2026 there are different kinds of chemtrails. Different trails at night. We use different trails during the day. The wind blows them around. They glow either on their own or from scattered sunlight. We take pictures and we can see how the wind trail moves around. It\u2019s just like if you were taking a picture of an airplane contrail. You could use that to see how the wind was blowing. This is much higher altitude so we use these chemical trails. Sue: What is the purpose of knowing what the wind\u2019s going to do in the ionosphere? Rowland: The purpose is really to understand our planet. It\u2019s very fundamental science. Every day we know there is electrical current that flow over the head that is naturally there. They have been there ever since the Earth had an atmosphere and electrical field. And the wind is driven by the sun. The sun heats the atmosphere, the wind blows and every day that wind drives an electric current and we\u2019re trying to understand what causes that. Simply how does it work in detail, and also importantly when the sun becomes active with lots of sun spots and lots of magnetic activity that changes the wind pattern and changes the electric current. We want to understand both what it is on a regular day when there is no solar activity and then what it is when there is a lot of solar activity. Sue: Is there some other way you can do it without dispersing the lithium? Rowland: We\u2019re researching other ways. The lithium is actually harmless to the environment and we can show you more about that but it is tricky to use because it\u2019s very faint. You can\u2019t see it with your naked eye. You have to have special cameras to see it so we don\u2019t like to use it for that reason. It\u2019s hard measurement to make. We\u2019re researching other ways to put censors directly on the rocket to measure the wind and those are ongoing. We\u2019re trying to develop them now and one of the purposes of this mission was to do that. Between incorrectly framed data about unrelated studies of mass vaccination or West Nile virus spraying and the video,\u00a0AnonHQ concluded that \u201chopefully we\u2019ve established that this IS happening,\u201d when neither the article nor video had established any\u00a0such thing. What actually transpired was folks\u00a0(one of whom harassed a NASA scientist and encouraged others to do the same) misinterpreted\u00a0publicized\u00a0scientific research to\u00a0fit a pre-existing conspiracy theory. In the conversation between Rowland and Sue (during which portions were clearly elided) the only admissions made were those about the detail of upper atmosphere study, already publicly disclosed on a regular basis by NASA and linked in this article. The use of lithium in such research was neither\u00a0a\u00a0secret nor\u00a0cause for concern. NASA published an article\u00a0in January 2013 explaining its purpose, one of many highlighting projects of the nature Rowland discussed: NASA successfully launched a Terrier-Improved Orion suborbital rocket at 5:50 p.m. EST this evening from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. During the flight, two red-colored lithium vapor trails were produced. Reports from those viewing the launch or vapor trails came from as far away as the Outer Banks, N.C.; eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Two different methods for creating the lithium vapor were tested to determine which configuration is best for observing various science phenomena in space. NASA has two missions later this year that will use lithium trails to assist scientists in observing events in space \u2026 In the technology test launch, two canisters in the rocket\u2019s payload section contained solid metal lithium rods or chips embedded in a thermite cake. The thermite was ignited and produced heat to vaporize the lithium. The vapor was released in space to be detected and tracked optically. The lithium combustion process posed no threat to the public during the release in space. When heated, the lithium rods change to lithium vapor and small amounts of lithium oxide. The thermite reaction produces iron and aluminum oxide. NASA similarly reported the same sort of research\u00a0in\u00a0July 2011, in an\u00a0openly-available article\u00a0about the observation of\u00a0lithium trails in the upper atmosphere: The rockets \u2014 known as sounding rockets from the nautical term \u201cto sound,\u201d meaning to measure \u2014 will launch sometime between July 5 and 23 depending on ionospheric and weather conditions. NASA\u2019s sounding rocket program at Wallops dates back to the agency\u2019s inception in 1958. Not only do sounding rockets offer a low cost way to access space, they also provide access to areas of the atmosphere too low for satellites. In this experiment, the scientists will fly two pair of rockets. One in each pair will measure data about the charged or \u201cionized\u201d gas \u2014 called plasma \u2014 as well as the neutral gas, through which it travels. The other will shoot out a long trail of lithium gas to track the wind movement. The instrumented rockets are 40 feet long and 17 inches in diameter, carrying a payload of 600 lbs. The lithium rockets are 14 inches in diameter and are about six feet long. Beginning July 5, the team will set up each day from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT, ready to launch as soon as there\u2019s evidence of currents in the ionosphere as well as a crystal clear skies \u2013 necessary for successful observation of the lithium trail. With all the focus conspiracy sites placed on NASA, none appeared to discover the agency\u2019s explanation of purpose for lithium in rocket launches (published in 1958 and available freely on the agency\u2019s web site): Chemical propellants in common use deliver specific impulse values ranging from about 175 up to about 300 seconds. The most energetic chemical propellants are theoretically capable of specific impulses up to about 400 seconds. High values of specific impulse are obtained from high exhaust-gas temperature, and from exhaust gas having very low (molecular) weight. To be efficient, therefore, a propellant should have a large heat of combustion to yield high temperatures, and should produce combustion products containing simple, light molecules embodying such elements as hydrogen (the lightest), carbon, oxygen, fluorine, and the lighter metals (aluminum, beryllium, lithium) \u2026 Devices such as the nuclear rocket must use some chemical as a working fluid or propellant, although no energy is supplied to the rocket by any chemical reaction \u2026 Propellants that would be suitable for use in electric propulsion devices are the easily ionized metals. The one most generally considered is cesium; next best are rubidium, potassium, sodium, and lithium. On 21 April 2016, we spoke with both Rowland and NASA\u2019s Keith Koehler. Koehler confirmed that the tracer rockets in question operated at far higher altitudes than commercial aircraft (chemtrail conspiracies focus on lower altitudes). Koehler explained why vapor tracers were\u00a0necessary to measure atmospheric conditions: Vapor tracers used in NASA suborbital rocket missions allow scientist to see that which is not visible to the naked eye. They are used to measure atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, typically between 50 and 248 miles altitude (Commercial aircraft fly around six miles altitude.). The vapor is released along a portion of the rocket trajectory. The small amount of vapor is then visible from the ground. By tracking their motions directly with cameras on the ground (or in an airplane), these tracers make it possible to observe the movements of the upper atmosphere or the ionosphere directly. The purpose of the measurements is to understand how the natural upper atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts behave, not to change them. The releases would therefore have little value if they were changing the behavior of the upper atmosphere or ionosphere. The tracers are released in a part of the atmosphere where meteors from space deposit 100 to 200 tons of metallic material every day across the globe compared to a one-pound tracer release, for example. The meteors contain the same types of metallic material used in the tracers.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":2473,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"On 19 April 2016, the web site\u00a0AnonHQ published an article\u00a0that purported to show \u201cproof\u201d NASA admitted to spraying lithium into the atmosphere: There\u2019s the official explanation for why NASA is spraying lithium, a pharmaceutical drug most often used to treat people with manic depression or bi-polar disorder, into our ionosphere, and then there is the probable reason(s).

High values of specific impulse are obtained from high exhaust-gas temperature, and from exhaust gas having very low (molecular) weight. To be efficient, therefore, a propellant should have a large heat of combustion to yield high temperatures, and should produce combustion products containing simple, light molecules embodying such elements as hydrogen (the lightest), carbon, oxygen, fluorine, and the lighter metals (aluminum, beryllium, lithium) \u2026 Devices such as the nuclear rocket must use some chemical as a working fluid or propellant, although no energy is supplied to the rocket by any chemical reaction \u2026 Propellants that would be suitable for use in electric propulsion devices are the easily ionized metals. The one most generally considered is cesium; next best are rubidium, potassium, sodium, and lithium. On 21 April 2016, we spoke with both Rowland and NASA\u2019s Keith Koehler. Koehler confirmed that the tracer rockets in question operated at far higher altitudes than commercial aircraft (chemtrail conspiracies focus on lower altitudes). Koehler explained why vapor tracers were\u00a0necessary to measure atmospheric conditions: Vapor tracers used in NASA suborbital rocket missions allow scientist to see that which is not visible to the naked eye. They are used to measure atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, typically between 50 and 248 miles altitude (Commercial aircraft fly around six miles altitude.). The vapor is released along a portion of the rocket trajectory. The small amount of vapor is then visible from the ground. By tracking their motions directly with cameras on the ground (or in an airplane), these tracers make it possible to observe the movements of the upper atmosphere or the ionosphere directly. The purpose of the measurements is to understand how the natural upper atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts behave, not to change them. The releases would therefore have little value if they were changing the behavior of the upper atmosphere or ionosphere. The tracers are released in a part of the atmosphere where meteors from space deposit 100 to 200 tons of metallic material every day across the globe compared to a one-pound tracer release, for example. The meteors contain the same types of metallic material used in the tracers.\", and claim \"NASA admitted to dosing Americans with airborne lithium.\". Please explain why the claim is False.","explanation_llama":"The claim that NASA admitted to dosing Americans with airborne lithium is FALSE. The article and video presented as evidence are misinterpreted and misleading. NASA's explanation for using lithium in their research is clear: it is used as a vapor trail in upper atmosphere studies to measure wind patterns and ion drifts, not to dose Americans with lithium. The lithium used is harmless to the environment and is not intended for human consumption. NASA has publicly disclosed their research on this topic and has provided explanations for their methods and purposes. The claim is based on misinformation and conspiracy theories."}

Mark Begich, the incumbent Democrat from Alaska, has been forced to pull a television ad that said his Republican opponent\u2019s actions as the state attorney general led to a gruesome murder -- a serious charge based on paper-thin evidence. Begich released an attack ad the Friday before Labor Day that said Dan Sullivan was soft on sex crime during his 18-month tenure as attorney general. Begich and Sullivan are locked in a toss-up race, one of several that could decide which party controls the Senate come November. \"\"(Sullivan) let a lot of sex offenders get off with light sentences,\"\" says the ad\u2019s narrator, identified as a retired police officer, standing outside of an Anchorage apartment complex. \"\"One of them got out of prison and is now charged with breaking into that apartment building, murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter. Dan Sullivan should not be a U.S. senator.\"\" The ad is talking about a crime allegedly committed by a man named Jerry Andrew Active on May 25, 2013 -- just hours after Active was released from prison. Active should have spent several more years behind bars for a prior sexual assault conviction, according to an Alaska Department of Law investigation, but a clerical error led to a shorter sentence. Active is currently awaiting trial on the May 2013 charges. The ad did not mention Active by name, but it gave a detailed description of the crime -- which received significant coverage in the Alaska media last year -- in front of the building where it occurred. The Sullivan campaign retaliated almost immediately with its own ad (in which they identify Active), defending his record and calling Begich\u2019s ad \"\"shameful.\"\" Both campaigns have pulled the videos down at the request of the victims\u2019 family, who claimed the ad was insensitive and could affect upcoming prosecution. (PolitiFact obtained a copy of the ad in order to fact-check it; a TV report in Alaska shows a clip of it.) Even though the ads are no longer on the Alaska airwaves, the skirmish points to serious criminal justice issues. So we decided to dig in and see if Sullivan bears any responsibility for Active\u2019s alleged crime. We found that the timing just doesn\u2019t line up. Doing time Begich\u2019s campaign declined to talk with us about the ad -- citing the pending trial -- so we asked the Alaska Democratic Party for evidence tying Sullivan to events leading to Active\u2019s sentencing and the May 2013 crime. The party pointed out that Sullivan was attorney general in March 2010, when prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement with Active, who at the time was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, among other charges. (Sullivan\u2019s name is stamped on the plea agreement, though it bears the signature of an assistant district attorney.) The Alaska Department of Law later found that Active\u2019s 2010 plea agreement was based on incorrect information and should have come with a longer sentence. If Active had received the longer sentence, he likely would have still been in jail on the day he committed the murders. But Sullivan is not personally responsible for this plea agreement mistake. Let\u2019s take a look at the course of events, according to the Department of Law. Keep in mind that Sullivan was attorney general from June 2009 to December 2010. In January 2009, state troopers arrested Active for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and then physically assaulting the girl\u2019s mother and brother. In March 2010, Active pled guilty to those charges, accepting a deal with prosecutors that sentenced him to about four years of jail time (including the time he had served up to that point, since his arrest in January 2009). Active was released in 2012. From then on, he was in and out of prison on probation violation charges until May 25, 2013, when he committed the murder referenced in Begich\u2019s ad. When drawing up Active\u2019s plea agreement in 2010, the state looked at his criminal history. As is customary, they received this information from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network. However, Active\u2019s report failed to identify a 2007 felony conviction for providing a minor with alcohol. (That\u2019s typically a misdemeanor, but Active\u2019s charge was treated as a felony due to some nuances in the law.) Because of the inaccurate report, the Department of Law miscalculated Active\u2019s presumptive sentence. They believed it to be between two years and 12 years -- leading to his four-year sentence and release in 2012. If their calculation had included his 2007 felony charge, he would have had a presumptive sentence of eight years to 15 years. The Department of Law said at the time that they are not sure how the mistake happened, though the information network sometimes has blind spots when it comes to offenses that happen in rural villages, like the one where Active was arrested in 2007, according to the Alaska Dispatch. Regardless, this chain of events happened before Sullivan became attorney general. The Alaska Public Safety Information Network pulled Active\u2019s report the day after he was arrested in January 2009 -- Sullivan took office the following June. So although Active\u2019s plea agreement and sentencing happened in 2010, while Sullivan was in office, the mistake that led to Active\u2019s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier. (At the time, Sullivan was on active duty for the U.S. Marine Corps, according to his campaign.) Additionally, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Sullivan was personally involved with Active\u2019s case and plea agreement at all, said John Skidmore, director of the Department of Law\u2019s criminal division. The state handles about 40,000 cases each year, at least half of which are felonies -- so it\u2019s \"\"unrealistic\"\" for an\u00a0attorney general to be involved with individual cases, he said. \"\"There is no way that (any attorney general) would be involved in that sort of decision at that level at that time,\"\" Skidmore said. Part of a trend? The Alaska Democrats said that under Sullivan, there was a trend of the state giving sex offenders light sentences -- pointing to a dozen cases in which Alaska prosecutors negotiated sentences with sex offenders that fell at the low end of the sentence-length spectrum. They also noted that Alaska local television station CBS 11 produced a story in March 2010 about what happens to criminals who fail to register as sex offenders with the state. The story includes examples of convicted rapists receiving the minimum sentence for failing to register, and others having charges against them dropped. However, Alaska\u2019s sentencing structure encourages prosecutors to negotiate sentencing agreements, leaving judges with little influence over sentencing, said former Alaska Chief Justice Walter Carpeneti in 2012. And these presumptive sentencing policies had been in place since the late 1970s -- so when Sullivan entered the office, these practices were already well-established. During his time as attorney general and subsequent role as commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan was one of the main faces of the \"\"Choose Respect\"\" campaign, started in 2009 by Republican Gov. Sean Parnell to address domestic violence and sexual assault in Alaska. The \"\"Choose Respect\"\" campaign passed several pieces of legislation while Sullivan was attorney general, which his campaign said exemplifies his commitment to the issue. The laws passed include harsher sentences for people involved with child pornography or human trafficking, revision of bail laws for people charged with serious crimes, and specified procedures for DNA retention in murder and sexual assault cases. The campaign also said Sullivan hired the Department of Law\u2019s first cyber-crimes prosecutor whose focus is combating child pornography. Following Active\u2019s arrest for the May 2013 crimes, the state changed its plea bargaining policies, so Alaska prosecutors are no longer permitted to negotiate lower sentences with people charged with violent felonies or sexual crimes. Our ruling Begich said Sullivan approved a \"\"light sentence\"\" to a sex offender who is now charged with \"\"murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter.\"\" Active, who is awaiting trial, received a shorter sentence than he was supposed to, but the mistake that led to this sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general.

The Sullivan campaign retaliated almost immediately with its own ad (in which they identify Active), defending his record and calling Begich\u2019s ad \"\"shameful.\"\" Both campaigns have pulled the videos down at the request of the victims\u2019 family, who claimed the ad was insensitive and could affect upcoming prosecution. (PolitiFact obtained a copy of the ad in order to fact-check it; a TV report in Alaska shows a clip of it.) Even though the ads are no longer on the Alaska airwaves, the skirmish points to serious criminal justice issues. So we decided to dig in and see if Sullivan bears any responsibility for Active\u2019s alleged crime. We found that the timing just doesn\u2019t line up. Doing time Begich\u2019s campaign declined to talk with us about the ad -- citing the pending trial -- so we asked the Alaska Democratic Party for evidence tying Sullivan to events leading to Active\u2019s sentencing and the May 2013 crime. The party pointed out that Sullivan was attorney general in March 2010, when prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement with Active, who at the time was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, among other charges. (Sullivan\u2019s name is stamped on the plea agreement, though it bears the signature of an assistant district attorney.) The Alaska Department of Law later found that Active\u2019s 2010 plea agreement was based on incorrect information and should have come with a longer sentence. If Active had received the longer sentence, he likely would have still been in jail on the day he committed the murders. But Sullivan is not personally responsible for this plea agreement mistake. Let\u2019s take a look at the course of events, according to the Department of Law. Keep in mind that Sullivan was attorney general from June 2009 to December 2010. In January 2009, state troopers arrested Active for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and then physically assaulting the girl\u2019s mother and brother. In March 2010, Active pled guilty to those charges, accepting a deal with prosecutors that sentenced him to about four years of jail time (including the time he had served up to that point, since his arrest in January 2009). Active was released in 2012. From then on, he was in and out of prison on probation violation charges until May 25, 2013, when he committed the murder referenced in Begich\u2019s ad. When drawing up Active\u2019s plea agreement in 2010, the state looked at his criminal history. As is customary, they received this information from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network. However, Active\u2019s report failed to identify a 2007 felony conviction for providing a minor with alcohol. (That\u2019s typically a misdemeanor, but Active\u2019s charge was treated as a felony due to some nuances in the law.) Because of the inaccurate report, the Department of Law miscalculated Active\u2019s presumptive sentence. They believed it to be between two years and 12 years -- leading to his four-year sentence and release in 2012. If their calculation had included his 2007 felony charge, he would have had a presumptive sentence of eight years to 15 years. The Department of Law said at the time that they are not sure how the mistake happened, though the information network sometimes has blind spots when it comes to offenses that happen in rural villages, like the one where Active was arrested in 2007, according to the Alaska Dispatch. Regardless, this chain of events happened before Sullivan became attorney general. The Alaska Public Safety Information Network pulled Active\u2019s report the day after he was arrested in January 2009 -- Sullivan took office the following June. So although Active\u2019s plea agreement and sentencing happened in 2010, while Sullivan was in office, the mistake that led to Active\u2019s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier. (At the time, Sullivan was on active duty for the U.S. Marine Corps, according to his campaign.) Additionally, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Sullivan was personally involved with Active\u2019s case and plea agreement at all, said John Skidmore, director of the Department of Law\u2019s criminal division. The state handles about 40,000 cases each year, at least half of which are felonies -- so it\u2019s \"\"unrealistic\"\" for an\u00a0attorney general to be involved with individual cases, he said. \"\"There is no way that (any attorney general) would be involved in that sort of decision at that level at that time,\"\" Skidmore said. Part of a trend? The Alaska Democrats said that under Sullivan, there was a trend of the state giving sex offenders light sentences -- pointing to a dozen cases in which Alaska prosecutors negotiated sentences with sex offenders that fell at the low end of the sentence-length spectrum. They also noted that Alaska local television station CBS 11 produced a story in March 2010 about what happens to criminals who fail to register as sex offenders with the state. The story includes examples of convicted rapists receiving the minimum sentence for failing to register, and others having charges against them dropped. However, Alaska\u2019s sentencing structure encourages prosecutors to negotiate sentencing agreements, leaving judges with little influence over sentencing, said former Alaska Chief Justice Walter Carpeneti in 2012. And these presumptive sentencing policies had been in place since the late 1970s -- so when Sullivan entered the office, these practices were already well-established. During his time as attorney general and subsequent role as commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan was one of the main faces of the \"\"Choose Respect\"\" campaign, started in 2009 by Republican Gov. Sean Parnell to address domestic violence and sexual assault in Alaska. The \"\"Choose Respect\"\" campaign passed several pieces of legislation while Sullivan was attorney general, which his campaign said exemplifies his commitment to the issue. The laws passed include harsher sentences for people involved with child pornography or human trafficking, revision of bail laws for people charged with serious crimes, and specified procedures for DNA retention in murder and sexual assault cases. The campaign also said Sullivan hired the Department of Law\u2019s first cyber-crimes prosecutor whose focus is combating child pornography. Following Active\u2019s arrest for the May 2013 crimes, the state changed its plea bargaining policies, so Alaska prosecutors are no longer permitted to negotiate lower sentences with people charged with violent felonies or sexual crimes. Our ruling Begich said Sullivan approved a \"\"light sentence\"\" to a sex offender who is now charged with \"\"murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter.\"\" Active, who is awaiting trial, received a shorter sentence than he was supposed to, but the mistake that led to this sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general. So to pin the error on Sullivan is wrong, and to suggest that he actively approved the sentence is a fabrication. The ad is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation.\"\", and claim \"\"Mark Begich Says Dan Sullivan approved a \"\"light sentence\"\" for a sex offender\u00a0who got out of prison and\u00a0is now charged with a gruesome murder and sexual assault.\"\". Please explain why the claim is False.","explanation_llama":"The claim is False because the evidence shows that the clerical error leading to the shorter sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general, and Sullivan was not personally responsible for the plea agreement or the sentence."}

Do most women seeking an abortion change their mind after seeing their ultrasound scan? Previous fact check We\u2019ve previously reviewed a claim similar to Walker\u2019s. A couple of weeks before Walker signed the ultrasound requirement law in July 2013, conservative pundit Rachel Campos-Duffy, the wife of U.S. Rep.

One anti-abortion organization claimed a figure of nearly 90 percent for its ultrasound program among a certain group of women. But there was no solid evidence to back Campos-Duffy\u2019s claim, which was more sweeping than Walker\u2019s. Evidence backing Walker Walker\u2019s campaign cited two pieces of evidence that have surfaced since our Campos-Duffy fact check. 1. Anti-abortion group The first is a short news release issued in March 2015 by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which describes itself as a \"\"national legal network of prolife pregnancy centers.\"\" The release described a survey that the group said it did of some of its centers. According to the release, 410 of the group\u2019s 1,050 centers that offer ultrasounds responded to the survey. And in 75,318 cases in 2013 in which ultrasounds were given -- to what the group labeled as \"\"abortion-minded\"\" or \"\"abortion-vulnerable\"\" women -- 78 percent of the women decided against having an abortion. The release did not say whether there was follow-up to see if the women gave birth, which is what Walker claims. And like much of the evidence we reviewed in the Campos-Duffy fact check this evidence is self-reported by a group that actively advocates against abortion. 2. Academic study Walker\u2019s campaign also cited an academic study published in January 2014 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. The researchers reviewed medical records for 15,575 visits by women seeking abortion care at Planned Parenthood clinics in Los Angeles in 2011. Among women who viewed their ultrasound images, over 98.4 percent of the pregnancies were terminated. But Walker\u2019s campaign highlighted a narrower finding of the study. Some 93 percent of the women had entered the clinic expressing what the researchers characterized as a high degree of certainty that they wanted an abortion. Among the 7 percent who expressed medium or low certainty about their decision, viewing the ultrasound \"\"was significantly associated with deciding to continue the pregnancy.\"\" But, clearly, that involves a small percentage of the women in the study. Two experts We spoke with one of the authors of the study, University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine professor Katrina Kimport; and with Michele Chadwick, executive director of the anti-abortion ICU Mobile, which is based in Akron, Ohio.

And often that decision to continue is not made simply as a result of viewing the ultrasound, but because counseling and other services are provided in addition to the scan.

This claim proved both incorrect and ridiculous.","premise":"\"Democrats are \"\"fighting a war on religious liberty,\"\" U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz told the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 16, 2013. In his keynote speech at the event (commonly known as CPAC) held annually by the American Conservative Union, the Texas Republican equated current events to Democrats telling the Catholic Church, \"\"Change your religious beliefs or we'll use our power in the federal government to shut down your charities and your hospitals.\"\" Reading that as a reference to the administration of President Barack Obama, we asked Cruz\u2019s office for backup information. Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton, saying Cruz also was referring to congressional Democrats who voted for the health care overhaul known as Obamacare, emailed us links and articles from conservative and religious sources criticizing government decisions on how churches and affiliated organizations are to comply with the law\u2019s mandate that insurance plans cover preventive care -- including an administration interpretation that this includes birth control without employees paying any out-of-pocket costs. None of the articles Rushton sent, though, showed Democrats or the government saying they would shut down churches\u2019 hospitals or charities for failing to comply. A Feb. 10, 2012, PolitiFact story gave the backdrop: 2010\u2019s health care overhaul required most health plans to cover recommended \"\"preventive health services\"\" without co-pays or deductibles. But the law left to the administration to decide which women\u2019s health services to include. In August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services ruled that insurance plans would have to cover sterilization and all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration, from condoms to hormone shots to \"\"morning-after\"\" pills, starting in August 2012 at the earliest. But according to Catholic precepts, contraception is against moral law. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says that if contraceptives must be offered without a co-pay, that means the cost is spread among employers and all insured employees -- meaning that Catholics would end up paying for birth control. Those rules were finalized in 2012, and more changes have been proposed as of 2013, amid much public debate. In the 2012 rules, which are still in force, the government exempted some religious employers and gave them a year\u2019s grace period before the requirements took effect. To qualify for the \"\"religious employer\"\" exemption, a group had to be a nonprofit that served and employed people who shared its religious tenets and had as its purpose inculcating religious values. But the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the governing body of the Catholic Church in this country, said that definition was too narrow because it ruled out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups, such as those that serve non-Catholics. Changes that the government proposed Feb. 1, 2013, would widen the definition of \"\"religious employer\"\" and, according to a Reuters news story posted that day, require that arrangements be made for people who work for self-insured religious organizations to get contraception coverage through private insurers. Rushton said the proposal did not go far enough and sent us material from the conservative Heritage Foundation including a Feb. 9, 2013, article saying that the \"\"so-called fix would only apply to certain religious nonprofit organizations, leaving many others \u2014 such as business owners, individuals, and non-religious nonprofits \u2014 without any recourse from the mandate.\"\" Bishops\u2019 spokeswoman Sister Mary Ann Walsh told us by email that \"\"massive fines for non-compliance\"\" would force some groups to close, and the proposed changes would not fix the situation. \"\"If they fail to provide coverage for contraception or sterilization in their health plans,\"\" Walsh wrote, \"\"they\u2019re subject to an assessment of $100 a day per employee. ... And if they drop their health plans to avoid the mandate, they\u2019re subject to an annual penalty of $2,000 per employee,\"\" she wrote, citing the sections of U.S. law that spell out the fines: 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980D(b) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(a), (c)(1). \"\"For a lot of nonprofit entities, such fines could run in the millions of dollars and would render their operations unsustainable,\"\" Walsh said. She did not give instances of the government threatening to directly close an institution. We searched for such communication to the church and came up empty. New York\u2019s archbishop, Timothy Dolan, said in a Feb. 9, 2012, \"\"CBS This Morning\"\" interview that Obama had backed down from promises made during a November 2011 meeting at the White House. For his part, Obama said his administration sought to protect religious freedom with its rules for carrying out the mandate. The president said in a Feb. 10, 2012, press conference: I spoke directly to various Catholic officials, and I promised that before finalizing the rule as it applied to them, we would spend the next year working with institutions like Catholic hospitals and Catholic universities to find an equitable solution that protects religious liberty and ensures that every woman has access to the care that she needs. \u2026 The result will be that religious organizations won\u2019t have to pay for these services, and no religious institution will have to provide these services directly. Dolan wrote in a March 2, 2012, letter to fellow bishops that \"\"the (p)resident announced that the insurance providers would have to pay the bill, instead of the (c)hurch\u2019s schools, hospitals, clinics, or vast network of charitable outreach having to do so.... since a big part of our ministries are \u2018self-insured,\u2019 we still ask how this protects us.\"\" White House staff, Dolan wrote, told bishops\u2019 conference staffers that reconsidering the mandate and widening the exemption were off the table. Cruz\u2019s spokesman, Rushton, said companies facing similar contraception-providing requirements have sued and gotten injunctions delaying their fines. But once those delays and the religious groups\u2019 grace period expire, he said, \"\"unless they win in court or the mandate is changed, these institutions will be fined out of existence.\"\" When we inquired, White House spokesman Eric Schultz didn\u2019t speak directly to Cruz\u2019s claim that government shutdowns had been threatened, but he emailed materials including a Catholic Health Association release issued Feb. 13, 2013, that said the group of nonprofit health systems was pleased with the new definition of \"\"religious employer\"\" and called the changes \"\"substantial progress.\"\" Schultz also sent a Feb. 1, 2013, press release from the nonprofit advocacy group Catholics United that said the changes were a victory for the Catholic church. Alternately, Rushton said, \"\"The idea is, such organizations may choose to cease certain activities rather than violate their conscience.\"\" He sent us a Feb. 28, 2012, news story from the conservative Cybercast News Service that quoted the Chicago archbishop, Cardinal Francis George, predicting his area\u2019s Catholic hospitals and health care institutions would close within two years.

Cruz\u2019s spokesman, Rushton, said companies facing similar contraception-providing requirements have sued and gotten injunctions delaying their fines. But once those delays and the religious groups\u2019 grace period expire, he said, \"\"unless they win in court or the mandate is changed, these institutions will be fined out of existence.\"\" When we inquired, White House spokesman Eric Schultz didn\u2019t speak directly to Cruz\u2019s claim that government shutdowns had been threatened, but he emailed materials including a Catholic Health Association release issued Feb. 13, 2013, that said the group of nonprofit health systems was pleased with the new definition of \"\"religious employer\"\" and called the changes \"\"substantial progress.\"\" Schultz also sent a Feb. 1, 2013, press release from the nonprofit advocacy group Catholics United that said the changes were a victory for the Catholic church. Alternately, Rushton said, \"\"The idea is, such organizations may choose to cease certain activities rather than violate their conscience.\"\" He sent us a Feb. 28, 2012, news story from the conservative Cybercast News Service that quoted the Chicago archbishop, Cardinal Francis George, predicting his area\u2019s Catholic hospitals and health care institutions would close within two years. At that time, George said, he saw four choices: turn secular, pay \"\"exorbitant\"\" fines that are \"\"not economically sustainable,\"\" sell out to a non-Catholic operator or shut down. Our ruling Cruz, alluding to Obamacare\u2019s contraception insurance coverage mandate, said Democrats told the Catholic Church they would use federal powers to shut down its charities and hospitals if the church doesn\u2019t change its beliefs. We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close. The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down. Perhaps. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government. To the contrary, the administration has moved to widen the mandate\u2019s exemption for religious employers and provide a workaround for those who act as their own insurance providers -- with the goal of allowing affected parties to continue their work without violating or changing their beliefs. This claim proved both incorrect and ridiculous. !\"\", and claim \"Ted Cruz Says the Democrats told the Catholic Church that they\u2019ll use federal powers to shut down church charities and hospitals if the church doesn\u2019t change its beliefs.\". Please explain why the claim is False.","explanation_llama":"The claim is False because there is no evidence to support the statement that Democrats told the Catholic Church they would use federal powers to shut down its charities and hospitals if the church doesn't change its beliefs.

{"claim_id":"29485","hypothesis":"The red-bellied pacu, an invasive species related to the piranha but with human-like teeth, is known to have bitten off men's testicles, killing at least two victims.","explanation_1":"What's true: The pacu is a cousin of the piranha; its teeth look somewhat human-like; in 2001, one male swimmer was reportedly bitten on the genitals and one female swimmer on the leg by pacu fish in in Papua New Guinea, but both survived. What's false: There are no documented instances of Pacu fish biting men's testicles off or of anyone's dying from a pacu bite.","premise":"It\u2019s probably safe to say that most people had never heard of the red-bellied pacu before press reports came out in 2013 warning Scandinavian men not to swim nude in the strait of Oresund (a body of water between Denmark and Sweden) at the risk of losing their testicles to a \u201cfish with human teeth.\u201d The lurid warnings weren\u2019t just published in northern Europe, but all over the world. \u201cIf you\u2019re going swimming in Scandinavia,\u201d began a Huffington Post\u00a0article dated 11 August 2013, for example, \u201cwear your trunks \u2014 no ifs, ands or nuts\u201d: Authorities are warning skinny dippers about the Pacu, a fish similar to the piranha that really enjoys cracking nuts with its strong jaws. They\u2019ve also been known to mistake testicles for something nice and crunchy, and they\u2019re strong enough to take off a finger. Fisherman discovered the horrifying little creature, which is native to South America, in the Danish\/Swedish strait of Oresund, CNN reports. The Pacu can grow to 55 pounds, has giant teeth and looks angry, but is usually the more friendly cousin of the piranha. That is, until it sees a testicle. It was the sort of fluff readers might have just chuckled at and ignored, except that in most cases it bore the imprimatur of experts \u2014 biologist Henrik Carl of the Natural History Museum of Denmark, for one, who was quoted on the Swedish news site The Local: \u201cThe pacu is not normally dangerous to people but it has quite a serious bite, there have been incidents in other countries, such as Papua New Guinea where some men have had their testicles bitten off,\u201d said Henrik Carl, fish expert at the Danish museum. While Carl said the museum\u2019s warning about the pacu, sometimes known as the \u201cball cutter\u201d, was meant \u201cas a bit of fun\u201d, human victims of the pacu are rarely laughing. \u201cThey bite because they\u2019re hungry, and testicles sit nicely in their mouth,\u201d he explained. Well, that scared some people \u2014 so much so that museum associate professor Peter Rask M\u00f8ller, who had written the tongue-in-cheek press release that started it all in the first place, issued a second statement saying it was all just kinda-sorta a joke: We did say that we recommend men to keep their swimsuits tied up until we know if there are more pacus out there in our waters. Of course, this is half a joke since it is very unlikely that you would actually meet one here and that it would bite you. It\u2019s up to people themselves how careful they want to be. I\u2019ll keep my shorts on, though. It only got more confusing from there. Were the fish really dangerous, or not? Had they attacked people, or not? A zoologist consulted by CNN said definitely not: William Fink, a piranha researcher at the University of Michigan who is also curator of fishes at the school\u2019s Museum of Zoology, poured water on the pacu warning. For one thing, he said, pacus are vegetarian \u2014 and there\u2019s no record of them attacking a human. \u201cThey\u2019re fruit eaters. Those big crushing teeth they have is for crushing seeds,\u201d he said. Pacus tend to swim under fruiting trees during high water, waiting for the trees to drop their fruit, seeds and nuts, Fink said. The fish then swim to the surface to eat the tasty morsels. In fact, Fink said, that\u2019s how fishermen catch them: by putting a piece of fruit on the end of a line and letting it float in the water. Pacus swim up to grab it and then get caught. \u201cThe nuts that they\u2019re eating, the fruits that they\u2019re eating, are splashing down from above, and humans don\u2019t act like that when they\u2019re swimming,\u201d Fink said. And unlike piranhas, which have rigid, razor-sharp interlocking teeth, pacus have teeth that resemble human molars and fit together in a similar bite, Fink said. The pacus use those teeth to crush their food, not to rip it apart \u2014 or off. Which would seem cut-and-dried enough to quell all controversy, and in some quarters it did. The CNN article quoting Fink is still cited as evidence in a Wikipedia entry stating that the pacu testicle biting claims were \u201cincorrect\u201d and \u201cbased on a joke that was not meant to be taken seriously.\u201d But, in fact, they weren\u2019t based on a joke. Rumors about pacu biting men\u2019s testicles had already been circulating for years when Peter Rask M\u00f8ller incorporated them into his 2013 press release. They had cropped up most recently during the 2011 season of the Discovery Channel TV show River Monsters, hosted by daredevil fisherman Jeremy Wade:  \u201cI had heard of a couple of fishermen in Papua New Guinea who had been castrated by something in the water,\u201d Wade told the Daily Mail in December 2011. \u201cThe bleeding was so severe that they died. The locals told me that this thing was like a human in the water, biting at the testicles of fishermen. They didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d Wade was eventually able to track down one of the alleged victims of these alleged attacks, but in the beginning, he had difficulty finding people who had first-hand knowledge of a pacu attack. Even for the locals, including those living on the Sepik river where the mutilations were said to have occurred, it was just a story they had heard and repeated ad infinitum. At that point, the story was a decade old. The earliest piece of evidence we find hinting at possible pacu attacks in Papua New Guinea was a 19 June 2001 query on FishBase, an online forum used by ichthyologists to exchange information:  The query cites speculation that a fish reported to have bitten and injured people in the Sepik River might be a flesh-eating piranha: At the PNG National Fisheries Authority we received specimens of a freshwater fish brought from the Sepik River (one of the two largest rivers in PNG) reportedly to have been biting and injuring people in the region. There is speculation among people that the flesh-eating Piranha of S. America must be here in PNG, but how (if it\u2019s true?). It is a concern right now and we are working to identify the fish species and gather more information about the possible ecological impacts the fish (possibly introduced) is causing to the Sepik River. A month later, however, the National Fisheries Authority employee posted again, stating that the species had been identified as Piaractus brachypomus \u2014 the red-bellied pacu. But note what else he said about the Sepik River biting incidents: Our scientific team just came back from the Sepik and Ramu rivers. It was difficult to bring specimens of the fish to Port Moresby so I am not able to send any to the museums we suggested earlier. Augustine Mobiha (the fisheries scientist involved) had collected enough morphometric data which helped us identify the fish as Pacu ( Piaractus brachypomus) and not Piranha. We also found out that the reports of people been [sic] bitten and 3 people killed by the fish were not true. So, within a month after fatal fish biting incidents were reported on the Sepik River, officials of the Papua New Guinea National Fisheries Authority investigated the reports and determined that, while there were pacu in the river, they hadn\u2019t attacked and killed anybody. Which might have been the end of the story had not the press gotten ahold of it. Approximately two weeks before fisheries officials came back with the results of their investigation, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) got wind of the pacu attack story and ran with it: Two Papua New Guinea fishermen have bled to death after having their penises bitten off by piranha-like river fish. The fish, which zero in on urine streams in the water, have struck terror among villagers along the Sepik River, in north-western PNG. Authorities believe the killer fish is an introduced member of the South American pacu family and a relative of the piranha. In both of last month\u2019s fatalities, the fish demonstrated a trait of the piranha by following a trail of urine in the water, swimming to its source and then biting it off with razor-sharp teeth. Since when did following a trail of urine become a \u201cdemonstrated trait of the piranha\u201d? We don\u2019t know. In the past, such a trait has been attributed to a tiny parasitic fish called the candiru, but even then not without controversy. While acknowledging that the specific claim here is that one or more pacu fish killed two men in Papua New Guinea by biting off their penises, not testicles, we\u2019re fairly certain that this story \u2014 which is itself clearly based on little more than contemporaneous rumors \u2014 was the wellspring of all later mentions of genital-biting pacu fish in the media. Albeit largely (though not entirely) ignored by those same media, the National Fisheries Authority went public with the results of its pacu investigation in their July 2001 newsletter: With regards to local newspaper reports that people are being killed by the Pacu Fish, the investigation has revealed the following; 1. Within the area between Korogu village and along the Sepik River to Wagu village (up river from Ambunti Government Station) only one person was attacked on his private part. This person required medical treatment and came from Korogu village. A lady also claimed to have been bitten by the Pacu on her legs, just above her knees. She had some scars present. 2. No deaths from the introduced Pacu Fish attacks were reported from Korogu to Wagu villages. A passage from the actual report written by National Fisheries Authority investigator Augustine Mobiha offers somewhat more detail: There were reported to be two people killed in the Sepik River area by the local media. My investigations through talking with local people in the villagers within the Wagu village to Ambunti station to Korogu villages have indicated that no people were killed. The investigations revealed that four people in Korogu village were reportedly attacked by fish. One of the four individuals was bitten in the private parts area of his body and required professional medical attention. Two of the four individuals were in the river doing their toilet and were frightened by a fish but were not bitten. One lady claims she was bitten by the Pacu fish and has scars on her knee which she claims was from the bites. All the fisheries officers from Angorom to Ambunti along the Sepik River report no deaths due to attacks by the Pacu fish. No individuals from areas between Angorom and Korogu were interviewed but it is anticipated that any deaths due to attack by the Pacu fish would be news and would be known by all officers working in the area.

Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961 \u2014 mother from India arrived in 1960. Neither parent was a legal resident for 5 years prior to Harris\u2019s birth, a requirement for naturalization. Kamala was raised in Canada \u2026 Just like the worst President in American History, Barack Hussein Obama, Kamala Harris was NOT raised in the United States. Is it too much to ask to have a President that was born and RAISED in America? The constitutional requirements for the office of U.S. president are few. As stated in Article II Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, they encompass only citizenship, residency, and age: No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States. The term \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d is not defined in the constitution, but \u201cnatural born\u201d was a term commonly used in the English colonies during the time the Founding Fathers were crafting the Constitution. Like the U.S. constitution itself, the term has roots in English common law, and in cases when constitutional terms are undefined, English common law is generally cited to clarify them \u2014 as explained in a 2011 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report: At the time of independence, and at the time of the framing of the Constitution, the term \u201cnatural born\u201d with respect to citizenship was in use for many years in the American colonies, and then in the states, from British common law and legal usage. Under the common law principle of jus soli (law of the soil), persons born on English soil, even of two alien parents, were \u201cnatural born\u201d subjects and, as noted by the Supreme Court, this \u201csame rule\u201d was applicable in the American colonies and \u201cin the United States afterwards, and continued to prevail under the Constitution \u2026\u201d with respect to citizens. In textual constitutional analysis, it is understood that terms used but not defined in the document must, as explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cbe read in light of British common law\u201d since the Constitution is \u201cframed in the language of the English common law.\u201d The requirements for President are therefore simple and have nothing to do with the naturalization status of one\u2019s parents: Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, on 20 October 1964, making her at least 35 years old and unambiguously a natural-born United States citizen. Any child born on U.S. soil is a citizen of the United States from birth, regardless of the naturalization status of the child\u2019s parents, and regardless of Jacob Wohl\u2019s perplexing assertion to the contrary. Though Harris spent her high school years in Canada, she has been resident in the United States since her time as an undergraduate at Howard University that began in 1982, and she has served in public office in the U.S. continuously since the 1990s. Jacob Wohl is no stranger to invective targeting foreigners, and he seemingly attempted to portray Harris\u2019 high school years in Canada as some sort of nefarious evidence of (perhaps ironically) foreign influence in American politics. \u201cIs it too much to ask to have a President that was born and RAISED in America?\u201d Wohl implored his audience.

Her father arrived from Jamaica in 1961 \u2014 mother from India arrived in 1960. Neither parent was a legal resident for 5 years prior to Harris\u2019s birth, a requirement for naturalization. Kamala was raised in Canada \u2026 Just like the worst President in American History, Barack Hussein Obama, Kamala Harris was NOT raised in the United States. Is it too much to ask to have a President that was born and RAISED in America? The constitutional requirements for the office of U.S. president are few. As stated in Article II Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, they encompass only citizenship, residency, and age: No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen Years a resident within the United States. The term \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d is not defined in the constitution, but \u201cnatural born\u201d was a term commonly used in the English colonies during the time the Founding Fathers were crafting the Constitution. Like the U.S. constitution itself, the term has roots in English common law, and in cases when constitutional terms are undefined, English common law is generally cited to clarify them \u2014 as explained in a 2011 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report: At the time of independence, and at the time of the framing of the Constitution, the term \u201cnatural born\u201d with respect to citizenship was in use for many years in the American colonies, and then in the states, from British common law and legal usage. Under the common law principle of jus soli (law of the soil), persons born on English soil, even of two alien parents, were \u201cnatural born\u201d subjects and, as noted by the Supreme Court, this \u201csame rule\u201d was applicable in the American colonies and \u201cin the United States afterwards, and continued to prevail under the Constitution \u2026\u201d with respect to citizens. In textual constitutional analysis, it is understood that terms used but not defined in the document must, as explained by the Supreme Court, \u201cbe read in light of British common law\u201d since the Constitution is \u201cframed in the language of the English common law.\u201d The requirements for President are therefore simple and have nothing to do with the naturalization status of one\u2019s parents: Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, on 20 October 1964, making her at least 35 years old and unambiguously a natural-born United States citizen. Any child born on U.S. soil is a citizen of the United States from birth, regardless of the naturalization status of the child\u2019s parents, and regardless of Jacob Wohl\u2019s perplexing assertion to the contrary. Though Harris spent her high school years in Canada, she has been resident in the United States since her time as an undergraduate at Howard University that began in 1982, and she has served in public office in the U.S. continuously since the 1990s. Jacob Wohl is no stranger to invective targeting foreigners, and he seemingly attempted to portray Harris\u2019 high school years in Canada as some sort of nefarious evidence of (perhaps ironically) foreign influence in American politics. \u201cIs it too much to ask to have a President that was born and RAISED in America?\u201d Wohl implored his audience. Kamala Harris, the daughter of a Stanford professor father and breast cancer researcher mother, describes herself as having been raised \u201cin Berkeley and in Oakland and in Montreal.\u201d Her parents divorced when she was seven years old, after which she lived with her mother, Shayamala Harris, whose work took her to positions with the Jewish General Hospital and the McGill University Department of Medicine, both of which are located in Montreal, in the Canadian province of Quebec.\", and claim \"Senator Kamala Harris is not eligible to serve as U.S. President because neither of her parents was \u201ca legal resident for 5 years prior to [her] birth\u201d and she was \u201cnot raised in the United States.\u201d\". Please explain why the claim is False.","explanation_llama":"The claim is False because Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, making her a natural-born United States citizen. The Constitution's requirement for President is citizenship, residency, and age, which Harris meets. The fact that her parents were not legal residents for 5 years prior to her birth is irrelevant, as jus soli (law of the soil) principle makes her a citizen by birth."}

They believed he was real. In early 2014, Geyser and Weier decided to become what they called \u201cproxies\u201d of Slender Man, thereby proving their dedication to him and his existence to skeptics. To do so, they\u2019d have to kill someone. Although months in the planning, their mission did not succeed. The victim, Payton Leutner, recovered, though she still lives in fear for her life, her mother says. The accused were tried as adults and pleaded guilty to the attack but argued in court they weren\u2019t responsible for their actions due to mental illness. In December 2017, Weier was sentenced to 25 years in a psychiatric institution. Geyser has yet to face sentencing. The incident was cast\u00a0as a cautionary tale for parents by Waukesha police chief\u00a0Rus\u00adsell Jack, who\u00a0cited\u00a0it as a consequence of allowing children unsupervised access to the Internet: Keeping children safe is more challenging than in years past.

But although it\u2019s true\u00a0there are \u201cdark and wicked things\u201d to be found on the Internet (as in life, generally), and children\u2019s use of the Internet ought indeed to be supervised, to suggest\u00a0that the Slenderman\u00a0materials viewed\u00a0by the accused are \u201cwicked,\u201d in any deeper sense than, say, a Stephen King novel is \u201cwicked,\u201d is to\u00a0misunderstand them. The Slenderman \u201cmythos,\u201d as the accumulated stories, images, and commentary related to the character have come to be called, is a blend of fiction and folklore. It\u2019s a crowd-sourced horror story that hearkens back to\u00a0boogeyman\u00a0tales of old. The first time the name \u201cSlender Man\u201d appeared anywhere in print or on screen was on the entertainment web site\u00a0SomethingAwful.com\u00a0on 10 June 2009. Someone started a thread in a discussion forum, essentially a Photoshop contest, entitled \u201cCreate Paranormal Images.\u201d Among the early entries was one\u00a0posted under\u00a0the pseudonym \u201cVictor Surge\u201d (later identified as member Eric Knudsen), consisting of\u00a0an old photograph manipulated to depict a tall, faceless human-like\u00a0figure with tentacle-like arms lurking in the shadows near a children\u2019s playground:  One of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library blaze. Notable for being taken the day which fourteen children vanished and for what is referred to as \u201cThe Slender Man\u201d. Deformities cited as film defects by officials. Fire at library occurred one week later. Actual photograph confiscated as evidence. 1986, photographer: Mary Thomas, missing since June 13th, 1986. The effect was understated, yet creepy. Inspired by the\u00a0example, others contributed photos and backstory expanding\u00a0on Surge\u2019s\u00a0themes, and piecemeal construction of the Slenderman mythos, a collaborative project\u00a0from the start, was underway. As Surge himself suggested, it was also, from the start, a patchwork of cultural\u00a0influences: Where did you get the source for Slender Man? Or was he done from a scratch? The Slender Man as an idea was made-up off the top of my head, although the concept is based on a number of things that scare me. The name I thought up on the fly when I wrote that first bit. The asset I used for a couple of the pictures was the creepy tall guy from Phantasm, which sadly I have not seen, and the others various guys in suits. All of the things that aren\u2019t the torso and legs, like the tentacles and Slender Man\u2019s face, were painted from scratch however. By the time middle-schoolers Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier encountered\u00a0the Slenderman character\u00a0years later, the mythos had grown considerably and\u00a0was being archived\u00a0on fan sites like\u00a0Creepypasta Wiki\u00a0(creepypasta\u201d being an Internet slang term for user-created horror stories and images). It\u2019s where, for example, the girls would have read\u00a0that Slenderman uses fear to control people\u2019s minds, and then kills them: He is described as wearing a black suit strikingly similar to the visage of the notorious Men In Black, and as the name suggests, appears very thin and able to stretch his limbs and torso to inhuman lengths in order to induce fear and ensnare his prey. Once his arms are outstretched, his victims are put into something of a hypnotized state, where they are utterly helpless to stop themselves from walking into them. He is also able to create tendrils from his fingers and back that he uses to walk on in a similar fashion to Doctor Octopus. The superhuman stretching ability could also be seen as a similarity between himself and Mr. Fantastic. Whether he absorbs, kills, or merely takes his victims to an undisclosed location or dimension is also unknown as there are never any bodies or evidence left behind in his wake to deduce a definite conclusion. It\u2019s also\u00a0where they would have learned what a Slenderman \u201cproxy\u201d is: Proxy (plural: Proxies) is the term given to those who serve The Slender Man. The theory behind the name is that Proxies are entities or people who are under the influence or control of the Slender Man (or the same force that influences Slender Man), and act based on its wants and needs \u2014\u00a0hence, Proxies serve as an in-between (i.e. a proxy) for Slender Man. And it\u2019s where they\u00a0would have been introduced to \u201cevidence\u201d that Slenderman sightings date back to the\u00a016th-century in Germany, where woodcuts documenting reports of a murderous so-called \u201cTall Man\u201d (Der Gro\u00dfmann) with a spear-like arm and superfluous legs were allegedly found:  According to legend, he was a fairy who lived in the Black Forest. Bad children who crept into the woods at night would be relentlessly chased by Der Gro\u00dfmann, who wouldn\u2019t leave them be until he either caught them or they were forced to tell their parents of their wrongdoing. Like other items\u00a0purporting to constitute visual proof\u00a0of Slenderman\u2019s existence, however, the woodcut is merely a\u00a0doctored version of a Hans Holbein print\u00a0(circa 1497, below right) depicting a knight in armor \u201cpierced by Death\u2019s lance\u201d:  It\u2019s hard not to admire the creativity that went into Slenderman. It\u2019s equally hard \u2014 at least, from our point of view\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to subscribe to the view that it was done for a\u00a0malevolent purpose or represents a \u201cdark and wicked\u201d side of the Internet. It\u2019s more accurate to characterize it\u00a0as an ad hoc\u00a0communal art project, or, if you\u2019re a folklorist and your bailiwick includes studying\u00a0the spontaneous generation of stories, an updated, Internet-savvy instance\u00a0of the age-old process of legend creation. American folklorist Andrea Kitta expressed just this view in a January 2017 interview with the web site inews.co.uk: The internet is certainly helping to spread modern urban myths wider and faster than before. Kitta argues, however, that they are more or less exactly like traditional folklore. \u201cThe only difference in some cases is that people may include a picture with the story, which adds to its believability. \u201cBut all of these forms of folklore share many similarities. They tend to be set in the local or historic past, they are believable, and they contain variation.\u201d Folklorists see such tales\u00a0as imbued with deeper social meanings. Shira Chess, author of Folklore, Horror Stories and the Slender Man (2014), explored these in comments to\u00a0The Washington Post: \u201cWe tell ourselves stories because we (humans) are storytelling animals,\u201d she wrote in an e-mail. \u201cAnd, to that end, horror stories take on a specific significance and importance because they function metaphorically \u2014 the horror stories that are the best are often metaphors for other issues that affect our lives on both cultural and personal levels.\u201d Slender Man, Chess says, is a metaphor for \u201chelplessness, power differentials, and anonymous forces.\u201d He\u2019s an infinitely morphable stand-in for things we can neither understand nor control, universal fears that can drive people to great lengths \u2014 even, it would appear, very scary, cold-blooded lengths. Chess seems to be saying it\u2019s the feeling of helplessness and fear underlying them, not horror stories themselves, that can drive people to \u201ccold-blooded lengths.\u201d Andrea Kitta isn\u2019t so sure: Kitta believes that urban legends are sometimes wrongly blamed for shocking events. However, she also suggests it is possible they\u00a0can exert an influence too. \u201cSometimes people use folklore as a scapegoat, perhaps most famously in the Satanic Panic of the 1980s. \u201cBut we would be remiss to assume that folklore is safe or benign.\u201d","label":2,"__index_level_0__":9375,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"On 31 May 2014,\u00a0three 12-year-old girls embarked on a \u201cbirdwatching\u201d expedition in a\u00a0wooded area near their homes in Waukesha, Wisconsin that\u00a0ended\u00a0in one of them being stabbed 19 times and left for dead.

Although much more widely known as a real estate developer and business magnate rather than an entertainer, Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump was awarded a star on Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame in 2007 for his work on the popular reality series The Apprentice. (Critics contend that the real reason Trump has a Hollywood star is because the Walk of Fame is primarily about popularity and publicity, and money and influence count for far more than than actual achievement in determining who is to be so honored.)

After all, having unprotected sex with someone who is HIV-positive does not automatically mean that the disease will spread: A heterosexual person infected with HIV will transmit the virus to their partner once in every 900 times the couple has unprotected sex, according to a new study conducted in Africa. However, the exact number of sexual acts that are needed to transmit the virus can vary tremendously depending on the amount of the virus in the infected person\u2019s blood, said study researcher James Hughes, of the University of Washington in Seattle. Unless this anonymous woman accompanied her victims to the hospital after every sexual encounter for testing after a set period of time, there\u2019s no way she would know how many people she had given HIV.

How can a university student who has classes and assignments have time to f**k 3 dudes in one day.

I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans.\"\" We wondered if Republican nominee Donald Trump has proposed or supports privatization of the health care system for U.S. veterans. Trump, for the record, addressed the question head on when it was his turn to answer questions. \"\"I never said take the VA -- take the Veterans administration -- private.\"\" \"\"I wouldn\u2019t do that,\"\" Trump added. \"\"I do believe, when you're waiting in line six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the (private) doctor, you get yourself taken care of.\"\" Trump's comments are consistent with what he's said before, and Clinton's concerns about privatization are a misleading Democratic talking point. In July, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that \"\"Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization\"\" of the VA. What we found then, and what holds now, is that Trump wants to give veterans access to private providers when they face delays at the VA. That's not the same as privatization. When we contacted Clinton's campaign about her statement, spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us several references where Trump's plan has been characterized as some degree of privatization and Trump\u2019s explicit promise to give veterans the chance to go elsewhere for care. \"\"Every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care. Every veteran,\"\" Trump pledged in a July 11, 2016, speech in Virginia Beach, Va. \"\"Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all veterans, not just those who can\u2019t get an appointment in 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is, unfortunately, the current and wrong policy.\"\" The logistics of how that would work, of course, are another matter. Trump has spoken of letting VA patients go to any doctor or health care facility that accepts Medicare and getting treatment there immediately. The VA would pay for the bill. Experts we spoke with raised several issues with Trump\u2019s plan and also debated whether Trump's plan should be considered a type of partial privatization. One concern is that non-VA providers don\u2019t have the same level of experience that the VA has with treating veteran's health issues \u2014 including combat injuries, combat-related illnesses and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. There's also concern that letting veterans go anywhere for their care would result in fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care.

You go out, you see the (private) doctor, you get yourself taken care of.\"\" Trump's comments are consistent with what he's said before, and Clinton's concerns about privatization are a misleading Democratic talking point. In July, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that \"\"Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization\"\" of the VA. What we found then, and what holds now, is that Trump wants to give veterans access to private providers when they face delays at the VA. That's not the same as privatization. When we contacted Clinton's campaign about her statement, spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us several references where Trump's plan has been characterized as some degree of privatization and Trump\u2019s explicit promise to give veterans the chance to go elsewhere for care. \"\"Every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care. Every veteran,\"\" Trump pledged in a July 11, 2016, speech in Virginia Beach, Va. \"\"Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all veterans, not just those who can\u2019t get an appointment in 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is, unfortunately, the current and wrong policy.\"\" The logistics of how that would work, of course, are another matter. Trump has spoken of letting VA patients go to any doctor or health care facility that accepts Medicare and getting treatment there immediately. The VA would pay for the bill. Experts we spoke with raised several issues with Trump\u2019s plan and also debated whether Trump's plan should be considered a type of partial privatization. One concern is that non-VA providers don\u2019t have the same level of experience that the VA has with treating veteran's health issues \u2014 including combat injuries, combat-related illnesses and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. There's also concern that letting veterans go anywhere for their care would result in fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care. Our ruling Clinton said Donald Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Affairs health care system. Trump does support allowing more privatized care in cases where treatment at the VA is delayed or inadequate. In some cases he's talked about giving veterans a choice that would include doctors and hospitals outside the system. But that's not the same as privatizing the system, which would get the get the government out of the treatment business. Trump has never proposed that. Because Clinton's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression,\", and claim \"\"Hillary Clinton Says Donald Trump supports \"\"an agenda out there\"\" to privatize the Veterans Affairs\u00a0health care system.\"\". Please explain why the claim is False.","explanation_llama":"The claim that Hillary Clinton made is False because Trump's plan is not to privatize the VA system, but rather to give veterans access to private providers when they face delays at the VA. Trump's plan would allow veterans to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or a private medical center, but would not eliminate the VA system."}

The release also includes some useful caveats regarding the quality of evidence and what additional research needs to be done before lithium can be considered a viable option in humans. A bit more information about the actual research findings and potential harms of lithium would have been helpful. Parkinson\u2019s disease is primarily a disease of the late middle-aged and elderly population. At the moment there are between 500,000 and 1,500,000 people in the US with the disease and approximately 60,000 are diagnosed annually. Although there are now numerous innovative approaches to managing symptoms, dopamine replacement therapy is the dominant treatment. As noted in the news release, the effects of dopamine replacement on the classic symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s are frequently replaced by a set of equally crippling movement disorders. An inexpensive and low-risk solution for the treatment related movement disorders would be a welcomed option for sufferers of the disease and their families","premise":"After a misleading headline, the release establishes quickly that the research is in mice and that clinical trials haven\u2019t been performed.

Are there reasonable alternatives to Botox for some of the conditions it treats?

There is extraordinary variability in the quality of the research on Botox from one medical condition to another\u2014missing information important for a national audience that inevitably includes people searching desperately for solutions to intractable problems. For example, our quick literature search turned up more than a score of randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews on the use of Botox for the involuntary muscle contortions that cause the painful neck disorder known as cervical dystonia\u2013and just one, very small, inadequate trial on Botox treatments for low back pain. The story fails to quantify side effects, most of which seem to be dismissed as transient. And readers might be better served if the story put more meat on the bones of alternative approaches (including no treatment) to some of the conditions Botox treats.

Gwen Moore defended the health care law. On MSNBC\u2019s \"\"Disrupt with Karen Finney\"\" show, the Milwaukee Democrat described how bad women have had it -- and how things will improve with the Affordable Care Act. She stated: \"\"If you\u2019re a victim of domestic violence, even that\u2019s seen as a pre-existing condition. Women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender rating.

Pre-existing conditions In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama made a statement similar to the first part of Moore\u2019s claim. She said it was legal in some states to regard domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and use it as a basis for denying health insurance coverage. PolitiFact National rated Obama\u2019s statement True because at the time, eight states permitted treating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center. The law center told us that its most recent check, in 2010, showed the District of Columbia as well as six states -- Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming -- had no law prohibiting the insurers from designating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. However, there were restrictions in some of those states. (The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, also referred us to the law center on this question.) In rating Michelle Obama\u2019s statement, our colleagues pointed out that just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole. Indeed, an insurer might deny a woman coverage based on an injury or condition without it being disclosed that the injury or condition was a result of domestic violence. There was evidence in the 1990s that using domestic violence to deny coverage was widespread, but the law center told us it is not aware of any data on how many insurance companies actually use domestic violence now as a pre-existing condition. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act will prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems, such as high blood pressure, depression or diabetes, as well as \"\"conditions arising out of domestic violence.\"\" So, while there isn\u2019t evidence that health insurers commonly use domestic violence as a pre-existing condition to deny coverage, it is \"\"seen\"\" as such in that it is legal in a handful of states for health insurers to do so. Moore is also correct that practice is being outlawed under Obamacare. \"\"Gender rating\"\" The second part of Moore\u2019s claim is that women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of \"\"gender rating.\"\" There\u2019s no dispute that health insurers use gender as one factor in setting rates; others include age, family size, geographic region and health status. But Moore\u2019s broad claim that women pay 50 percent higher rates isn\u2019t so clear. Moore cited a March 2012 report, again from the National Women\u2019s Law Center. The center said it used the eHealthInsurance website to calculate premiums in the individual market -- in other words, premiums for women who purchase health insurance themselves, rather than getting it through their employer or spouse. The individual market is a key target of the Affordable Care Act. The center said premiums were at least 50 percent higher for women than for men in a number of instances, including health plans for 25-year-olds in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming; and for 40-year-olds in Alabama, Arizona, Kansas and Kentucky. Although federal anti-discrimination protections enacted prior to the Affordable Care Act generally prohibit employers from charging female employees higher premiums than male employees, businesses with predominantly female workforces are routinely charged more for group coverage, according to the law center. The reform law prohibits gender rating, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. So, there is evidence that some women buying health insurance in the individual market, a key target of Obamacare, are charged 50 percent more than men for the same coverage.

{"claim_id":"11002","hypothesis":"Popular Bone Drugs Linked to Reduced Colon Cancer Risk","explanation_1":"One can tell a lot about how a story is going to be from its lead quote. This HealthDay story on a new study indicating potential cancer prevention benefits from bone density drugs \u2014\u00a0quoted Dr. Gad Rennert, the study\u2019s lead author, sounding \u201cThese [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers. \u2026\u00a0This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins.\u201d From there on, Rennert is allowed to pump up the benefits of these drugs and to sweep aside any concern about their risks or broad application to a large population. Contrast that with the Reuters Health story which chose to quote\u00a0Eric Jacobs from the American Cancer Society saying, \u201cThe lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing\u2026.However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies.\u201d From that point on, the story took a cautious, objective look at the study\u2019s findings. We wish both stories had done a better job parsing the evidence, but we think that, overall, Reuters Health provided better context for readers. Roughly 1 out of every 20 people in the US will develop colorectal cancer at current rates. If taking a simple pill for $10 a month can keep cancer at bay, the world would be a much better place. Because solutions to significant health challenges are usually not that simple, this story and others that covered the same study should have been more cautious in explaining the results and showing readers why they might not translate to an immediate benefit for them.","premise":"Unlike the Reuters Health story, this story did not discuss costs. This is a shame because if the monthly cost is $10, as Reuters Health notes, that may be cheap on an individual level. As a public health policy, though, $120 a year across a huge population could add significantly to an already overspent health care system. The lead says, \u201cPeople who take drugs called bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss may also reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by almost 60 percent compared to those not on the drugs, a new study suggests.\u201d What this story and the Reuters Health story failed to do was give the raw numbers that are provided in the study itself. The story should have said that 138 women in the non-cancer group took biophosphonates and 97 in the cancer group took them, meaning that 41 women appear to have benefited from taking the drugs. If the study had found that 97 women had taken these drugs in both groups, the study would not have made headlines. Also, it might have been helpful to show that there were actually larger differences in some of the other factors that were studied. For example, 120 women in the group of cancer patients had a history of colorectal cancer in the family compared to 75 women in the control group. This story did a better job of mentioning \u201cThe magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study\u2026\u201d But then it goes on to say that the magnitude of the benefit is similar to cholesterol lowering medicines. The main difference is that this story, despite the caveats mentioned, is more enthusiastic about the findings than the Reuters story. We give this story and the Reuters Health story credit for at least mentioning some of the risks of taking bisphosphonates. \u201cThe researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue). Bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\u201d But neither story quantified the harms in any way. This story also failed to point out, as the Reuters Health story did, that \u201cearlier study from the UK had found no link between bisphosphonate and colon cancer. Indeed, it found a higher risk of throat cancer in patients on the medication.\u201d  The story makes a good attempt at explaining the quality of the evidence. It says, \u201cFor the study, Rennert\u2019s team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel\u2026.The researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.\u201d The story added a nice detail missed by Reuters Health, saying, \u201cThe findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect \u2014 that is, the study doesn\u2019t prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.\u201d\u00a0But both stories fail to point out that this study did not look at 933 women who took the drugs and 933 who did not. Of those 1,866 women, only 97 of the cancer patients took the drugs, and only 138 of the women without cancer had taken them. So, yes, the researchers were able to find what appears to be a statistically significant risk reduction, but they also found differences in physical activity, body mass index, vegetable intake and the use of statins and aspirin. The study highlights the biophosphonate connection, but the story should have explained why a difference of 41 women without cancer taking these drugs out of a total of nearly 2,000 would be enough evidence to support some of the cheerleading in the story. Though this story, in some ways, provided more information on the quality of the evidence, it too missed the point that the biggest limitation of the study is that factors related to the women\u2019s underlying risk of cancer were lower in those taking bisphosphonates, and that the authors did not collect adequate information to control for those differences. This is why one needs a randomized trial. And the mention that such a study should be \u201crelatively easy\u201d to do is not likely to be true. One will need a very large population to detect any difference on top of routine screening with a colonoscopy. One cannot do a study and not offer the control patients current standard of care. That means everyone needs to be screened first. This will be a very hard, expensive study to do. Neither story engaged in disease-mongering. Both stories quoted the exact same sources: the lead author and\u00a0Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. But both stories used their comments in very different ways. The Reuters Health story did not allow Rennert to run wild with enthusiasm. The HealthDay story did. For example, when the story notes that \u201cA randomized trial is needed to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said.\u201d It follows that sobering bit of news up immediately with, \u201cIt should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,\u201d he said. Should be relatively easy? Ask any drug company how much time it takes and what it costs to bring a drug to market and no one will tell you that clinical trials are easy. This is especially troubling given that a previous study just last year showed no benefit, and, remember, we are talking about just 41 women who appear to have staved off cancer by taking these drugs. Both stories relied on Jacobs from the American Cancer Society for the same bit of context. \u201cFortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal\u00a0cancer, he said. \u201cIn particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.\u201d Both stories make it clear that these are drugs currently on the market. This story provided even more detail, saying, \u201cBisphosphonates include such common drugs as Fosamax (alendronate), Boniva (ibandronate), Actonel (risedronate) and Reclast (zoledronic acid). These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\u201d This story made it clear that the findings are part of a series of findings, some of them contradictory, about the side benefits of different drugs for cancer prevention. It says, for example, \u201cHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert.\u201d  Neither story relied on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":7176,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"Unlike the Reuters Health story, this story did not discuss costs.

Though this story, in some ways, provided more information on the quality of the evidence, it too missed the point that the biggest limitation of the study is that factors related to the women\u2019s underlying risk of cancer were lower in those taking bisphosphonates, and that the authors did not collect adequate information to control for those differences. This is why one needs a randomized trial. And the mention that such a study should be \u201crelatively easy\u201d to do is not likely to be true. One will need a very large population to detect any difference on top of routine screening with a colonoscopy. One cannot do a study and not offer the control patients current standard of care. That means everyone needs to be screened first. This will be a very hard, expensive study to do. Neither story engaged in disease-mongering. Both stories quoted the exact same sources: the lead author and\u00a0Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. But both stories used their comments in very different ways. The Reuters Health story did not allow Rennert to run wild with enthusiasm. The HealthDay story did. For example, when the story notes that \u201cA randomized trial is needed to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said.\u201d It follows that sobering bit of news up immediately with, \u201cIt should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,\u201d he said. Should be relatively easy? Ask any drug company how much time it takes and what it costs to bring a drug to market and no one will tell you that clinical trials are easy. This is especially troubling given that a previous study just last year showed no benefit, and, remember, we are talking about just 41 women who appear to have staved off cancer by taking these drugs. Both stories relied on Jacobs from the American Cancer Society for the same bit of context. \u201cFortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal\u00a0cancer, he said. \u201cIn particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.\u201d Both stories make it clear that these are drugs currently on the market. This story provided even more detail, saying, \u201cBisphosphonates include such common drugs as Fosamax (alendronate), Boniva (ibandronate), Actonel (risedronate) and Reclast (zoledronic acid). These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\u201d This story made it clear that the findings are part of a series of findings, some of them contradictory, about the side benefits of different drugs for cancer prevention. It says, for example, \u201cHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert.\u201d  Neither story relied on a news release.\", and claim \"Popular Bone Drugs Linked to Reduced Colon Cancer Risk\". Please explain why the claim is Partially true and false.","explanation_llama":"Partially true:\n\n* The study suggests that taking bisphosphonates may reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer by almost 60%.\n* The study found that 41 women appeared to have benefited from taking the drugs.\n\nFalse:\n\n* The claim implies that the study found a direct causal link between taking bisphosphonates and reduced colon cancer risk, but the study only found an association and cannot confirm a causal effect.\n* The story failed to provide sufficient context and limitations of the study, including the small sample size and potential biases."}
{"claim_id":"9841","hypothesis":"Experimental Treatment May Help Relieve Back Pain","explanation_1":"The story presents the results of a trial examining outcomes of patients with a disc herniation treated with a spinal injection of ozone and steroids. Because the story describes results presented at a meeting, it lacks details that are important to assess the quality of the study. Patients in this study had symptoms that weren\u2019t improving with conservative treatment and were thought to be candidates for a steroid injection or surgery. Instead, they received a single injection of a combination of ozone gas and steroids. Six month outcomes are described \u2013 about a third had complete pain relief, another third had partial pain relief, 20% had little pain relief and 7% had no pain relief or were worse. Though promising, these results may be no better and possibly worse than steroid injections alone and probably worse than for surgery. Disc herniations can cause pain that radiates from the low back or buttocks into the legs, often below the knee \u2013 commonly called sciatica. Though the story refers to disc herniations as causing low back pain, leg symptoms are often more bothersome to patients than the back pain itself. Treatments for disc herniations such as surgery are also generally better at relieving leg than back pain. For most patients with sciatica due to a disc herniation, the natural history is one of improvement over time. The body has the ability to shrink the disc material that is irritating the nerves that are causing the pain. However, some patients continue to have symptoms and these are the ones addressed in this study. Though not clear from the story, there are good treatments available for these patients. The standard of care for patients with persistent and bothersome symptoms for more than 6 weeks is surgical discectomy. It is common that patients may undergo an injection of steroids into the area where the disc is inflaming the nerve as an alternative to surgery. However, it is not clear that this results in outcomes that are the same or better than going directly to surgery. Indeed there is little data to suggest that steroid injections decrease the need for subsequent surgery. With this background, the current study seeks to examine whether adding ozone to a steroid injection improves pain in patients with a disc herniation who aren\u2019t getting better. The major problem is that the reader does not know whether the outcomes seen are as good as those with a steroid injection or surgery. The study didn\u2019t compare these treatments, nor did the story describe the results of studies from patients with a steroid injection without ozone or surgery. If the story did, it would have to state that the outcomes may be similar but don\u2019t appear to be better. With that context, the value of this treatment would appear less certain that implied.","premise":"Though this is still an experimental approach, it would have been appropriate to discuss the costs in terms of the closest similar treatment \u2013 an epidural steroid injection. Since the story claims the experimental approach has been used thousands of times in Europe, some cost frame of reference was possible. The story did a good job explaining the benefits observed in this study. However, where it fell short was in comparing these outcomes to those that may be expected with alternative treatments \u2013 specifically, an epidural steroid injection alone or disc surgery. The story explained that no side effects were observed and that a small percent of patients had more pain after the injection. Bu the story does not talk about the potential risks of ozone gas to individuals as well as the environment. Ozone is a toxic gas and one would expect that the benefit of its use as a medical treatment would need to be clearly demonstrated prior to recommending it as a routine treatment option. Even if that is done, one would want to know that this gas can be safely generated and administered without causing toxicity to those administering it and to the environment itself. In this context, the mention of no risks seen in the study needs to be taken with considerable caution. The story did an adequate job explaining the preliminary nature of the results and that further research is needed before this can be considered for routine use. (But we think it could have done a better job of directly addressing supporters\u2019 claims that the new approach \u201ccould become a standard treatment.\u201d This came in the third paragraph. More conservative statements came much later.) It also described that the outcomes could be due to the ozone, the steroid,\u00a0a combination of both or just the favorable natural history of a disc herniation. What the story didn\u2019t do as well is describe outcomes of current treatments that would be alternatives. Though the story made the important point that the natural history of many disc herniations is to improve on their own with time, the story made an incorrect statement. By saying that, \u201cAs\u00a0many as 80% of adults in the U.S. suffer from lower back pain at some point in their lives, and for many, the cause is a herniated disc,\u201d it implies incorrectly that disc herniations are a common cause of low back pain. It isn\u2019t. In fact, only a\u00a0small percent of patients with low back pain have a disc herniation as the cause. It is true that patients with pain radiating into the leg are more likely to have a disc herniation, but this was not stated and most patients with low back pain do not have associated leg pain. The story quotes a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and it is implied but not stated that this person was not associated with the study. The spokesman provided important context. Though the study described alternative treatments, it didn\u2019t actually state how the results reported here compare. A key deficiency of this study is that it didn\u2019t compare the treatment to common alternatives. Since there are good treatments available for herniated discs that aren\u2019t getting better on their own with conservative treatment, one can only comment on the current results in comparison to these alternatives.

{"claim_id":"38662","hypothesis":" Social media posts show images of burgers and fries from McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals that sat untouched for years without decomposing, rotting or growing mold. ","explanation_1":"McDonald\u2019s Hamburgers Won't Rot for Years","premise":"McDonald\u2019s food won\u2019t decompose or rot for years if its stored in moisture-free conditions, but the same is true for most foods. Claims that food from McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals won\u2019t decompose after sitting untouched for years go back at least 20 years. They\u2019re usually used to argue that food from McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains are packed with artificial preservatives that render them unable to rot, which means that they are unnatural, unhealthy food options. One of the first and most well documented accounts of forever burgers came from Karen Hanrahan, the administrator of the wellness site Best of Mother Earth. In teaching a workshop titled \u201cHealthy Choices for Children,\u201d Hanrahan famously used a McDonald\u2019s hamburger from 1996 that hadn\u2019t decayed as a prop to demonstrate that there are healthier food options available for children. In 2008, Hanrahan blogged: This is a hamburger from McDonalds that I\u00a0purchased in 1996. That was 12 years ago. Note that it looks exactly like it did the very day I\u00a0bought it. The flecks on the burger are crumbs from the\u00a0bun. The burger is starting to crumble a bit. It has the oddest smell. The Happy Meal Art Project is another example of the un-decomposing McDonald\u2019s burger in popular culture. Its creators photographed a McDonald\u2019s burger every day for 137 days, noting the lack of decomposition. Similar examples can be found across the web, and especially on social media sites. Lucky for us, Serious Eats has logged some serious research. The website documented how nine different burgers \u2014 different varieties made at\u00a0home and by McDonald\u2019s \u2014 decomposed. After being left in open air for 25 days, all burgers showed little sign of decomposition or rot: Well, well, well.

Claims that food from McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals won\u2019t decompose after sitting untouched for years go back at least 20 years. They\u2019re usually used to argue that food from McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains are packed with artificial preservatives that render them unable to rot, which means that they are unnatural, unhealthy food options. One of the first and most well documented accounts of forever burgers came from Karen Hanrahan, the administrator of the wellness site Best of Mother Earth. In teaching a workshop titled \u201cHealthy Choices for Children,\u201d Hanrahan famously used a McDonald\u2019s hamburger from 1996 that hadn\u2019t decayed as a prop to demonstrate that there are healthier food options available for children. In 2008, Hanrahan blogged: This is a hamburger from McDonalds that I\u00a0purchased in 1996. That was 12 years ago. Note that it looks exactly like it did the very day I\u00a0bought it. The flecks on the burger are crumbs from the\u00a0bun. The burger is starting to crumble a bit. It has the oddest smell. The Happy Meal Art Project is another example of the un-decomposing McDonald\u2019s burger in popular culture. Its creators photographed a McDonald\u2019s burger every day for 137 days, noting the lack of decomposition. Similar examples can be found across the web, and especially on social media sites. Lucky for us, Serious Eats has logged some serious research. The website documented how nine different burgers \u2014 different varieties made at\u00a0home and by McDonald\u2019s \u2014 decomposed. After being left in open air for 25 days, all burgers showed little sign of decomposition or rot: Well, well, well.

Few tumors are caught early; those that are can be successfully treated with surgery. However, some patients are not eligible for surgery for various reasons. For them, radiation may not cure the cancer but may control it for some time. A new type of radiation, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) provides targeted, highly-focused radiation treatment to the tumor while leaving the surrounding tissue intact, important for those whose lung function may already be compromised. A small pilot study published in this week\u2019s Journal of the American Medical Association found that SBRT provided improvements in 3-year survival compared to what other studies have shown is achieved with\u00a0conventional radiation. However, because this was a small, single-institution\u00a0study with no direct comparison to other treatments, some caution must be taken in interpreting the results. This story could have been improved in the following ways:  By discussing costs \u2013 given how experimental the treatment is, insurance\u00a0may not cover the procedure. By commenting on the quality of the evidence \u2013 while the results are compelling and encouraging, this was a small, single-institution, non-controlled trial, meaning there was no comparison made to any other treatments. This makes the\u00a0interpretation of the results very difficult. By further describing the harms of treatment \u2013 the story indicates that 16% experienced significant but non-deadly side effects of treatment. What side effects? How significant? By quoting independent experts \u2013 the story does not quote any sources other the lead author of the study. Independent experts could have provided some much-needed perspective on the importance\u00a0of the new findings.

The key words here are \"\"preliminary\"\"\u00a0and \"\"potentially\"\" \u2013 the best this article did was insert the tiny word \"\"may\"\" in the first line when referring to the fact that this treatment \"\"may control\"\" this cancer better than currently available treatment. Readers shouldn\u2019t have such a hard time seeing the reality. Without it, one can see desperate patients and families clamouring for insurers or the government to pay for this lifesaving treatment.

Olbermann told viewers that the resolution -- which invoked the name of former President Ronald Reagan six times in its preamble -- would have effectively blackballed Reagan himself had it been in place during his political career. By Olbermann's count, the late conservative icon would have scored a measly four out of 10 -- just half of the eight he would have needed to secure financial backing from the party. As we looked at the Republican proposal, we were struck by how specific its 10 items are to today's political environment. Reagan didn't have to consider wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the prospect of gay marriage, for example. As a result, just a few of the checklist items can be directly compared to the issues Reagan faced, first during two terms as California governor and then as a two-term president. Because of this uncertainty, we won't rate Reagan -- or Olbermann -- in detail on each of the 10 issues. But if three problematic issues for Reagan exist, we think it's fair to say that he'd lose funds under the terms of today's proposal. We'll start by pointing out the one issue of the 10 that presents a clear case of Reagan overstepping today's Republican orthodoxy: \u00a0 \u2022 \"\"We support legal immigration and assimilation into American society by opposing amnesty for illegal immigrants.\"\" In 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which provided a path to amnesty for illegal immigrants who could prove that they had been in the United States for a certain period of time. Case closed. In the meantime, we settled upon six issues that we don't think can be used as fair comparisons, even though Olbermann did cite a few of them as examples of Reagan's unorthodox behavior on related issues. They are: \u00a0 \u2022 \"\"We support market-based health care reform and oppose Obama-style government-run health care.\"\" \u2022 \"\"We support market-based energy reforms by opposing cap and trade legislation.\"\" \u2022 \"\"We support workers\u2019 right to secret ballot by opposing card check.\"\" \u2022 \"\"We support victory in Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting military-recommended troop surges.\"\" \u2022 \"\"We support containment of Iran and North Korea, particularly effective action to eliminate their nuclear weapons threat.\"\" \u2022 \"\"We support retention of the Defense of Marriage Act.\"\" While health care, energy policy, labor rights, military strategy, foreign affairs and gay rights were issues in Reagan's day just as they are today, we concluded that the battles in Reagan's time, and in ours, had enough unique factors that it's impossible to be sure what his actions then would have meant about the policy debates of today. That leaves three issues to determine whether Olbermann is right that Reagan would have been denied GOP funding. One is: \u00a0 \u2022 \"\"We support protecting the lives of vulnerable persons by opposing health care rationing and denial of health care and government funding of abortion.\"\" Six months into his governorship in 1967, Reagan signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act, which has been widely described as the most liberal abortion law in the nation before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in  Roe vs. Wade  . Among other things, it permitted California's government-run Medicaid program to pay for abortions. \"\"Reagan later admitted that abortion had been 'a subject I\u2019d never given much thought to,'\"\" wrote Paul Kengor and Patricia Clark Doerner, co-authors of \"\"The Judge: William P. Clark, Ronald Reagan\u2019s Top Hand\"\" in the  National Review  , a conservative magazine. \"\"Moreover, his aides were divided on the question. ... Years later, Reagan remarked that he did 'more studying and soul searching' on the issue than any other as governor.\"\" Ultimately, Kengor and Doerner wrote, Reagan signed the bill, fearing that the Legislature would be able to override his veto and pass an even more sweeping measure. But that was far from the end of the story. Reagan biographer Lou Cannon told PolitiFact that \"\"one of the reasons that Reagan became an opponent of abortion is that so many abortions were performed under the Therapeautic Abortion Act of 1967\"\" -- more, even, than the bill's sponsors had envisioned. So, during the remainder of his political career, Reagan used his bully pulpit aggressively to oppose abortion. His presidential administration made some tangible antiabortion moves, such as instituting the \"\"Mexico City policy,\"\" which denied foreign aid funding to groups that \"\"perform or actively promote\"\" abortion. The second is: \u00a0 \u2022 \"\"We support the right to keep and bear arms by opposing government restrictions on gun ownership.\"\" As governor in 1967, Reagan signed the Mulford Act, which forbade the carrying of weapons in public. Later, in a 1991 speech, the former president spoke in favor of the Brady Bill -- a measure aggressively opposed by gun-rights groups that would establish a waiting period for gun purchases, so that law enforcement officials could conduct a background check on the purchaser. The law was named for Reagan's former press secretary, James Brady, who was seriously injured in John Hinckley's 1981 attempt on Reagan's life. (The bill was first introduced in Congress in 1987 and never made it to Reagan's desk during his presidency; Bill Clinton eventually signed it in 1993.) Despite these two actions, Reagan, as president, was generally a supporter of gun rights. Upon his death in 2004, the National Rifle Association eulogized him as a \"\"hunter, rancher and outdoorsman,\"\" as a life member of the group, and as the first sitting president to address the NRA at an annual meeting. In addition, he signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, which included some provisions that tightened rules on gun ownership but which also eased many existing rules on firearms. It is generally considered a victory for the NRA rather than for gun-control forces. On both guns and abortion, then, Reagan unquestionably broke with today's Republican orthodoxy on one or more occasions -- but he also did things that were fully consistent with that orthodoxy. Finally, we'll look at the item dealing with fiscal policy. It's a bit complicated because it contains four parts: \u00a0 \u2022 \"\"We support smaller government, smaller national debt, lower deficits and lower taxes by opposing bills like Obama\u2019s 'stimulus' bill\"\"  Reagan gets unalloyed credit for sticking to the Republican principle of lowering taxes. When he entered office, the top marginal income tax rate was 70 percent. By the time he left office, it was 28 percent. Measured another way  , the effective individual income tax rates dropped for Americans in many tax brackets, not just the richest. Judging whether Reagan promoted \"\"smaller government\"\" is trickier. For starters, \"\"smaller government\"\" could be defined to include such intangible factors as decreased regulation rather than just federal outlays. But even looking at federal spending, the trendlines are somewhat contradictory. Overall federal outlays increased by 57 percent over eight years, or about 7 percent a year. However, much of that increase was driven by defense spending. Looking at nondefense discretionary spending, the rise was much more modest -- 16 percent over eight years, or about 2 percent a year. Because that was less than the average rate of inflation during his presidency, some economists would consider that a cut. That said, it's pretty clear that Reagan didn't stick to the other two elements of this item -- deficits and debt. The average annual deficit during Reagan's presidency was $167 billion, with shortfalls ranging from $79 billion to $221 billion. By contrast, his two immediate predecessors, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford never ran a deficit larger than $74 billion, and the president before them, Richard Nixon, never produced a deficit bigger than $23 billion. (Nixon even recorded a modest surplus in 1969.) As for the national debt, it rose from about $953 billion when Reagan took office to roughly $2.7 trillion when he left -- a bit less than three times its initial size. So on this item, too, both sides can pick and choose their evidence to show that Reagan did, or didn't, adhere to Republican fiscal orthodoxy. It's possible to draw at least two conclusions based on Reagan's example. One is that Reagan -- perhaps unhappily for ideologues on both the right and the left -- did not have immutable principles throughout his entire political life. He was a politician -- one who had to respond to his constituents, as well as to the specific demands and constraints of his office, whether it was governor or president. The other conclusion to draw is that parties themselves do not necessarily have immutable principles. Reagan's biographer Cannon points out that at the time the California Legislature passed the abortion bill, \"\"more Republicans supported it than Democrats. That's because the issue was then seen almost entirely in religious terms, and there were more Roman Catholics among the Democratic legislators than the Republicans. In 1967, most Republicans agreed with the mantra of keeping the government out of the bedroom and the boardroom. ... So Reagan went along with the prevailing doctrine of his party at the time.\"\" Similarly, when the Legislature passed the Mulford Act, it won the support not just of liberal gun-control advocates but also of conservatives, who saw it as a way to weaken the growing power of the radical Black Panther movement, according to  Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law, Volume 1  . When Reagan signed both the gun bill and the abortion bill, then, one can easily argue that he was actually adhering to the conservatism of the time, even as he bucked the conservatism of today. This contrast underscores the challenges facing Olbermann and others who seek to discredit the RNC proposal. Indeed, the lead sponsor of the RNC resolution, James Bopp Jr., acknowledged as much after liberal attacks like Olbermann's began to emerge. According to the  New York Times  ' Caucus blog, Bopp \"\"noted that the principles would change over time. ... Many of these were not issues in the 1980s, like cap and trade, card check, stimulus bill, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Obamacare. So these were not measures that Reagan took a stand on, but I have no doubt that he would be right on each one. If we were proposing this resolution in 1981 for the 1982 election cycle, we would list, strategic missile defense, Reagan\u2019s tax cuts, etc. He was right on those issues.\"\" But our mission here is not to critique the usefulness of Bopp's 10-point checklist; it's to judge whether Olbermann is right to say that Reagan would have fallen short on three or more items. On one item (amnesty for illegal immigrants) Reagan definitely broke with today's conservative orthodoxy. But on three others (abortion, gun control and fiscal policy) evidence exists in either direction. So, deciding whether Reagan qualifies under the rules of the resolution ends up being a tough call with evidence for both sides.\"","label":3,"__index_level_0__":7173,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"\"To enforce ideological purity, a proposal before the Republican National Committee would deny party funding to any GOP candidate who bucks the party's stance on at least three items from a 10-point checklist of issues.

There is likely to be a range of costs because of issues with the specific tumor\u00a0target. However, the release could have made note of that. The release is far more emphatic than the study. The release says focused radiation treatment alone proved to be \u201csubstantially less toxic\u201d than a combination of focused and whole brain radiation treatment for these brain tumor patients. By contrast, the study referred to \u201cless cognitive deterioration\u201d and lower rates of decline in the quality of life. However, the lack of detail about benefits in the release is largely due to the lack of detail in the study itself, which reported only on a combined measure of cognitive function and did not spell out specific benefits. The same can be said of the discussion of survival rates, because the study itself said only that there was no significant difference between the treatment groups. The release should have included a vital point: that few patients in either group lived more than a few months. Indeed, 20 percent had died before the first evaluation just three months after treatment. On the other hand, the release does a great service by highlighting the finding that although patients who received whole brain radiation in addition to focused radiation had better brain scan results, they did not live any longer than those whole were given only focused radiation treatment. The finding is yet another example of the danger of putting too much stock in measures of disease progression or other tests that logically seem to be related to important health outcomes, but often fall short. The main point of the release, emphasized in several statements, is that whole brain radiation is more toxic to the brain than focused (or stereotactic radiation) without improving survival outcomes. So, while one might expect that the more targeted approach might cause harm by \u201cmissing\u201d some of the cancer, the story does a good job of pointing out the\u00a0LACK of additional harm by targeting the tumor rather than irradiating the entire brain. The release does not describe the trial, either the features that make it noteworthy or its limitations. This ruling is a close call. Although the claim in the release that the study results could apply to tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors may be a reasonable estimate, it fails to put that number in context. The study included only a select group of patients with three or fewer metastases in their brains. By failing to mention either that one out of five patients in the trial died before the first post-treatment evaluation or that many patients with brain tumors don\u2019t match the description of those in the trial, readers are given an inflated sense of the relevance of these findings. The funding source is not identified in the release. The release also makes no mention of conflicts of interest, but the journal article disclosure section notes only that one of the authors (not mentioned in the release) receives some industry funding. The release is clear that the point of the study was a direct comparison of two commonly-used treatments. The release also points out that surgery is a treatment option for these patients. It is clear that the treatments are currently in general use. The release fails to tell readers that whole brain radiation for these patients is, as an accompanying editorial comment notes, \u201cfalling out of favor.\u201d The editorial goes on to note that, \u201cIn 2014, the American Society of Radiation Oncology\u2026 indicated that WBRT [whole brain radiation treatment] should not routinely be added to SRS [stereotactic radiosurgery or focused radiation] for patients with a limited number of brain metastases.\u201d So this research, informative to clinicians as it may be, is unlikely to change the underlying trend away from using whole brain radiation in the treatment of these patients. The release doesn\u2019t go overboard with sensational language. But as mentioned above, phrases such as \u201csubstantially less toxic\u201d and \u201cbetter quality of life\u201d without quantification, along with tangential promotion of related research by the institution\u2019s researchers, tilt the release toward marketing.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":3600,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"Since both the focused radiation and whole brain radiation are common treatments for brain tumors, an estimate of typical costs should have been included in the release.

However, the claim is exaggerated as it implies that the treatment is highly effective, whereas the study only reports a combined measure of cognitive function and survival rates without providing specific details. Additionally, the study only included a select group of patients with three or fewer metastases in their brains, which limits its generalizability."}
