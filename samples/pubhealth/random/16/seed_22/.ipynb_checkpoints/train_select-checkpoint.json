{"claim_id":"22143","hypothesis":"I\u2019ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning.","explanation_1":"Sen. Herb Kohl says he\u2019s never done any negative campaigning","premise":"\"Twenty-three years into his Senate tenure, Wisconsin\u2019s Herb Kohl hasn\u2019t announced whether he will seek another six-year term in 2012. But as Republicans step up their criticism of him, Kohl is making crystal clear his disdain for the kind of rough-and-tumble campaign environment that almost surely would be part of another campaign. Compared to his last couple races when Kohl used his massive personal fortune to vanquish underfunded opponents with soft-sell TV ads, it would be a new environment for the senator who owns the Milwaukee Bucks and built the Kohl\u2019s department and grocery store chains. In remarks to reporters in Madison on April 28, 2011, Kohl ruminated about the state of today\u2019s campaigns. He said \"\"people don\u2019t like anybody in public life\"\" because of \"\"venomous\"\" attacks and sniping among congressional members, something he said he engages in \"\"hardly at all.\"\" Then he got specific: \"\"I\u2019ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning. And I don\u2019t get into any personal jousts with other people in public life. But that\u2019s just my style.\"\" So has Kohl really avoided any negative campaigning? That\u2019s quite a claim in this age of mud-slinging and aggressive campaign tactics. We decided to check it out. Of course, it would be impossible to track down every campaign statement Kohl made since 1988 and copies of decades-old TV ads. So we focused our look-back to media descriptions of TV ads, debates and the candidates\u2019 strategies in his four races. We also talked to the people who should know best: several of his former opponents or their aides, Kohl\u2019s campaign staff, and a longtime political reporter. Kohl has of course benefited from negative attacks launched by groups supporting his campaigns, but he spoke only of his own campaigns\u2019 conduct, so we\u2019ll limit our review to that. One more note before we begin: Because there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes \"\"negative\"\" campaigning, we asked Team Kohl what exactly he meant by his claim. \"\"Sen. Kohl has said that he believes campaigning is about telling the people of Wisconsin what he\u2019s done and what he plans to do, not tearing down his opponent or telling people not to vote for them,\"\" Kohl press secretary Lynn Becker said. \"\"He has not been deliberately malicious or factually dishonest in his campaigns or while serving in public office.\"\" Indeed, his two most recent opponents said there was no negative campaigning in their contests -- and had high praise for Kohl. \"\"He never did anything negative in his campaign. He\u2019ll have the job as long as he wants the job,\"\" said John Gillespie, founder of Rawhide Boys Ranch, who lost to Kohl in 2000. \"\"Say hi to Herb if you talk to him. Tell him I owe him a dinner,\"\" said Robert Lorge, Kohl\u2019s 2006 rival. Fair enough. Those were landslide wins. What about the earlier contests? 1988: Kohl was a surprise entrant in the Democratic primary, winning the nomination comfortably over former Gov. Tony Earl, Ed Garvey and Doug La Follette. He frustrated his rivalsby limiting his debate participation and spending millions on TV ads. At the time, Earl\u2019s media consultant David Axelrod charged that Kohl\u2019s popular slogan -- \"\"Nobody\u2019s Senator But Yours\"\" -- was an implicit negative attack. It implied that candidates who -- unlike Kohl -- have to raise most of their campaign money are beholden to donors, said Axelrod, who later went on to help a guy named Barack Obama get elected president. Earl attacked Kohl as uninformed and error-prone, prompting Kohl campaign aide Bill Christofferson to call Earl \"\"desperate\"\" and guilty of misrepresentation. Insiders on both sides agree that Kohl ran no attack ads in the primary -- and none in the very tight general election that saw Republican state legislator Susan Engeleiter close the gap to just a few pointswith a series of ads targeting Kohl in the closing weeks. Engeleiter herself told us she has \"\"nothing but positive recollections\"\" of a \"\"pretty cordial campaign.\"\" She also praised Kohl\u2019s dealing with her when she later was confirmed as administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. La Follette and Garvey say today that they wouldn\u2019t call Kohl\u2019s primary race negative. Regarding Kohl\u2019s slogan, La Follette agreed with Kohl aide Christofferson, who said: \u00a0\"\"Herb Kohl was talking about himself, not anyone else, when he promised to be 'nobody's senator but yours.'\"\" Indeed, Kohl explicitly used his positive campaign ads as a selling point, and called his victory a blow against negative campaigning. 1994: In his first re-election campaign, Kohl wasted little time aggressively portraying Republican opponent Robert Welch, a state lawmaker from Redgranite, as an \"\"extreme conservative\"\" and flip-flopper. At an early debate, he cited Welch\u2019s no-exceptions stance against abortion and his vow never to vote for a tax hike as \"\"extreme.\"\" According to media accounts, he did not explain the flip-flop charge. Afterwards, Welch told reporters Kohl was \"\"nastier than I expected.\"\" Later, after Welch attempted to tie Kohl to President Clinton, Kohl launched a rare TV ad that focused on an opponent by name. Another followed. The ads accused Welch of distorting Kohl\u2019s record. One said that \"\"fellow Republicans\"\" had criticized Welch\u2019s tactics -- something deemed misleading in a Milwaukee Journal fact check. The exchange led Welch to accuse Kohl of running a \"\"multimillion dollar mudslinging campaign.\"\" Kohl said it was Welch who went negative. The rhetoric heated up. At one point in the race, after Welch accused Kohl of \"\"religion bashing,\"\" Kohl spokesman Jeffrey Gillis said that \"\" Welch's attack again shows that he'll say or do anything to get elected.\"\" So, that seems like quite a bit of snarling. Looking back, though, Welch\u2019s campaign manager Mike Maxwell doesn\u2019t have strong opinions about the back and forth. \"\"I don\u2019t know that Kohl was particularly negative through that election,\"\" he told us. He didn\u2019t recall the \"\"distort\"\" ad that Kohl ran. He did say that some might consider the \"\"extreme\"\" charge a negative attack. Kohl, Maxwell recalled, \"\"just had overwhelming resources and then he signed (Bucks first round draft choice Glenn Robinson) six days before the election.\"\" (We could not reach Welch for comment). Kenneth Lamke, a Milwaukee Sentinel reporter who covered the 1994 race, offered the strongest opinion we heard on whether Kohl went negative against Welch. He says yes. Lamke said the \"\"extreme\"\" charge by Kohl was \"\"within bounds but uncharacteristic of Herb.\"\" Lamke viewed the attack as unprovoked and an exaggeration; Gillis, the Kohl aide, said it was a response to the drumbeat of criticism of Kohl during the Republican primary. Lamke, we should note, asked us to describe his personal politics as \"\"leans Republican.\"\" We asked several political scientists to characterize the language of the Kohl ad. They reacted cautiously because we could not provide the ad itself, just direct quotes from it in media accounts. That makes it impossible to fully judge the tone. Vanderbilt professor John Geer, an author of a much-cited book on negative campaigning, said it sounded like a \"\"tame\"\" response ad -- \"\"not the kind of classic negative ad the public doesn\u2019t like.\"\" Darrell West, of the Brookings Institution, agreed. UW-Madison\u2019s Ken Goldstein said Kohl\u2019s ad met the academic research definition of \"\"negative\"\" because it focused on Welch, not Kohl. The test of whether it was unfair is whether it was accurate, he said. So Kohl\u2019s campaigns have been remarkably low-confrontation affairs, with the most notable exception being 1994, the first -- and perhaps only -- time Kohl aired TV spots going after an opponent. So how does Kohl fare on his statement that he has never campaigned negatively? Clearly, Kohl has spent the vast bulk of his time and money on upbeat, positive ads. Even his opponents agree strongly with that -- one even wants to buy him dinner. The only ad that pops up as arguably negative is the 1994 \"\"distort\"\" spot against Welch. It drew some critical attention, but is viewed as a pretty tame response ad. Beyond that, Kohl\u2019s campaigns have engaged in some labeling and name calling. And Kohl\u2019s aggressive 1994 portrayal of Welch as an \"\"extremist\"\" was arguably negative. Kohl is mostly on target here, with some minor exceptions. .\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":2410}

Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.\"","premise":"\"Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine \"\"Katty\"\" Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. \"\"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States,\"\" Kay said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \"\"Because when people really need it,\u00a0and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate.\"\" Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFact\u00a0and PolitiFact\u00a0busy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kay\u2019s claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kay\u2019s source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percent\u00a0for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine\u00a0in 2013, according to the WHO data. (The\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts\u00a0the measles immunization rate in the United States is\u00a091.9 percent. But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States 91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent  Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, it\u2019s not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States\u2019 include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a \"\"major public health success\"\" that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. \"\"I\u2019m old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available,\"\" Troisi said, \"\"and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason we\u2019re seeing this refusal is because parents haven\u2019t seen what these diseases can do.\"\" Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, \"\"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States.\"\" We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":6360}
{"claim_id":"27272","hypothesis":"\"A photograph showing an odd-looking, large bat with an elongated face known as a \"\"hammerhead bat.\"","explanation_1":"Images of the hammer-headed bat are often met with skepticism, and some viewers claim that this odd-looking creature could be the real-world animal responsible for various sightings of mythical creatures such as the \u201cNew Jersey Devil.\u201d","premise":"Digital editing has been responsible for the creation of images of some fantastically fictional looking creatures, such as seven-headed snakes, pink-horned rhinos, and impossibly small kittens. In July 2018, many social media users wondered if they were witnessing a similar creation in an image of an odd-looking, large animal said to be a \u201chammerhead bat\u201d:  We have not been able to pinpoint the exact origins of this photograph, but we can say that the hammerhead bat (also known as the \u201chammer-headed bat\u201d) is a genuine animal that looks like the one pictured here. The hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) is a megabat found in the tropical forests of central Africa. A profile on the large fruit bat from Bat Magazine provides some more information about this unusual-looking animal: The hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), widely distributed in equatorial Africa, is one of three species of African fruit bat thought to be asymptomatically infected with the Ebola virus; though scientists do not know if the species is an incidental host or a reservoir of Ebolavirus. The little-collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata) and the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the other two species. The species is locally common and is typically found in lowland tropical moist forests, riverine forests, swamp forests, mangroves and palm forests, where it roosts in trees. Although colonies up to 25 bats have been observed, the average hammer-headed fruit bat roost is fewer than five bats. The hammer-headed bat, with wingspans up to 38 inches (97 cm), is Africa\u2019s largest bat. Strong sexual dimorphism is observed in the species, as males are significantly larger than females. Males have a large head with enlarged rostrum, larynx and lips that allows for the production of loud honking calls; the appearance of females is similar to most other fruit bats. The species has a \u201clek\u201d mating system whereby a few hundred males gather into groups (leks) to attract female mates. Although the hammerhead bat is a relatively large bat, the viral image may have given some viewers a false impression of the animal\u2019s true size. The person holding this fruit bat is extending the animal out toward the camera, and since the bat is closer to the lens than the human, the forced perspective makes the animal appear larger than normal. Photographs exhibiting the forced perspective optical illusion have caused confusion about the relative sizes of frogs, rats, snakes, and half-eaten sharks. As noted by Bats Magazine, the hammer-headed bat can possess a wingspan of nearly 40 inches, but it\u2019s average body length is only about 10 inches: H. monstrosus is the largest bat found in Africa, with males being significantly larger than females. Males range in mass from 228 g to 450 g, averaging 377 g. Females are about half the size, weighing from 218 to 377 g, and averaging 275 g. Males range in length from 220 to 280 mm, with an average of 250 mm. Females measure 195 to 225 mm, averaging 210 mm. Males have a wingspan of 686 to 970 mm, and females have an average wingspan of 840 mm. We\u2019ve collected a few other images of the hammerhead bat for comparison:","label":0,"__index_level_0__":5305}
{"claim_id":"473","hypothesis":"Ring of fire: Australian state declares emergency as wildfires approach Sydney.","explanation_1":"Australia\u2019s most populous state declared its second emergency in as many months on Thursday as extreme heat and strong winds stoked more than 100 bushfires, including three major blazes on Sydney\u2019s doorstep.","premise":"A day after Australia recorded its hottest day on record, thick smoke blanketed the harbor city, shrouded the Opera House and brought many outdoor activities to a halt. The state of emergency declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities across New South Wales, which is home to more than 7 million people. Authorities said nearly 120 fires remained ablaze by late afternoon, more than half of which are uncontrolled, and with temperatures forecast to top 45 degrees Celsius (113\u00b0F) in some areas, officials warned residents to be on high alert. \u201cThe firefront has been spreading very quickly and intensely,\u201d NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney, adding that two firefighters had been airlifted to hospital with burns to their faces and airways. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very difficult and dangerous set of circumstances.\u201d  Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian advised people to make sure \u201cyou are prepared to change your plans should circumstances change.\u201d  In Shoalhaven, a popular coastal destination some 190 km (120 miles) south of Sydney, local mayor Amanda Findley said people were poised to evacuate. \u201cThere is a large amount of smoke looming over the city, which shows how close the fire is,\u201d Findley told Reuters by telephone. \u201cIt is extremely hot and windy now so we are all worried the fire could spread. People are really worried that they may lose everything.\u201d  The RFS posted footage on its official Twitter account showing firefighters tackling one of the three blazes ringing Sydney. A waterbomber aircraft was dwarfed by thick grey and black billowing cloud as it attempted to douse flames in bushland just meters away from homes. Australia has been battling wildfires across much of its east coast for weeks, leaving six people dead, more than 680 homes destroyed and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland burnt. Berejiklian said as many as 40 homes had been destroyed on Thursday. Australia on Wednesday broke all-time heat records for the second day running, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9 degree Celsius, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Some 1,700 firefighters have been deployed across NSW, but officials warned that was still not enough to cover every potential danger and urged people in high risk areas to evacuate while it was still safe to do so. The current state of emergency will last for seven days, while a total fire ban that has been in place since Tuesday will remain until midnight on Saturday. The major fires around Sydney, which is home to more than 5 million people, have resulted in days of heavy pollution in the city usually known for its sparkling harbor and blue skies. One megafire in the Kanangra Boyd National Park to the city\u2019s southwest had crept to the very outskirts of Campbelltown, a suburb of 157,000 people. By late afternoon, Sydney was sitting at No.4 on the IQAir AirVisual live rankings of pollution in global cities, above Dhaka, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta. Many commuters have donned breathing masks in recent weeks as air quality has plunged to hazardous levels not previously seen in the city. NSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan said the service had experienced a 10% surge in call-outs for patients suffering respiratory conditions over the past week and urged susceptible people to remain indoors and keep their medication close. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has weathered a storm of criticism on social media in recent days for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency, adding to criticism that his government is failing to deliver adequate climate change policies. As local media reported Morrison was in Hawaii on a family holiday, about 500 protesters gathered outside his official Sydney residence to demand urgent action on climate change. Morrison\u2019s office refused to confirm his whereabouts. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, \u201cScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?\u201d referencing the leader\u2019s nickname and a decade-old international advertisement for Tourism Australia that was banned in several countries because the language was deemed offensive. Australia\u2019s low-lying Pacific neighbors have been particularly critical of the coal-rich nation\u2019s climate policies following modest progress at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid. \u201cIt was particularly disappointing to see our Pacific cousins in Australia actively standing in the way of progress at a time when we have been watching in horror as their own country is ablaze,\u201d Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine said in a statement on Wednesday.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":5884}
{"claim_id":"7757","hypothesis":"Poland's wild boar cull prompts protests.","explanation_1":"Hunters and activists have united against the Polish government\u2019s decision to cull most of Poland\u2019s wild boar population in an effort to curtail health risks related to African swine fever (ASF).","premise":"\u201cThere is no scientific basis for this, it is barbarism,\u201d said Katarzyna Karpa-Swiderek, a spokeswoman for animal rights organization World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Poland. \u201cWe broadly do not protest against hunting wild boars, but in our opinion the scope of the proposed cull is excessive.\u201d  Estimates of Poland\u2019s wild boar population vary widely and range from at least 200,000 to one million. In December, the government called on all licensed hunters to kill most of the wild boar population in order to prevent the further spread of African swine fever. ASF is a highly contagious disease that affects pigs and wild boar and has spread in Eastern Europe in recent years. It does not affect humans. The European Commission said on Thursday that a wild boar cull is the only appropriate way of dealing with the spread of African swine fever, Polish state news agency PAP reported on Friday. Hunters, however, branded this an excessive measure. \u201cIt is not possible to call it anything other than an animal slaughter. A significant number of hunters do not approve of these activities (the\u00a0wild\u00a0boar\u00a0cull),\u201d said hunter Wojciech Metler. Thousands of opponents of the cull have shown their support by changing their Facebook profile photos to ones that feature an image of a wild boar. Poland\u2019s veterinary officials approved a plan to kill 185,000\u00a0wild\u00a0boars in the 2018\/2019 hunting season. In 2018 the Supreme Audit Office concluded most farms did not implement sufficient preventive measures to stem the spread of the disease, such as installing disinfection mats.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":593}
{"claim_id":"4654","hypothesis":"Rejected medical marijuana grower applicant sues Missouri.","explanation_1":"A southwest Missouri family that saw its application to grow medical marijuana rejected by the state is now suing the state, demanding a license to participate in Missouri\u2019s fledgling medical cannabis industry.","premise":"The lawsuit filed Friday by Paul Callicoat and his family, of Sarcoxie, Missouri, came a day after the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services granted 60 licenses  from the more than 500 companies that applied. The Callicoats, who had planned to open a cultivation facility called Sarcoxie Nursery, were not among those who won a license. The family\u2019s lawsuit argues the state\u2019s 60-license limit violates the state constitution\u2019s \u201cright to farm\u201d amendment passed by voters in 2014. The lawsuit also challenges the state\u2019s selection process that gave more points to businesses in high-unemployment ZIP codes, saying that \u201cgeographic bonus\u201d was announced after the family had already paid a non-refundable $10,000 application fee. The health department did not respond to a request by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for comment. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Monday. Missouri voters made medical marijuana legal in 2018.

{"claim_id":"27739","hypothesis":"\"A billboard that says \"\"Make America White Again\"\" is part of a political campaign.\"","explanation_1":"The Ballotpedia web site records that Tyler ran for the same office in 2014 and received 5,579 votes, or 0.4% of the total votes cast.","premise":"On 22 June 2016, a photograph purportedly showing a billboard for a Congressional candidate named Rick Tyler, bearing the slogan \u00a0\u201cMake America White Again\u201d along with pictures of various white American historical figures and a white family was widely circulated via social media: Although the image was also published by several legitimate news outlets, many viewers remained skeptical that anyone running for Congress would employ a slogan that seemed so blatantly racist. According to Nashville television station WSMV the \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard was put on display off of Highway 411 in Polk County, Tennessee, by independent Rick Tyler,& who is\u00a0running for a congressional seat in Tennessee\u2019s 3rd district that is currently held by Republican Chuck Fleischmann. A (since-deleted) statement posted by Tyler explained the rationale behind the billboard from his point of view and offered a preview of putative future campaign billboards:  The \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard advertisement will cut to the very core and marrow of what plagues us as a nation. As Anne Coulter so effectively elucidates in her book, Adios America, the overhaul of America\u2019s immigration law in the 1960\u2019s has placed us on an inevitable course of demise and destruction. Yes \u2026 the cunning globalist\/Marxist social engineers have succeeded in destroying that great bulwark against statist tyranny \u2026 the white American super majority. Without its expedited restoration little hope remains for the nation as a whole. The following are examples of other billboard designs we plan to bring forth in the coming months. We ask you to prayerfully consider putting meaningful financial support behind this brazen and determined crusade for truth. The controversial billboard was apparently taken down on 21 June 2016, and Tyler\u2019s campaign web site has also been inaccessible since then (possibly due to an unexpected crush of traffic. Tyler offered a lengthy response to the brouhaha engendered by his campaign billboard in a (since-removed) Facebook post:  Let me begin by thanking everyone that has gotten involved in the controversy spawned by the \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard on Highway 411 in Polk County. I am persuaded that the overwhelming majority of you are sincere and well intentioned. Obviously, there are the \u201cfrothing at the mouth lunatics\u201d who react in a completely irrational, emotional, Pavlovian dog fashion. Fortunately, they are a small percentage of the whole\u2014and even they are passionately sincere albeit ignorant, misguided and lacking in self control. A PREDICTABLE AND DESIRED RESPONSE Be assured, the response that has been engendered by the billboard is precisely what was expected and hoped for. You see\u2026 this is not a mere publicity stunt, but rather a calculated maneuver to dispense hardcore truth while simultaneously doing an end run around the iron curtain of censorship. As Orwell stated, \u201cIn a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u201d Unfortunately, a globalist cartel has long held power in our nation, and in effect, there has already been a soft revolution wherein lawful constitutional government has been supplanted by a rogue band of oligarchic criminals. Those who seek to set things aright are actually counter-revolutionaries, endeavoring to facilitate the restoration of lawful, constitutional government. Whether you realize it or not, you are all participating in this counter-revolutionary exercise irrespective of where you stand on the matter! Indeed, the brainwashing may well be too far advanced, and there may be no chance of restoration, rejuvenation, and revival in our once great nation. Like the watchman spoken of in Ezekiel 33, some of us must sound the warning of the advancing and ominous peril that is encroaching upon our civilization as a whole. Like Nineveh, there could be great repentance and revival in America. If not, we will succumb to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. For those who are posturing in a high and mighty stance of ostensible moral superiority, I would caution you against falling into the trap of modernism and the liberal watering down of truth. Your fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers would have been entirely sympathetic and supportive of the preservation of a white super majority in America. They would have been utterly hostile to the concept of the mass nonwhite immigration that has ensued over the past half century. They would have never acquiesced to the schemes of forced racial integration foisted upon the states by a usurpatious federal government. By capitulating on these and other related issues, you are dishonoring your fathers and mothers of old in a flagrant and treacherous violation of the 4th Commandment. In the fulness of time, God will surely hold you accountable for this violation of his sacred law. As Isaiah 5:20 states, \u201cWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\u201d AM I A RACIST? The charge of \u201cracism\u201d is the most flagrant and abusive canard of our time. Absurdly, those who bandie about the charge never bother to define its meaning. Is a racist one who harbors antipathy toward someone simply based on their ethnicity? If so only a foolish person would fit such a description. If, on the other hand, we are talking about someone who demonstrates greater affinity for his own racial family (your race is the extension of your biological family) then the charge would be truly preposterous. Ethnocentricity is completely healthy and normal and all races, except the white race, are encouraged to engage in and express it. The glaring double standard is all too obvious. ABOUT THE BILLBOARD\u2019S MESSAGE The \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard is a takeoff on Donald Trump\u2019s slogan of \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d In a nutshell, it is stating that the \u201cLeave It to Beaver, Ozzie and Harriet, Mayberry\u201d America of old was vastly superior to what we are experiencing today. It was an America where doors were left unlocked, violent crime was a mere fraction of today\u2019s rate of occurrence, there were no car jackings, home invasions, Islamic Mosques or radical Jihadist sleeper cells. Additionally, government was much smaller, responsible, and accountable to the people. Yes, that Norman Rockwell America was immensely preferable to the rapidly deteriorating culture now engulfing us. Only the ignorant and misguided would resist its restoration and resuscitation. As set forth on the Tyler for Congress website, (www.ricktylerforcongress.com) a moratorium on nonwhite immigration and the abolition of policies that subsidize nonwhite birth rates would be two constructive actions toward beginning the long journey back toward sanity and stability in our beleaguered and foundering nation. A WHITE SUPER MAJORITY It is no coincidence that every nation being inundated by the teeming multitudes of the third world is a white nation. It is indisputable that the white race has achieved infinitely more in the way of technology, culture and innovation than the nonwhite civilizations of history. The racial component of this phenomenon is all-important. In a blind, suicidal manner modern man overlooks this profound truth while plunging headlong toward destruction. SOUNDING THE CLARION CALL The Caucasian race has been inordinately blessed and favored by the God of scripture. It was among this people that the new covenant gospel of Jesus Christ took root, blossomed, and flourished. Western Christian civilization evolved in the ensuing centuries leading to the eventual rise of our beloved America of yesteryear. As time progressed however, our nation and people lost their way. America forsook the God of her fathers and turned to the false gods of the heathen world. Now we are a people under divine judgment with a very grim future staring us in the face. The Tyler for Congress candidacy is a last ditch effort to challenge the descendents of America\u2019s founders to \u201creturn to the ancient landmarks.\u201d Scattered throughout the land are the proverbial seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal. (I Kings 19:18) The remnant of God may not be large enough to facilitate restoration of that which has been lost\u2026 but we will proceed to carry the torch in the hope of miraculous and divine intervention. The incumbent lawyer and representative of the 3rd Congressional District voted for the 1.1 trillion dollar spending bill in December; which among many nefarious expenditures allocated funding for the importation of 100,000 Syrian refugees, a large number of which are straight off of the Jihadist battlefield. A full-blown Muslim invasion is underway while a criminal, runaway federal government gobbles up what remains of liberty at breathtaking speed. CONCLUSION Amazingly, while being oblivious to the aforementioned circumstances plaguing our nation, a substantial number of low information citizens are easily whipped into a frenzy by the mythological enemy of \u201cracism.\u201d Sadly, it never occurs to the reactionary mob that they in fact, are guilty of the grievous sin of rejection of truth. Yet, just as Jesus was able to miraculously give sight to the blind, God is still in the business of peeling the scales off of men\u2019s eyes. Yes, he gives grace to the humble but resisteth the proud. (James 4:6.) Concerning the hostility emanating from various directions I would say the following: We believe in Libertarian principles of free speech and freedom of association. All are free to go where they desire as well as refrain from going where they do not want to be. Of course, these same individuals will continue to patronize all manner of franchises and national chains that truly are the embodiment of corruption and exploitation. Yet another example of hypocrisy and double-standards. Will the Rick Tyler for Congress campaign gain traction and become a force to be reckoned with? Only time will tell. When all is said and done however, the truth will prevail. Of that we can be assured.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":7654}
{"claim_id":"3381","hypothesis":"Legionnaires\u2019 cases may be linked to Chicago-area hospital.","explanation_1":"State health officials are investigating whether three cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease are linked to a suburban Chicago hospital.","premise":"The Illinois Department of Public Health said Friday the three people were all patients at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Chicago. One person was an inpatient, while the other two had outpatient visits. IDPH said the three patients also had other possible sources of exposure in the 10 days before their symptoms began, so the hospital may not be the source. The department says it\u2019s working with the hospital to further investigate the cases and will be conducting more tests of facility\u2019s water. IDPH says the hospital is providing information to patents and employees who may have been affected. Most healthy people don\u2019t get Legionnaires\u2019 disease after being exposed to Legionella bacteria, which occurs naturally in the environment.

{"claim_id":"8887","hypothesis":"US FDA Says Contaminant in Some Baxter Heparin.","explanation_1":"U.S. regulators on Wednesday said they identified a contaminant in the key ingredient in Baxter International\u2019s (BAX.N) recalled blood thinning drug heparin amid 15 more reports of deaths in patients treated with some version of the drug.","premise":"The contaminant, a large complex molecule chemically similar to heparin, was detected in samples from a Chinese and a U.S. plant, both owned by Baxter\u2019s supplier, Wisconsin-based Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC (SPL). \u201cAt this point we don\u2019t know how the heparin-like compound got into the active pharmaceutical ingredient,\u201d Food and Drug Administration Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock told reporters on a conference call. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have a direct causal link between the contaminant and the adverse events.\u201d    Heparin is derived from pig intestines and is used in dialysis and heart procedures, among other surgeries, to avoid blood clots. About 200,000 doses are given a day in the U.S., according to Baxter, which supplied about half of that before its recall of virtually all its heparin products last week. The FDA said 19 deaths have been reported in patients taking a version of heparin that appears related to the drug, though it is unknown if all of those patients were on Baxter\u2019s heparin or another company\u2019s product. Some of the deaths date back to January 2007. The other major U.S. heparin supplier, APP Pharmaceuticals Inc APPX.O, ramped up production to avoid a drug shortage. Tests on APP\u2019s heparin have not turned up any contamination, Woodcock said. Both FDA and Baxter officials said it is unclear whether the contaminant was added intentionally or if it occurred as part of a natural biological process. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know whether this inadvertently got into the supply or whether it was actually added\u201d deliberately, Woodcock said. Baxter officials said they believe only four deaths have been definitely linked with their product. It has received about 500 reports of severe reactions, compared to FDA\u2019s 785 reports, which the agency said it has not fully reviewed yet. \u201cWe are having information emerge literally every hour almost on this situation,\u201d Woodcock said. The FDA\u2019s foreign inspection process has been criticized for years as inadequate and those complaints were stoked when FDA officials acknowledged recently the agency never inspected the Chinese plant in question because of confusion over the company\u2019s Chinese name. The agency inspects about 7 percent of foreign manufacturing facilities annually, according to the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency. Woodcock and Baxter both cautioned that increased attention to the problem has led to an influx of side-effect reporting and that many cases may not be related to the drug. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company gets a small portion of its revenue from heparin, which is available in generic form and has been on the market for decades. Baxter estimated recent annual sales of its Heparin at about $30 million. Baxter had total sales of $3 billion in the fourth quarter. Most of the world\u2019s crude heparin comes from China, which has become a major supplier of raw ingredients to pharmaceutical companies. All the raw material for Baxter\u2019s product came from China as well. Baxter released a chart showing the product\u2019s development cycle from pig farms, to slaughterhouses, to consolidators, to the Chinese and U.S. manufacturing plants under review. The product is finalized at Baxter\u2019s Cherry Hill, New Jersey facility. Last week, the FDA said it found \u201cobjectionable conditions\u201d at the Chinese plant that supplied the raw ingredient. Facility owner Scientific Protein Labs in a statement said the contaminant theory is \u201cspeculation at this point\u201d and that it is working with the FDA to determine the cause of the problems. Baxter said SPL is responsible for tracking the supply chain down to the farms where the pigs are raised. \u201cThey\u2019ve told us they can trace to the pig level,\u201d a Baxter official said. Severe reactions such as anaphylaxis and low blood pressure are signs of dangerous allergic reactions related to heparin use. Baxter has ruled out its Cherry Hill facility as a source of the problem.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":7107}
{"claim_id":"4793","hypothesis":"Mets GM Sandy Alderson steps down after cancer returns.","explanation_1":"His voice quavering at an unexpected news conference, Sandy Alderson revealed what he had just told his team moments before.","premise":"His cancer has returned, he\u2019s taking a leave of absence \u2014 and his up-and-down tenure as New York Mets general manager is essentially over. With the team in a massive tailspin, chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon and the 70-year-old Alderson made the announcement before Tuesday night\u2019s game against Pittsburgh. \u201cWith respect to the future, I would say two things: One is, notwithstanding the good prognosis, my health is an uncertainty going forward,\u201d said Alderson, who agreed to a contract extension in December. \u201cAnd secondly, if I were to look at it on the merits, I\u2019m not sure coming back is warranted.\u201d Asked whether he would like Alderson to resume his GM duties if his health eventually allowed that, Wilpon answered the same way twice: \u201cI think his health and his family are first and foremost.\u201d Assistant general manager John Ricco and special assistants J.P. Ricciardi and Omar Minaya will run the club\u2019s baseball operations in Alderson\u2019s absence. Minaya preceded Alderson as Mets general manager, and Ricciardi was GM of the Toronto Blue Jays from 2001-09. Alderson was hired by the Mets after the 2010 season. He was diagnosed with cancer at the end of the 2015 season and had surgery, but stayed on the job. He reduced his work schedule at times but remained in a full-time role while undergoing chemotherapy treatments. \u201cOne difference between then and now is that that took place in the offseason,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cI had a surgery in the offseason, I had some chemo in the offseason. Much easier to manage that with offseason activity. I had the decision-making authority basically at that time. I will not have the decision-making authority going forward. If people want to call me, they\u2019re welcome to do so. But at the same time, I don\u2019t expect to be involved in day-to-day activity.\u201d Ricciardi, Minaya and first-year manager Mickey Callaway were all in the interview room at Citi Field when Alderson and Wilpon made the announcement. Wilpon said Alderson informed him of his decision Sunday. \u201cIt is paramount to all of us that care greatly for Sandy that he makes this a priority for him and his family,\u201d Wilpon said, later adding: \u201cThe wear and tear on Sandy, I\u2019ve seen up close and personal. I talked to him a couple times about maybe taking a leave, maybe stepping away a little bit, and I had sort of forgotten about it because so much has been going on.\u201d According to players, Alderson broke down a bit as he spoke to his teary-eyed team in the clubhouse before addressing the media. \u201cIt definitely puts life in perspective,\u201d said outfielder Brandon Nimmo, who was Alderson\u2019s first amateur draft pick in 2011. \u201cJust very somber news that we received. Our heart\u2019s broken for him. He\u2019s been through this battle before. He knows what\u2019s in store.\u201d Mets captain David Wright, sidelined by injuries for more than two years, said players stood and gave Alderson a round of applause. \u201cI think there was a lot of jaws hitting the floor,\u201d Wright recalled. \u201cI think we had a bit of an emotional talk. It wasn\u2019t long, but at the end we certainly wanted to pay him respect.\u201d Alderson said a recurrence of his cancer was detected around late April or early May and he\u2019s been receiving treatment since. \u201cI expect that the treatment will continue, expect to have surgery later this summer. My prognosis is actually good. But in the meantime, the chemotherapy, the surgery, all take their toll,\u201d Alderson said. He said the treatment affects his energy level and leads to other side effects, explaining why he hasn\u2019t been traveling on road trips lately. \u201cWhich makes it difficult to stay up with sort of the pace, the tempo of the every day,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cOperations continue, the game continues, we have a season to play. So I think in the best interests of the Mets and for my health, this is the right result. \u201cI feel badly that we\u2019ve had the season that we have had to date. I feel personally responsible for the results that we\u2019ve had,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the same time, I have confidence in our manager, our coaching staff, our players, that this will change. John, Omar, J.P., I\u2019m sure will take a hard look at where we are, maybe take a fresh look at where we are and I have every confidence that they will serve the franchise well over the next few months through the end of the season.\u201d Alderson\u2019s departure comes at a pivotal time for the Mets ahead of the July 31 trade deadline. Needing an infusion of young talent, they will likely look to sell off pending free agents such as closer Jeurys Familia, second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera and outfielder Jose Bautista. But ace pitchers Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard could command a huge return, and the front office must decide whether to embark on such a significant overhaul. New York reached the 2015 World Series after rebuilding under Alderson and made it back to the playoffs the following year, but injuries and underperformance have decimated the team since. After going 70-92 last year, the Mets replaced manager Terry Collins with Callaway and spent nearly $90 million to fill holes in free agency. They jumped out to an 11-1 start this season, but a 6-24 slide left them 31-45 with the fewest wins in the National League going into Tuesday night\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly difficult,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really disappointed with where we are and disappointed to have left Mets fans basically in this situation. I\u2019ve said many times, you really do this to make other people happy. And when you\u2019re not making people happy, it\u2019s difficult.\u201d As the team has plummeted, Alderson has drawn more and more criticism. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be there for Sandy as much as Sandy\u2019s been there for us. A lot of times he has taken the heat on our behalf,\u201d Wright said. Alderson, a Marine Infantry Officer who served in Vietnam, is a Harvard Law School graduate. Before joining the Mets, he worked in the commissioner\u2019s office and had success running the Oakland Athletics and San Diego Padres. \u201cDifficult day for me, but I appreciate everybody being here, appreciate the support that everyone has provided me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking forward to the Mets getting back on track.\u201d ___ AP freelancer Jerry Beach contributed to this report. ___ More AP baseball: https:\/\/apnews.com\/tag\/MLBbaseball","label":0,"__index_level_0__":8232}
{"claim_id":"4518","hypothesis":"Costs forcing some hospitals to stop delivering babies.","explanation_1":"Last month\u2019s closing of the obstetrics unit at the Marshalltown hospital was only the most recent in Iowa\u2019s rural communities, which has forced some expectant mothers to skimp on prenatal care and undergo frantic trips when labor commences.","premise":"Since 2000, 34 of Iowa\u2019s 118 community hospitals have closed their birthing units, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. There have been two so far this year, down from eight closures last year \u2014 the most in a single year. Most of those closures have happened at smaller facilities than the 49-bed Marshalltown hospital. Iowa\u2019s aging population is a key reason for these closures, Dr. Stephen Hunter, vice chairman of obstetrics at the University of Iowa Hospital & Clinics in Iowa City, told Iowa Public Radio . \u201cSome rural counties have lost as many as 40 percent of their population in the last three decades,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people gone, unfortunately. That leaves a system that\u2019s not adequate for those that remain in those counties.\u201d Hunter said the state is also facing a severe shortage of OB\/GYNs and family practice doctors who practice obstetrics. And, he said, Medicaid reimbursements are so low for obstetrics that hospitals can\u2019t support the service. According to figures from the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics, Medicaid reimbursed it about one-third of what commercial insurance plans did for services such as ultrasounds and deliveries last year. Competition from bigger hospitals in bigger cities presents a business challenge, too. \u201cThere simply aren\u2019t enough women choosing to deliver locally,\u201d UnityPoint Health President Jenni Friedly said. \u201cThis is a problem that has been going on for a long time. . There are enough women becoming pregnant, but they are going elsewhere to deliver. It\u2019s clear OB\/GYN patients are already selecting Ames and Des Moines for their care.\u201d Stephanie Trusty, a nurse who tracks birthing trends for the state, told the Marshalltown Times-Republican that \u201csome of these birthing units are beautiful. They\u2019re like a four-star hotel.\u201d But does the loss of birthing units at the smaller hospitals and consolidation of birthing services affect health outcomes? A 2017 University of Minnesota study said the loss of labor and delivery units in smaller, more remote counties is linked with a decrease in prenatal care and increase in out-of-hospital and preterm births. The Iowa Public Health Department and the University of Iowa are keeping watch for any such problems, but so far have not seen any sizable incidence, Trusty said. Hansen Family Hospital CEO Doug Morse in Iowa Falls told Iowa Public Radio that hospital officials decided labor and delivery care were too expensive to continue in the aging, rural community with a declining birth rate. After three months of public meetings, Morse said, hospital officials opted to use half the money they would save to turn the unit into a mental health program for seniors. \u201cIt really did become fairly clear that people recognize that this wasn\u2019t necessarily ... delivering babies isn\u2019t necessarily a service that matches an elderly population,\u201d he said. The closing of the birth unit at the Iowa Falls hospital forced Jessica Sheridan to change her plans to have her baby born there, just five minutes from her home. She established relationships with doctors in Ames, an hour away, where her daughter was delivered in mid-December. \u201cWe were lucky. It was nice weather,\u201d Sheridan said.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":3782}

Nearly all of the price increases are below 10% and the median price increase is around 5%, according to 3 Axis. More early year price increases could still be announced. Soaring U.S. prescription drug prices are expected to again be a central issue in the presidential election. President Donald Trump, who made bringing them down a core pledge of his 2016 campaign, is running for re-election in 2020. Many branded drugmakers have pledged to keep their U.S. list price increases below 10% a year, under pressure from politicians and patients. The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world\u2019s most lucrative market for manufacturers. Drugmakers often negotiate rebates on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from healthcare payers. As a result, health insurers and patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug. Bristol-Myers said in a statement it will not raise list prices on its drugs by more than 6% this year. The drugmaker raised the price on 10 drugs on Wednesday, including 1.5% price hikes on cancer immunotherapies Opdivo and Yervoy and a 6% increase on its blood thinner Eliquis, all of which bring in billions of dollars in revenue annually. It also raised the price on Celgene\u2019s flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, 6%. Bristol acquired rival Celgene in a $74 billion deal last year. Gilead raised prices on more than 15 drugs including HIV treatments Biktarvy and Truvada less than 5%, according to 3 Axis. Biogen price increases included a 6% price hike on multiple sclerosis treatment Tecfidera, according to 3 Axis. Gilead and Biogen could not be immediately reached for comment. 3 Axis advises pharmacy industry groups on identifying  inefficiencies in the U.S. drug supply chain and has provided consulting work to hedge fund billionaire John Arnold, a prominent critic of high drug prices.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":7491}
{"claim_id":"6791","hypothesis":"Walker signs bill lifting Wisconsin mining moratorium.","explanation_1":"Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill Monday lifting Wisconsin\u2019s moratorium on gold and silver mining, reversing his vote from nearly 20 years ago imposing the ban and brushing aside conservationists\u2019 warnings that the measure will lead to devastating pollution.","premise":"The governor signed the GOP-authored bill during a mid-day stop at the Oneida County Airport in Rhinelander. The bill\u2019s supporters say lifting the moratorium will re-energize mining in northern Wisconsin and boost the region\u2019s economy. Lawmakers from both parties put the ban in place in 1998 out of concerns about sulfide mining polluting Wisconsin\u2019s waters. Walker was a member of the state Assembly at the time and voted to impose the prohibition. His spokesman, Tom Evenson, has said in recent weeks that the governor believes mining can be done without harming the environment, but he hasn\u2019t offered anything more to explain the governor\u2019s change of heart. \u201cIf there\u2019s anywhere in the world that should be able to conduct safe and environmentally sound mining, it should be the Badger State. #WIWorking,\u201d Walker tweeted Monday. He followed up with a news release in which he called mining a piece of Wisconsin\u2019s history. \u201cWith this new bill, we\u2019re paying tribute to our state\u2019s rich roots in the field and creating new family-supporting careers in the mining industry, all while protecting our abundant and valuable natural resources,\u201d Walker said. Gold, copper, zinc, nickel and other metals are typically found bonded to sulfur. Such compounds produce sulfuric acid when exposed to oxygen and water, creating the risk of runoff polluting streams and rivers. Sulfuric acid readily mixes with water and can kill fish, plants and insects as well as burn human skin, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Acidic waters also can release heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury when they pass through waste mining rock and mining tailings, according to the federation. The 1998 law requires sulfide mining applicants to prove a similar mine has operated for 10 years somewhere in North America without causing pollution. It also requires applicants to prove a similar mine has been closed in North America for a decade without causing pollution. No other state has such requirements. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has never issued a final determination that any mining applicant has satisfied the standards. The bill eliminates those requirements as well as eases sulfide mining regulations. Large-scale sampling operations will no longer need to obtain environmental impact statements. Administrative law judges wouldn\u2019t be able to block any DNR decisions on mining applications, forcing challengers into circuit court. Mining applicants also will no longer have to establish perpetual trust funds to cover environmental damage, although they would be financially responsible for any environmental damage within 40 years of the mine\u2019s closure and would have to maintain the mine\u2019s water management systems for 250 years. The measure comes as Aquila Resources Inc. is considering mining ore deposits in Taylor and Marathon counties. The company has been eyeing the deposits since 2011 but hasn\u2019t filed any formal permit applications. \u201cThe Governor joins fellow GOP legislators who embrace highly polluting and damaging mining over long-term sustainable development for central and northern Wisconsin,\u201d Dave Blouin, mining chair for the Sierra Club\u2019s Wisconsin chapter, said in a statement. \u201cThis law will not result in prosperity for northern Wisconsin and threatens the natural resources that are the foundation of sustainable jobs from tourism, agriculture and our outdoor heritage.\u201d Walker\u2019s allies praised the signing. Eric Bott, leader of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin, praised the governor for signing the bill, saying in a statement that the measure is \u201can early Christmas present to the working men and women of Northern Wisconsin.\u201d The bill marks the second significant piece of legislation designed to jump-start the mining industry in northern Wisconsin that Walker will have signed since taking office in 2011. The other bill dramatically loosened Wisconsin\u2019s iron mining regulations. The measure was designed to clear the way for Gogebic Taconite to dig a massive open-pit mine near Lake Superior. The company promised the mine would create hundreds of jobs but ultimately gave up on the project. Most bills take effect within days of the governor signing them, but Republican Rep. Jerry Petrowski amended the moratorium bill to delay its effective date for six months. Petrowski said he wanted to give local governments time to develop their own mining ordinances, saying in a letter to the Wisconsin counties and towns associations that sulfide mining carries \u201cinherent risks.\u201d ___ Follow Todd Richmond on Twitter at https:\/\/twitter.com\/trichmond1","label":0,"__index_level_0__":6789}
{"claim_id":"5578","hypothesis":"Another case of meningococcal disease at Oregon State.","explanation_1":"Oregon State University said Wednesday it will fight an outbreak of meningococcal disease by requiring students 25 and younger to be vaccinated against the disease by Feb. 15.","premise":"The university announced its decision after the Oregon Health Authority reported that an undergraduate has been diagnosed with the disease, the sixth case in an outbreak that began a little more than a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019re raising the bar, and that happens today,\u201d university spokesman Steve Clark said. The latest case is a 21-year-old student enrolled at the Corvallis campus who was hospitalized Dec. 17 with meningitis \u2014 a potentially lethal infection of the brain and spinal cord \u2014 while visiting family. Preliminary tests found meningococcal disease to be the probable cause, and additional testing will determine whether it\u2019s the same strain of meningococcal bacteria that caused the other illnesses. The first five patients all made full recoveries. Charlie Fautin, deputy director of the Benton County Health Department, said that\u2019s statistically unusual, and the disease has fatality rate of about 10 percent. Symptoms include the sudden onset of a fever, stiff neck and headache. It can also cause flu-like symptoms and nausea, vomiting and a rash. \u201cThis disease can progress from sort of feeling like you have the flu \u2014 feeling kind of cruddy \u2014 to being catastrophic very quickly,\u201d Fautin said. Health officials urged students to get vaccinated during the winter break that began Dec. 9 and continues through Jan. 7. The university held three mass vaccination clinics this fall, but attendance was not mandatory. The disease primarily afflicts young people and can spread in group living situations such as dormitories. A University of Oregon student, Lauren Jones, died during an outbreak on the Eugene campus in 2015. A doctor at the hospital near campus diagnosed her with a flu-like illness and sent her home to rest. The 18-year-old woman died later that day in her dorm room.

His testimony comes as President Donald Trump is praising states that are reopening after the prolonged lock-down aimed at controlling the virus\u2019 spread. Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task force charged with shaping the response to COVID-19, which has killed tens of thousands of people in the U.S., is testifying via video conference after self-quarantining as a White House staffer tested positive for the virus. With the U.S. economy in free-fall and more than 30 million people unemployed, Trump has been pressuring states to reopen.

Even before the gavel drops, the hearing offers two takeaways for the rest of the country, said John Auerbach, president of the nonprofit public health group Trust for America\u2019s Health. \u201cOne thing it tells you is that the virus can have an impact in any workplace setting or any community setting,\u201d said Auerbach. \u201cAll businesses will find it very challenging to ensure safety when there are cases.\u201d Another lesson is that the public officials involved are taking the virus seriously by not appearing in person. \u201cThey are following the guidelines that they are recommending to others,\u201d said Auerbach. \u201cThere is not a double standard.\u201d The main questions for the administration experts revolve around the \u201cThree T\u2019s,\u201d or testing, tracing and treatment. Without widespread testing, state and local officials will be basing decisions to reopen businesses and schools on incomplete data with blind spots lurking. Without the ability to do the painstaking work of tracing the contacts of people infected, unwitting transmission will continue. Without effective treatments, hospitals in a given community could be overwhelmed in a COVID-19 rebound. Ultimately, the goal is a vaccine that would offer widespread protection. The health committee hearing offers a very different setting from the White House coronavirus task force briefings the administration witnesses have all participated in. Senators on the panel are knowledgeable and some have working relationships that go back years with the agencies that the panelists are representing. Most significantly, President Donald Trump will not be controlling the agenda. Eyeing the November elections, Trump has been eager to restart the economy, urging on protesters who oppose their state governors\u2019 stay-at-home orders and expressing his own confidence that the coronavrius will fade away as summer advances and Americans return to work and other pursuits. The ranking Democrat on the health panel, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, doesn\u2019t think the Trump administration is doing nearly enough to keep the virus under control as the economy reopens. \u201cPresident Trump is trying to ignore the facts, and ignore the experts who have been clear we are nowhere close to where we need to be to reopen safely,\u201d she said in a statement. Murray will participate via video, but some senators are expected to attend in person. Alexander is more nuanced about the nation\u2019s readiness. He suggests there\u2019s enough testing to move to reopen the economy, but worries that there won\u2019t be enough to sustain a return to normality. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to do what we need to do today to reopen,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough, for example, when 35,000 kids and faculty show up on the University of Tennessee campus in August.\u201d With more types of tests on the market from different manufacturers and providers, testing is an area that\u2019s become particularly difficult for lay people to navigate. Until now there has been only one kind of test to detect active infection. Called a PCR test, it detects the genetic material of the virus, and is still considered the most accurate. Last weekend the FDA approved the first \u201cantigen\u201d test, which looks for protein traces of the virus instead, much like rapid tests for flu or strep throat. Antigen tests aren\u2019t as accurate as PCR tests but promise to be faster and easier to use. A third kind of test detects past infection, by spotting antibodies in people\u2019s blood. But it\u2019s not yet clear if having those antibodies means someone is immune from another bout of COVID-19.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":1473}
{"claim_id":"6495","hypothesis":"Fresh grounds for coffee: Study shows it may boost longevity.","explanation_1":"Go ahead and have that cup of coffee, maybe even several more. New research shows it may boost chances for a longer life, even for those who down at least eight cups daily.","premise":"In a study of nearly half-a-million British adults, coffee drinkers had a slightly lower risk of death over 10 years than abstainers. The apparent longevity boost was seen with instant, ground and decaffeinated, results that echo U.S. research. It\u2019s the first large study to suggest a benefit even in people with genetic glitches affecting how their bodies use caffeine. Overall, coffee drinkers were about 10 percent to 15 percent less likely to die than abstainers during a decade of follow-up. Differences by amount of coffee consumed and genetic variations were minimal. The results don\u2019t prove your coffee pot is a fountain of youth nor are they a reason for abstainers to start drinking coffee, said Alice Lichtenstein, a Tufts University nutrition expert who was not involved in the research. But she said the results reinforce previous research and add additional reassurance for coffee drinkers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that something we enjoy so much could be good for us. Or at least not be bad,\u201d Lichtenstein said. The study was published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. It\u2019s not clear exactly how drinking coffee might affect longevity. Lead author Erikka Loftfield, a researcher at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, said coffee contains more than 1,000 chemical compounds including antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage. Other studies have suggested that substances in coffee may reduce inflammation and improve how the body uses insulin, which can reduce chances for developing diabetes. Loftfield said efforts to explain the potential longevity benefit are continuing. Adam Taylor, fetching two iced coffees for friends Monday in downtown Chicago, said the study results make sense. \u201cCoffee makes you happy, it gives you something to look forward to in the morning,\u201d said Taylor, a sound engineer from Las Vegas. \u201cI try to have just one cup daily,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cOtherwise I get a little hyper.\u201d For the study, researchers invited 9 million British adults to take part; 498,134 women and men aged 40 to 69 agreed. The low participation rate means those involved may have been healthier than the general U.K. population, the researchers said. Participants filled out questionnaires about daily coffee consumption, exercise and other habits, and received physical exams including blood tests. Most were coffee drinkers; 154,000 or almost one-third drank two to three cups daily and 10,000 drank at least eight cups daily. During the next decade, 14,225 participants died, mostly of cancer or heart disease. Caffeine can cause short-term increases in blood pressure, and some smaller studies have suggested that it might be linked with high blood pressure, especially in people with a genetic variation that causes them to metabolize caffeine slowly. But coffee drinkers in the U.K. study didn\u2019t have higher risks than nondrinkers of dying from heart disease and other blood pressure-related causes. And when all causes of death were combined, even slow caffeine metabolizers had a longevity boost. As in previous studies, coffee drinkers were more likely than abstainers to drink alcohol and smoke, but the researchers took those factors into account, and coffee drinking seemed to cancel them out. The research didn\u2019t include whether participants drank coffee black or with cream and sugar. But Lichtenstein said loading coffee with extra fat and calories isn\u2019t healthy. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter: @LindseyTanner . ____ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

{"claim_id":"34437","hypothesis":"The simultaneous death of infant twins in Turkey in 2002 was connected to their having recently received vaccinations.","explanation_1":"Thailand opened its first full-time clinic specializing in traditional and alternative cannabis-based medicine on Monday, as part of a move by the government towards developing a medicinal cannabis industry.","premise":"\u201cThis is a pilot clinic, because we cannot produce enough doctors with expertise in cannabis,\u201d Public Health Minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, told reporters at the opening ceremony in Bangkok. Patients will receive treatment free of charge for the first two weeks, he added. Thailand, which has a tradition of using cannabis to relieve pain and fatigue, legalized marijuana for medical use and research in 2017 to boost agricultural income. There are already around 25 cannabis clinics attached to general hospitals around the country but, unlike the newly-launched pilot clinic, they operate for just a few days a week due to a lack of specialized staff. The largest producer of medicinal cannabis is currently the health ministry\u2019s Government Pharmaceutical Organization. Kasetsart University\u2019s director of medical cannabis research, Natakorn Thasnas, told Reuters that the university would supply  2,200 kilograms of cannabis leaf to the ministry. Cannabis production, cultivation and sale has been limited to licensed Thai producers for the next four years to protect the domestic industry. Currently, only hospitals and research facilities are allowed to apply for cannabis production and extraction licenses, but the government is reviewing regulations to enable Thai businesses to apply for permits. Last year, Thailand dropped cannabis and hemp extracts from its narcotics list and proposed a draft law that would allow each household to grow six cannabis plants. Four types of drugs, containing different combinations of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psycho-active ingredient in cannabis, were given to patients to treat migraine, insomnia, neck pain and muscle stiffness, the ministry said in a statement. The pilot clinic, based in the Ministry of Public Health, expects to see between 200 to 300 patients daily. \u201cI was worried at first, but I studied the effects and decided it was better because its natural,\u201d said Waraporn Boonsri, 69, who received four vials of cannabis oil to help her sleep. Nearly 2,200 patients have registered at the clinic until March, a health official told Reuters. Anutin said there were plans for 77 clinics to be opened across the country, with one in every province.

{"claim_id":"34708","hypothesis":"Bride-to-be sends over-the-top list of instructions to her attendants.","explanation_1":"Those who\u2019ve yet to have their fill of bridezilla stories will find many, many more stashed in the archives of Etiquette Hell, your one-stop shop for horrifying accounts of people behaving badly.","premise":"We began seeing this intriguing letter in our inbox in February 2002, when countless readers began forwarding it to us to ask if it was the real thing. Was this yet another glimpse into the machinations of a \u201cbridezilla,\u201d a gal so caught up in the plans for her wedding that she turns into a monster? Or was it something else? Example: [Dear Abby, 2003] MEMO TO MY ATTENDANTS: Hey, girls! Mom has your dresses for the wedding. She\u2019ll bring them to the shower next weekend. You can pick them up there. Allison sent me an e-mail asking what style shoes and jewelry to wear. Great question, Allison! There are so many details. I keep forgetting to tell my girls what to do.This is an excellent opportunity to go over my expectations for each of you: About the shoes, please wear tasteful flats. Most of you are taller than me. I\u2019d rather you not all tower over me. I want all of you to wear your hair down. Since Babs and Allison have similar hair, I\u2019d prefer that Babs straighten hers and let Allison be the curly-haired girl. After all, she\u2019s my friend and you are just bridesmaids! I\u2019m sure you understand. Judy and Molly, you have both mentioned that you intend to shed a few pounds. This would be the perfect time! Watch your diets; we will all start weekly weigh-ins. Allison could use some trimming down, too. Also, you should all stay away from alcohol for at least a week before the wedding. None of us should be puffy or bloated. I think this is mainly for Babs, as none of my ladies drink all that much. Other than that, I don\u2019t have any real suggestions. Oh, please don\u2019t go tanning! I prefer to blend in with you than stand out as the pale one! Judy, Allison and Molly, please call me. There are a few other things that I need to go over with you on this topic. Babs, you are Scotty\u2019s friend, so I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell you what needs to be corrected \u2014 plus, your own wedding is coming up after mine. So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already more than a little aware of what you need to work on. See y\u2019all on Saturday. Babs, remember you\u2019ll attend the shower with us girls rather than the paintball fun with the boys. Dress accordingly, dear! Bridezilla tales are nothing new to the Internet, and usually after blossoming briefly to horrify the masses, they quietly fade into obscurity. This one, however, gained a shot in the arm when it appeared in a Dear Abby column in September 2002. Readers sent the much-traveled e-mail to Abby, seeking her comments. She offered no opinion on whether the story was true but replied: If the document you sent me is on the level, the bride-to-be appears to have an abundance of unresolved control issues and an astounding lack of tact. Abby\u2019s observation was dead on. It also brings us back to the \u201cwas this for real or not?\u201d element of the tale. You see, if this had been a hoax, it would have been designed to make its purported author look especially heinous. And there\u2019s a strong chance that\u2019s exactly what happened. A couple of small sections of the earlier e-mail were left out of the Dear Abby version, namely: [Following \u201cMost of you are taller than me, so would rather you all not tower over me\u2019] Plus, many of you are unaware, but Addie is terribly ill and sometimes is paralyzed from the waist down. And we do want to take care of Adam\u2019s girl! [Following \u201cLindsay could use some trimming up too\u201d] Addie, you just take care of yourself. I know that some of us have trouble with food and I don\u2019t want to encourage any bad habits with those who have had problems in the past. (In the February 2002 original, all the participants had different names: The curly-haired friend was Lindsay instead of Allison; Leisha and Sissy were the gals who needed to lose weight, not Judy and Molly; Addie, instead of Babs, was the paintball-loving two-fisted drinker who was soon to marry the problematic Adam, not Scotty; and the now-nameless bride signed herself as Jenny.) A careful reading of the original reveals little digs are made at Addie (Babs) throughout the piece. Granted, brides do not always get along famously with their bridesmaids, but this level of barely suppressed hostility is unusual. The unrelenting Addie-bashing should sound a few distant warning bells in those tempted to take the letter at face value, because the behavior doesn\u2019t fit the occasion. Addie drinks too much, has \u201cfood problems,\u201d is marrying a loser, is dead from the waist down, should have her hair straightened because another bridesmaid preferred by the bride also has curly hair, and has to be reminded to dress properly for the shower on Saturday to head off her turning up in shorts and a dirty T-shirt. The letter wasn\u2019t so much an \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding and here\u2019s how I want to run it\u201d missive as it was a bashing of one girl. Some mailings identified the bridezilla in question, so we asked her about it. She replied that while she\u2019d been made the goat of this affair, she hadn\u2019t written the letter; the piece had been the work of a disgruntled ex-boyfriend of Addie\u2019s. This fellow had somehow gained access to Addie\u2019s e-mail account, fabricated a letter supposedly written by the bride, and propagated it as if it were something Addie had received and was now forwarding to others. In this way, everyone in Addie\u2019s address book got to see all the little digs at her. Is this a reasonable scenario? In an oddball way it is \u2014 it certainly better explains the \u201cAddie bashing\u201d element of the letter than does the \u201cbitchy bride\u201d construct. Bridezillas are generally far too lost in what\u2019s going on with them to spare much attention for any member of the wedding party other than themselves. A true bridezilla would barely recognize that her bridesmaids had lives outside of the wedding, let alone be capable of diverting the focus of attention from herself to any of them. Jenny\u2019s explanation may be plausible, but since we can\u2019t prove the story one way or the other, we\u2019ll leave this one marked as \u201cUndetermined.\u201d The letter in question appeared in the May 2002 issue of Cosmopolitan as a sidebar to a larger article about bridezillas. All the names were changed once again. The current bridezilla tale echoes an older e-mail similarly transmitted across the Internet in 1999. Please note that the claims of this letter\u2019s having been penned in all seriousness by a real bride have not been substantiated, but the piece did run in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1991. Harper\u2019s presented it as: \u201cFrom a letter sent by a Youngstown, Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers in 1976. Since then, copies of the six-page, single-spaced letter have been circulating nationally among engaged and newlywed couples.\u201d EDITORS NOTE: This is an actual 1976 letter from a Youngstown,Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers. Read it and count your blessings. (FROM HARPER\u2019S MAGAZINE)Dear Bridal Party: From time to time I will be dropping everyone a line or two to keep each of you informed about how the wedding plans are progressing so that no one thinks I have forgotten them and no one is in the dark. Bridesmaids: Each bridesmaid will receive her dress via mail from Priscilla of Boston sometime in January. This will give each of you enough time to have the dress \u201cprofessionally\u201d altered if need be. The dresses are chiffon \u201cPriscilla\u201d dresses and can be worn after the wedding. The right shoulder is bare and there is no sleeve on the left arm. Each has its own cape, which goes almost to the floor. The two matrons of honor will be in silver and the four bridesmaids in peppermint green. As of this date, I have not decided whether the two in silver will wear green gloves and the four in green silver gloves, but long gloves will be worn. I strongly suggest that each person shops now for the typical cloth \u201cclosed-toe\u201d shoe. Keep the heel size reasonable \u2013 of course, no platforms of any kind. Anyone having trouble with their legs should wear support hose. Ushers: Each usher will be dressed identically to the groom, best man, and the head groomsman: black tails. Be sure you have black silk socks and black dress shoes polished to a high shine. Reception Rehearsal: On Saturday afternoon (early) we will go to Powers Auditorium to practice for the reception that night after the wedding ceremony. Why? Well, there is a long staircase at the auditorium that will be put to full use: Each bridal-party couple will be introduced separately and will proceed down the first half of the staircase (accompanied by music). Upon reaching the platform in the middle of the stairs, the girl will be required to \u201cswirl\u201d from the right side of the steps and move to the left side, and her partner (an usher) will move to the right; then they will proceed down the second half of the stairs and take their positions for the Bridal Dance. Dancing: I will try to find a choreographer to help with the Bridal Dance \u2014 but each person can please do his or her part by learning to waltz correctly in three-quarter time. Now, when I say waltz, I do not in any way mean two steps here and two steps there, always standing in one spot. When we waltz it will be to \u201cTales of the Vienna Woods.\u201d Each usher will be twirling his partner while moving in a large circle and maintaining even spacing between each couple. Turn on some old-time movies and you can see how it is supposed to be done. But, PLEASE, PLEASE, practice now! Suggestion: Go take dancing lessons!! That\u2019s what we have to do!! Also, there will be some polkas, the Charleston, jitterbug, and others. These are not \u201crequired\u201d dances. There will not be any up-to-date dances. I personally dislike them and think they look terrible-they simply are not dances, in my estimation. Photographs: There will be plenty. First and foremost, there will be \u201csound motion pictures\u201d taken throughout the wedding ceremony, during the Bridal Dance, and while each bridal-party couple walks down the steps at the reception. Flash pictures will be taken in the church ONLY until my father and I arrive at the altar-after that there will be NO flash pictures; the official photographer will be taking time exposures. I believe it is the height of ill manners for any guest to leave his or her seat and proceed to the altar to take pictures. Dress Requirements: Makeup \u2014 It is requested that you wear a little more than usual because of the photographs and the movie pictures. Any ladies with short eyelashes are requested to wear either false eyelashes or go to a beauty parlor and have false eyelashes put in one by one. The matrons of honor wearing the silver dresses must have a lot of pink in their makeup. That is straight from Priscilla. Be sure that each of the four other bridesmaids has green eyeshadow and that every one wears blusher, powder, eyebrow pencil, foundation, lipstick, and mascara \u2014 the works!! There will be two experts in the field of makeup to help anyone who needs it or wants it. As for the men, ho, ho, you will have your turn also. If you have a shiny face, be sure to use some of your wife\u2019s face powder to take the shine away. For the wives and husbands of those who are in the wedding party: Ladies-the color of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses has been stated, and all that I ask is that your dress be a color that will not contrast with the peppermint green, that it is of full length, and fairly simple in line. Also, please do not wear an extensive amount of jewelry, as the bridesmaids will possibly wear only small pearl earrings. Be sure each of you has gloves. You need wear nothing in your hair. Men \u2014 Amy Vanderbilt\u2019s book on etiquette says that anyone receiving a formal invitation is to wear \u201cblack tie,\u201d which means tuxedo. Now, this could get rather touchy, so I will put it this way: If you do not wish to wear a tux, or do not wish to take on the expense of renting one, it will be perfectly fine to wear a \u201cblack\u201d suit, white shirt with French cuffs, black silk socks, black shoes, and a black-and-silver tie. I hope this doesn\u2019t inconvenience too many, but I would hate to look at color pictures of the head table and see some men in black tails and others in brown or blue suits!! Children at the Wedding or Reception: It is my wish, and also Z.\u2019s [the fianc\u00e9], that there be no children at the wedding ceremony or at the reception. For purposes of clarification, a child is anyone eighteen years or younger. There are many reasons for this request, but the best is the simple fact that I don\u2019t have the money to invite children who only pick at their food, cry, run around, etc. One friend of mine, who married about a year ago, says that when she got her wedding pictures back, there wasn\u2019t one that didn\u2019t have a kid in it and she was disgusted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, children are great. But there is a time and a place for them and this isn\u2019t it. This is an adult, ultra-formal affair and I want to keep it that way. One point of etiquette: When a formal invitation is sent out with Mr. and Mrs. Paul J. Smith on the outside envelope and Mr. and Mrs. Smith on the inside envelope, that is exactly what it means \u2014 only Mr. and Mrs. Smith are being invited and no one else; no others in the family, no guests who might be visiting at the time, etc. If asked about guests, you can \u201cdiplomatically\u201d pass this on. I know it sounds like I am being a real fusspot, but I would hate to tell each of you what the cost is per person just for the reception alone. I\u2019m doing this for my friends and relatives, for all of us to have a good time, but since there are only so many hours in the day, and I already have three jobs, and I am not a Vanderbilt, some lines must be drawn, and I hope everyone understands. I\u2019ve never wanted a small country-type wedding \u2014 Z. says this is no wedding but rather a coronation!! Well, not quite. But it sure has been fun so far, and I just cannot wait for everyone to arrive and for all our friends and relatives to have one great, fabulous night. Everyone think positive and keep your fingers crossed. Pray \u2014 that will bring more help. Won\u2019t each of you come with Z. and me to fantasyland \u2014 a place where dreams come true and fun abounds for everyone? Where the bride is Cinderella and the groom is Cinderfella for an evening. You are going to attend a ball at \u201cBuckingham Palace\u201d (pretend) and the King and Queen have invited only \u201croyalty\u201d \u2014 YOU! This will be a time to remember when you were courting the person to whom you are now married-a time to take a second honeymoon. We want everyone to be as happy as we are and to rekindle (add extra \u201cfire\u201d to) their own marriages. If you have a happy marriage now (which I know you all do), we expect the Palace to be really electrified with all that LOVE. May your every dream come true!","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4864}
{"claim_id":"34436","hypothesis":"A blow to the testicles can kill a man.","explanation_1":"While there have been cases in both the media and the scientific literature that report a connection between testicular trauma and fatalities, these case reports are speculative, sparse, and do not provide enough information to confidently demonstrate the mechanisms hypothesized behind them. A kick in the balls may lead to serious complications, but most urologists agree that death is not one of them.","premise":"Kicking, punching, or squeezing testicles has long been prized as an effective means to briefly incapacitate men, as it brings about a powerful full-body pain. The reasons for such a blow\u2019s power stems from the lack of protection the testes receive from the scrotum, the high concentration of pain receptors called nociceptors surrounding them, and the myriad interconnections between testicular nerves and organs throughout your body. The pain, medically called\u00a0\u201cblunt scrotal trauma,\u201d typically subsides without incident. However, more serious complications can arise with enough force. Have such injuries resulted in death? Potentially, though most agree that other exacerbating factors have to be considered in addition to the testicular trauma. Perhaps one the earliest purported cases of death resulting from injury to the testicle was found in a brief but terrifying case report\u00a0from 1843,\u00a0which reads: In some parts of Germany a barbarous custom exists, in cases of quarrel, of violently compressing the testicles. M. Schlesier, of Peitz, relates a case of sudden death from this species of injury. The patient fell to the ground, was seized with violent convulsions, and died in a few minutes. Without further information, it is impossible to say what exactly happened in that specific incident. The reported heart attack suffered by thirteen-year-old boy whose testicles were squeezed as part of a schoolyard prank in 2014, however, may be illustrative of how (under rare and specific extenuating circumstances) stress from that kind of trauma could result in an immediate reaction similar to the 19th-century German account. Speaking to Vice News about the\u00a02014 incident, Dr. Marc Bjurlin, a clinical instructor in Urologic Oncology at New York University, said that he can \u201conly speculate\u201d that the teenager had a hidden condition: \u201cIf that\u2019s true in the case, I suspect the boy had an underlying etiology and that the scrotal injury, perhaps from the pain, resulted in a vasovagal response which may have lowered his blood pressure and exacerbated a cardiac etiology,\u201d Bjurlin said. The sheer pain response from having one\u2019s testicles yanked is more than enough to exacerbate any number of underlying conditions, he said. A 2008\u00a0case report of a different thirteen-year-old who had been kicked in the groin during a football game\u00a0describes how he came down with a life-threatening, infection-mimicking condition called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) after the trauma. This case report concluded that death from testicular trauma is a possibility that must be considered: In our case, the patient initially presented with a minor scrotal injury; swelling and pain without ecchymosis were the only symptoms. Then, without evidence of infection, he gradually progressed to a life-threatening condition, unresponsive to empiric antibiotics and standard fluid resuscitation. Now recovered, the patient continues to be monitored for any long-term consequences of his injury. Initially patients with acute scrotal pain are told to look for signs of injury and infection, but they should also be aware of the signs of sepsis and SIRS. Although rare, death is no longer beyond the realm of consequences from testicular injury and physicians must be prepared to deliver appropriate care. SIRS was, additionally, blamed for the death of an eighteen-year-old male in India who injured himself riding a bicycle: Few cases of acute scrotal pain might lead to Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which is a life threatening condition. We report a case of an 18 year old boy who sustained testicular trauma while riding a bicycle and two months post trauma developed severe pain in left inguino-scrotal region, fever and subsequently died. The authors intend to report this unusual case as cases of testicular trauma resulting in shock and SIRS have been reported in literature but were unable to find cases of death occurring due to SIRS. Outside these rare (and still somewhat ill-defined) examples, the most plausible complications from testicular trauma are generally not life-threatening, though some (most notably trauma-induced testicular torsion) can lead to a loss of fertility or even the removal of a testicle if not properly treated. A 2004 consensus paper in BJU International outlined the potential injuries as a result of testicular trauma: Blunt trauma may cause local haematoma, ecchymosis of the scrotum, or injuries to the testicle, epididymis or spermatic cord. In testicular rupture the tunica albuginea is disrupted, while in intratesticular haematoma the tunica albuginea remains intact. Haematoceles, in which blood accumulates in the space between the tunica albuginea and tunica vaginalis, and hydroceles, can be the result of trauma. Traumatically induced testicular torsion is another well recognized entity.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":5071}

The story, titled \u201cWas Bra-ced for a Different Reaction,\u201d reported that a female student (identified only as \u201cdaughter\u201d) was about to be punished for hitting a male student (identified only as \u201cboy\u201d) before her mother stepped in and explained to the teacher that the school should be punishing \u201cboy\u201d instead of \u201cdaughter\u201d since \u201cboy\u201d was the one who had sexually assaulted \u201cdaughter\u201d when he snapped her bra:  (I\u2019m an A&E nurse. We\u2019re not allowed [to keep] our phones on us; they\u2019re to be kept in our lockers. A call comes into hospital reception on a private line for me.) Phone: \u201cThis is [Teacher] from [School]. There\u2019s been an incident involving [Daughter]. We need you to come in.\u201d Me: \u201cIs she ill or injured? Can it wait until my shift is over in two hours?\u201d Phone: \u201c[Daughter] has struck another pupil. We\u2019ve been trying to call you for 45 minutes. It really is very serious.\u201d (I go to the school and am ushered into the head\u2019s office. I see my daughter, her head of year, a male teacher, the headmaster, a boy with blood around his nose and a red face, and his parents.) Head: \u201cMrs. [My Name], how kind of you to FINALLY join us!\u201d Me: \u201cYeah, things get busy in A&E. I\u2019ve spent the last hour administering over 40 stitches to a seven-year-old who was beaten by his mother with a metal ladle and then I had to deal with the police regarding the matter. Sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d (After watching him try to not act embarrassed, he tells me what has happened. The boy had twanged my daughter\u2019s bra and she had punched him in the face twice. I got the impression they were more angry with my daughter than the boy.) The details of the above-quoted story are impossible to verify since all names and locations have been redacted. Without this information we have to rely on the source, the content of the article, and basic intuition. While Not Always Learning publishes user-submitted stories that \u201care based on actual, real events,\u201d the FAQ section explains that some stories are changed from second-hand tales to first-person accounts for dramatic effect:  Sometimes we will need to edit a story slightly to make it suitable for publication. Scene-setting is great, but extraneous detail may need to be cut down a little. Your submission might explain that this didn\u2019t happen to you but to your classmate\/colleague\/friend, but the audience doesn\u2019t need to know that. Don\u2019t worry, we still aim to keep the spirit of the story alive and ensure it remains as hilarious as ever! The stories published on Not Always Learning are user-submitted anecdotes meant to entertain readers. While the editors supposedly endeavor to ensure stories are based on real events, an amusing story clearly takes precedence over a factual one. Which brings us back to the content of \u201cWas Bra-ced for a Different Reaction.\u201d The story is filled with unnecessary detail to make the mother character the only credible voice; for instance, the story gives plenty of detail about the mother\u2019s heroic work in the A&E (accident and emergency room), while the other characters are painted as ignorant and incompetent:  Me: \u201cOh. And you want to know if I\u2019m going to press charges against him for sexually assaulting my daughter and against the school for allowing him to do it?\u201d (They all get jittery when I mention sexual assault and start speaking at once.) Teacher: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was that serious.\u201d Head Of Year: \u201cLet\u2019s not over-react.\u201d Head: \u201cI think you\u2019re missing the point.\u201d (The boy\u2019s mother then starts crying. I turn to my daughter to find out what happened.) Daughter: \u201cHe kept pinging my bra. I asked him to stop but he didn\u2019t, so I told Mr. [Teacher]. He told me to \u2018ignore it.\u2019 [Boy] did it again and undid my bra so I hit him. Then he stopped.\u201d (I turn to the teacher.) Me: \u201cYou let him do this? Why didn\u2019t you stop him? Come over here and let me touch the front of your trousers.\u201d Teacher: \u201cWhat?! No!\u201d Me: \u201cDoes that seem inappropriate to you? Why don\u2019t you go and pull on Mrs. [Head Of Year]\u2019s bra right now. See how fun it is for her. Or on that boy\u2019s mum\u2019s bra. Or mine. You think just because they\u2019re kids it\u2019s fun?\u201d  The mother\u2019s quick retorts also seem implausible. The story depicts a very frustrating situation, yet the mother manages to find the perfect words at every turn. While this is possible, it seems more likely that the story was written after the incident as the writer recalled exactly what she should have said. There\u2019s no English word for this concept: the French use the term \u201cesprit de l\u2019escalier,\u201d the Germans know it as treppenwitz, and fans of Seinfeld call it the Jerk Store Paradox. The story concludes with a final speech about sexual assault from this enraged mother as she scolds the teacher and the headmaster, threatens \u201cboy,\u201d and takes \u201cdaughter\u201d out of the office:  Head: \u201cMrs. [My Name]. With all due respect, [Daughter] still beat another child.\u201d Me: \u201cNo. She defended herself against a sexual attack from another pupil. Look at them; he\u2019s nearly 6 feet and 11 or 12 stone. She\u2019s 5 feet and 6 stone. He\u2019s a foot taller than her and twice as heavy. How many times should she have let him touch her? If the person who was supposed to help and protect her in a classroom couldn\u2019t be bothered what should she have done? He pulled her bra so hard it came undone.\u201d (The boy\u2019s mum is still crying and his dad looks both angry and embarrassed. The teacher won\u2019t make eye contact with me. I look at the headmaster.) Me: \u201cI\u2019m taking her home. I think the boy has learnt his lesson. And I hope nothing like this ever happens again, not only to [Daughter], but to any other girl at this school. You wouldn\u2019t let him do it to a member of staff so what makes you think he can do it to a girl of 15 is beyond me. I will be reporting this to the governors. And if you\u2013\u201d *turning to the boy* \u201c\u2013EVER touch my daughter again I WILL have you arrested for sexual assault. Do you understand me?\u201d (I was so angry I gathered my daughter\u2019s things and left. I reported it to the Board of Governors, several of whom I know from Church (it\u2019s a Catholic school), and was assured it would be strongly dealt with. I also reported it to OFSTED (Government-run school monitoring) and they were equally as horrified and assured me they would contact the school. My daughter was put into a different class for that subject, away from the teacher and the boy.)","label":1,"__index_level_0__":7162}
{"claim_id":"41850","hypothesis":"\u201cI was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.\u201d","explanation_1":"In a recent press conference, President Donald Trump defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from allegations of sexual misconduct and made claims about some of Trump\u2019s own accusers that were false or lacked evidence.","premise":"In a recent press conference, President Donald Trump defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from allegations of sexual misconduct and made claims about some of Trump\u2019s own accusers that were false or lacked evidence.Trump made those claims in a press conference in New York on Sept. 26. He said his opinions of the allegations against Kavanaugh have been shaped by personal experience. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve had a lot of false charges made against me,\u201d Trump said.Trump claimed that \u201cfour or five women\u201d who have accused him \u201cgot paid a lot of money to make up stories.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence of that.Trump, Sept. 26: I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. They refused to even write about it.There were four women, and maybe more \u2014 I think the number is four or five. But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000. Another one had other things happen. And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me \u2014 and she is the one that reported it. This woman is incredible. She reported it, instead of taking the money.Trump appears to be referring to a story, first reported by the Hill, in December 2017, about payments California-based attorney Lisa Bloom acknowledged arranging for two of her four clients who accused Trump of sexual harassment and assault. (At least 18 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, according to Time.) But the article didn\u2019t say the women were asked to \u201cmake up stories\u201d about Trump in exchange for money, as the president said. In fact, the Hill reported that the two women \u201cstressed that Bloom never asked them to make any statements or allegations except what they believed to be true.\u201dIn one case, Bloom set up a GoFundMe account that aimed to raise $10,000 \u2014 but has so far only collected around $2,600 \u2014 to help support Jill Harth, a client who alleged that Trump groped her in 1992 and again in 1993. \u201cShe endured a tidal wave of hate for it,\u201d Bloom said in a statement to the Hill. \u201cIt was very painful for her. And as a New York City makeup artist, Jill lost jobs after she came out publicly against Donald Trump. I believed that people wanted to donate to help her, so we set up the GoFundMe account.\u201dThe Hill reported that Bloom also secured for Harth \u201ca small payment from the licensing of some photos to the news media,\u201d and arranged for an unidentified donor to pay off the mortgage on Harth\u2019s apartment in Queens. The amount for the mortgage \u201cwas under $30,000,\u201d according to the article, not $52,000, as Trump claimed.The Hill said that Harth spoke publicly about Trump\u2019s alleged harassment only after her name and the details of the 1997 lawsuit she filed against him surfaced in news reports during the summer before the 2016 election. The fact that Harth filed suit in 1997 undercuts Trump\u2019s claim now that she was paid to make up stories about him. \u201cShe asked Bloom to represent her in the fall after hearing Trump describe her allegations against him as false,\u201d the paper said.\u201cNothing that you\u2019ve said to me about my mortgage or the Go Fund Me that was created to help me out financially affects the facts or the veracity of my 1997 federal complaint,\u201d Harth said in a statement to the Hill.In the other case, a woman who requested to remain anonymous told the Hill that Bloom said she could get as much as $750,000 for \u201cgoing public with an allegation of an unsolicited advance by Trump on the 1990s beauty contest circuit.\u201d That was actually much lower than the $2 million the woman had requested, citing concerns for her safety, Bloom said. (The woman didn\u2019t dispute the claim that she asked for $2 million. The Hill said she acknowledged trying to see how much she could get or discover who was donating the money. )The woman actually supported Trump in 2016, and said \u201cshe held no resentment about the early 1990s advance because Trump stopped it as soon as she asked him,\u201d the Hill said.She had been contemplating sharing her story about Trump in order to support her friend Harth, who had put her in contact with Bloom\u2019s law firm. She changed her mind several times about coming forward, but ultimately decided not to go public with her accusation. She later approached the Hill with information about Bloom\u2019s financial offers after she learned that Bloom had been representing disgraced film executive Harvey Weinstein, who also has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.Furthermore, it isn\u2019t exactly accurate that \u201cmainstream media refused to put\u201d the story on TV, or \u201ceven write about it,\u201d as Trump claimed. Perhaps no news outlet gave the story as much time as conservative commentator Sean Hannity did on his Fox News Channel show on Dec. 15, 2017. But ABC News did air a segment featuring Bloom\u2019s response to the Hill\u2019s report on the weekend edition of \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Dec. 16, 2017. The New York Times also included some details about Bloom attempting to arrange payments for clients in a Dec. 31, 2017, story about how \u201cpolitical partisans\u201d on the left and right were \u201craising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support accusers who come forward with charges against President Trump and members of Congress, even amid questions about their motivation.\u201dThat Times story mentioned that women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who is Bloom\u2019s mother, also raised money for her then-client Summer Zervos, who alleged that Trump kissed and groped her without consent on separate occasions in New York and Los Angeles. Zervos competed on Trump\u2019s old reality TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Her defamation lawsuit against Trump, who called her allegations lies, is still ongoing. Earlier this month, lawyers for Trump and Zervos agreed their clients would provide sworn answers to written questions by Sept. 28. Trump said another woman told a \u201ctotal phony story\u201d about how he \u201cattacked her while people were coming onto a plane.\u201d That\u2019s not how she described the assault.Trump: It\u2019s happened to me many times. I\u2019ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane. And I have a number-one bestseller out? I mean it was total phony story. There are many of them.In October 2016, Jessica Leeds told the New York Times that Trump \u201cgrabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt,\u201d according to the paper. She said this happened over three decades earlier, when she was sitting next to Trump in first class on a flight to New York.She never claimed it happened as \u201cpeople were coming onto the plane,\u201d as Trump said. According to the article, the alleged incident happened around 45 minutes into the flight. She alleges Trump moved the armrest and then touched her, causing her to run to the back of the plane. The Times said it spoke with four other people with whom Leeds had shared her story.Trump\u2019s campaign later offered its own witness, Anthony Gilberthorpe, who said he saw Leeds and Trump interacting on the plane and that Trump did not make sexual advances on her. \u201cIt was she that was the one being flirtatious,\u201d Gilberthorpe said, according to a note the Trump campaign provided to the New York Post.In his press conference, Trump suggested he would never have done what Leeds described because he had \u201ca number-one best-seller out\u201d at the time. But Gilberthorpe claimed he was on the flight with Trump and Leeds in 1980 or 1981. Trump\u2019s first book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which he wrote with journalist Tony Schwartz, wasn\u2019t published until 1987.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4439}

{"claim_id":"34383","hypothesis":"Coconut oil is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.","explanation_1":"There are plausible mechanisms behind the notion that coconut oil could help with Alzheimer's, but the research is in its infancy.","premise":"The cause of Alzheimer\u2019s is unknown, although theories abound. Some\u00a0evidence\u00a0suggests that one cause could be related to lack of glucose metabolism in certain parts of the brain, as\u00a0described\u00a0in a 2014 case study published in\u00a0Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience: The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body, and under most conditions, relies almost exclusively on glucose for its energy needs. Using [a chemical tracer], the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) can be measured. [Chemical tracer] studies in the early 1980s compared AD subjects with normal controls and found significant diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) in AD patients. Coconut oil contains relatively high levels of medium-chain fatty acids, which break down into ketones in your stomach. Ketones can also be used as a source of energy for the brain (a process called ketosis) and there are at least some suggestions that ketones can help pick up the slack in a glucose-deprived brain suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s. A 2014\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0Neurobiology Aging\u00a0compared the cognitive effects of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s after being treated with either a single dose of a specific chain fatty acid found in coconut oil, or a placebo: A single 40\u2009g dose of [caprylic triglyceride, a fatty acid] induced mild ketosis and a significant positive correlation between performance on [a] paragraph recall task and [concentrations of ketones in the blood] was found. The scientific research in this area is in its infancy, and claims that coconut oil specifically, or ketosis in general, can play a role in ameliorating the affects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease require more research.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":7688}
{"claim_id":"34697","hypothesis":"NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre was disqualified from the draft due to a psychological condition.","explanation_1":"A years-old Internet rumor suggests the gun rights figurehead may not be mentally sound enough to pass a background check.","premise":"It was originally organized in 1871 to \u201cpromote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis\u201d in the United States, and it seems to have succeeded; generations later, the National Rifle Association\u00a0has become the United States\u2019 most high-profile gun rights lobbying group. The organization\u2019s executive vice president and CEO is Wayne R. LaPierre, an outspoken defender of the Second Amendment and critic of all but the most minimal gun control policies. In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 which resulted in the deaths of more than two dozen children and adults, LaPierre famously suggested\u00a0that a \u201cnational database of lunatics\u201d would do more to solve the nation\u2019s gun violence problem than banning the assault-style weapons so often used in such crimes. LaPierre\u2019s repeated assertions linking gun violence with mental illness (assertions vigorously challenged\u00a0by mental health professionals) appear to have backfired on him, at least on the Internet, supplying fodder for rumors and memes promoting the claim that he obtained a medical (4-F) draft deferment during the Vietnam War by reason of a \u201cnervous disorder.\u201d Most variants state or imply that he actually faked the condition: NRA President Wayne LaPierre rec\u2019d Viet Nam draft deferment for mental illness labeled \u201cnervous disorder\u201d.

Coward with a gun. Great combo #NRAFail \u2014 Progressive Texas (@ProgressiveTex) February 8, 2013  NRA Lapierre dodged Vietnam draft by claiming \u201cnervous disorder\u201d. Due to this mental illness, it\u2019s time to give his guns back #gunsense : \u2014 US Gun Violence (@usgunviolence6) January 3, 2017  Although we were unable to ascertain precisely when or where this claim first appeared, it dates back at least as far as 2006, when the following entry was added to an informal online database\u00a0called \u201cWho Served in the Military?\u201d: Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association\u00a0\u2014 did not serve (apparently pulled lottery #97 in 1969 as a campus radical at SUNY-Albany, but weaseled out by getting a family doctor to claim he had a nervous disorder). No sources were cited to corroborate this entry. According to the registrar\u2019s office of the State University of New York in Albany, Wayne LaPierre never attended the school. On the contrary, after graduating from Patrick Henry High School in Roanoke, Virginia in 1967, LaPierre entered Siena College in Loudonville, New York, from which (according to a\u00a0statement from the college) he graduated in 1972. He went on to earn a postgraduate degree at Boston College. Given his birthdate (8 November 1949), LaPierre would indeed have been assigned the number 97 in the first-ever Selective Service lottery of the Vietnam era, placing him in the \u201cmost likely to be drafted\u201d category for 1970. However, we\u2019ve found no public record or published mention of LaPierre ever having served in the military. Our queries to the NRA public affairs office concerning Mr. LaPierre\u2019s military service and\/or draft deferment status went unanswered. We were able to obtain Wayne LaPierre\u2019s Selective Service record from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, however. It shows that he registered for the draft on 13 November 1967, a few days after his 18th birthday, listing his occupation as \u201cstudent.\u201d Under the rules then in force, a registrant could qualify for a student deferment \u201cif he could show he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress in virtually any field of study,\u201d the Selective Service web site says. LaPierre\u2019s Selective Service classification record shows that he was classified 2-S (registrant deferred because of activity in study) in January 1968. His student deferment was renewed every year through 1970. Although the student deferment should have kept him immune from the draft until he graduated in 1972, the record states that LaPierre reported for an armed services physical exam in August 1971 (while still at Siena College), and shortly thereafter was reclassified 1-Y (registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency). During the Vietnam War period, receiving a 1-Y classification was essentially the same as being classified 4-F (registrant not qualified for military service). The 1-Y deferment was eliminated at the end of 1971, at which time all registrants who had previously received it, LaPierre among them, were administratively reclassified 4-F. Like that of Donald Trump, who also received a 1-Y draft deferment, LaPierre\u2019s classification record includes the notation \u201cyxx,\u201d meaning he was found unqualified for military service based on medical reasons. However, it does not state the exact nature of the disqualifying condition(s). We can confirm, then, that in NRA executive president Wayne LaPierre received a medical deferment from the draft in 1971, but to date no evidence has come to light proving it was because of a \u201cnervous disorder\u201d (feigned or real), or any other psychological condition.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":8743}

Regardless of the specific species of snake, these photographs appear to provide a genuine look at the painful aftermath of a venomous snakebite. News.com.au talked to Brian Fry, an associate professor in the school of biological sciences at the University of Queensland, when these images first went viral:\u00a0 \u201cThat type of snake [Sharp-nosed viper] has a venom that is extremely tissue destroying,\u201d Dr Fry told news.com.au. \u201cThe reason for this is that they kill their prey by haemorrhagic shock, where some parts of the venom damage the blood vessel walls, while other parts destroy the ability of the blood to clot, leading to a state of massive internal bleeding in a prey animal.\u201d As Associate Professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland, Dr Fry said because it is a Chinese snake; antivenom for a bite like this might be hard to come by in remote areas. \u201cIf it was in a private collection somewhere, they probably didn\u2019t have it and likely none of the nearby zoos would either,\u201d he explained. \u201cThus, they\u2019d have to suffer through the full effects.\u201d While we haven\u2019t been able to find much information about this specific set of photographs, we have found other snake-bite cases that resulted in similar injuries. A 2015 article from the BBC explained some of the science behind deadly venomous snake bites: Snake venom is made up of several hundred proteins which all have a slightly different toxic effect on the human body. One snake\u2019s poison may not be like another\u2019s, even if they are from the same species. But, on the whole, there are two main ways snakes make us suffer \u2014 by attacking the circulatory system (ie. the blood) and\/or the nervous system. Haemotoxic venom goes for the bloodstream. It can trigger lots of tiny blood clots and then when the venom punches holes in blood vessels causing them to leak, there is nothing left to stem the flow and the patient bleeds to death. Other venoms can increase blood pressure, decrease blood pressure, prevent bleeding or create it. They are all bad news. Neurotoxic venom tends to act more quickly, attacking the nervous system and stopping nerve signals getting through to the muscles. This means paralysis, starting at the head, moving down the body until, if untreated, the diaphragm is paralysed and the patient can\u2019t breathe. A classic sign of this is ptosis, when people can\u2019t keep their eyes open. Around the area of the bite, necrosis can set in. That happens when the venom destroys nearby muscles, tissues and cells. Long-term, this can lead to amputations, the loss of the use of a limb or the need for multiple skin grafts.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":136}

The bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the bacteria to \u201cremember\u201d the viruses (or closely related ones). If the viruses attack again, the bacteria produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to target the viruses\u2019 DNA. The bacteria then use Cas9 or a similar enzyme to cut the DNA apart, which disables the virus.He says he did so in order to create children who are immune to human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The announcement was met with criticism and some approval by scientists:It\u2019s \u201cunconscionable \u2026 an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal.\u201cThis is far too premature,\u201d said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being.

Just days later,\u00a0He disappeared\u00a0amid stories that he had been returned to Shenzhen:Over the weekend, some media outlets reported that the scientist had been brought back to Shenzhen by the university\u2019s president.The reports claimed he was being kept under effective house arrest after he made an appearance at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing in Hong Kong on Wednesday.It is not yet clear what has happened to He or why.

{"claim_id":"34449","hypothesis":"\"Planned Parenthood enforces \"\"abortion quotas\"\" and rewards well-performing employees for promoting abortion services.\"","explanation_1":"UPDATE: 18 February 2017 \u2014 Added notice that, contrary to Planned Parenthood\u2019s statement, Sue Thayer\u2019s lawsuit against the organization has not been completely dismissed.)","premise":"In February 2017 multiple web outlets covered anti-abortion group Live Action\u2019s claims that the Planned Parenthood organization enforces \u201cabortion quotas\u201d and distributes awards to staff members for achieving what amounts to abortion-related \u201csales goals.\u201d The claims\u00a0originated with a 7 February 2017 video clip published by Live Action, depicting an interview between the organization\u2019s Lila Rose and a woman identified as former Planned Parenthood worker Sue Thayer:  Thayer\u2019s relationship\u00a0to Planned Parenthood was not discussed in the video beyond a description of her as a former employee. But a Catholic World Report article\u00a0reported that Thayer maintained anti-abortion views for the entirety of her 17-year employment with the Planned Parenthood organization: Sue Thayer worked for a Planned Parenthood clinic in Storm Lake, Iowa for 17 years. She began in 1991 as a family planning assistant, and soon became a manager. She joined Planned Parenthood because she was interested in women\u2019s health care, the pay was good, and it was close to her home. Thayer was opposed to abortion, but since it was not performed at her particular clinic, she agreed to work there. However, she had to train at a Des Moines clinic watching a full day of abortions being performed. She said, \u201cIt made me want all the more to prevent unplanned pregnancies [through the distribution of contraceptives] \u2026 At nine weeks, the baby is fully formed. He has tiny fingernails and facial features. He\u2019s a human being.\u201d According to Planned Parenthood, Thayer unsuccessfully \u201cled [an] effort\u201d to prosecute the organization in Iowa in 2011, alleging Medicaid fraud\u00a0with respect to the dispensing of birth control pills: Thayer led a failed effort in 2011 claiming Medicaid fraud at the Iowa affiliate related to birth control pills. In 2011, Thayer filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood\u2019s Iowa affiliate \u201cunder both federal and Iowa False Claims Acts, alleging that Planned Parenthood knowingly committed Medicaid fraud from 2002 to 2009 by seeking improper and even illegal reimbursements from Iowa Medicaid Enterprise and the Iowa Family Planning Network.\u201d The allegations included that Planned Parenthood submitted \u201crepeated false, fraudulent, and\/or ineligible [Medicaid] claims for reimbursements.\u201d Thayer claimed that the affiliate \u201cscammed American taxpayers by filing nearly 500,000 fraudulent Medicaid claims over 10 years, netting the organization an illicit $28 million.\u201d A district court judge dismissed the lawsuit in 2012. In August 2014, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit reinstated Thayer\u2019s \u201clawsuit against Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.\u201d Later in 2014, the Appeals Court dismissed the case, \u201cfinding that [Thayer] failed \u2018to provide a single specific example of a particular fraudulent claim Planned Parenthood submitted to the government, let alone any representative examples.\u2019\u201d Although John Jarvey, chief federal judge for southern Iowa, dismissed Thayer\u2019s whole case in 2012, a federal appeals court in 2014 upheld only a portion of his dismissal and sent the rest of the case back to district court, where Jarvey issued a new ruling rejecting some of her claims while allowing others to proceed: For example, the judge dismissed her claim that Planned Parenthood fraudulently billed Medicaid for services for which the agency also received private donations, and for medications for which there was no \u201cvalid patient-practitioner relationship.\u201d But the judge declined to dismiss Thayer\u2019s claim that Planned Parenthood defrauded Medicaid by billing for birth-control pills that were dispensed before a physician or nurse practitioner had written specific prescriptions for them. He also declined to dismiss Thayer\u2019s claim that Planned Parenthood illegally billed Medicaid for abortion-related services, such as blood tests and office visits for women who had their pregnancies terminated. Federal law bans Medicaid payment for most abortions. Like Thayer, Anderson accepted a position at Planned Parenthood despite her reservations about the clinic\u2019s operations: From early 2010 through July 2012, Anderson was a nurse who, among other duties, dispersed sedatives intravenously to clients at the Planned Parenthood abortion facility in Indianapolis. That center is the state\u2019s largest provider of abortions. When she started working there, Anderson said she was \u201con the fence about abortion.\u201d On 8 February 2017, Lila Rose shared a related item via Facebook (reproduced above) showing an award certificate given to a Colorado Planned Parenthood\u00a0branch commending Aurora for \u201cexceeding abortion visits\u201d in early 2013 over the same period in 2012. The certificate suggests abortion visits are one metric used by Planned Parenthood to gauge clinics\u2019 efficacy in dispensing care, but what other metrics Planned Parenthood uses are unknown, and the photograph doesn\u2019t document any tangible reward given out beyond the certificate itself. Planned Parenthood\u2019s archived response to the photograph when it first circulated in July 2014 was to say: First, and plainly, Planned Parenthood does not have \u201cquotas\u201d for any of our services. \u2026, no, we don\u2019t have quotas. And, yes, we absolutely do celebrate our progress in ensuring that more people have access to the full range of reproductive health care, including abortion. And we always will. We contacted Planned Parenthood about the claims, and a spokesperson reiterated that Planned Parenthood maintains no \u201cquotas\u201d for abortions or any of the other services they provide. Another longtime employee of Planned Parenthood whom we spoke had never heard of abortion quotas throughout the duration of her tenure with the organization.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":7540}

GotNews\u2019 source tells us that Zervos\u2019 sexual harassment accusation against Trump is a \u201ccompletely fabricated hoax.\u201d Zervos was paid half a million dollars by Gloria Allred, which is being paid out \u201cslowly over time\u201d according to our source.

","explanation_1":"Japan\u2019s Tohoku Electric Power said on Wednesday it has won initial regulatory approval to restart a reactor at its Onagawa power plant, more than 8 years after it was damaged in the earthquake and tsunami that caused the Fukushima disaster.","premise":"Tohoku Electric said in a statement it has received a first green light from Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority to restart the No. 2 reactor at Onagawa, subject to a public consultation period. Onagawa was the closest among Japan\u2019s nuclear stations to the epicenter of the magnitude-9 quake in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that killed nearly 20,000 people, as well as causing the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. The station was swamped by the tsunami, but survived with its cooling system intact, saving its reactors from the threat of meltdowns similar to those that occurred at Tokyo Electric Power\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi station to the south. Further approvals will be required before the restart, along with the consent of local authorities, which is not guaranteed. The reactor is a boiling water reactor (BWR) with the same basic design as those that melted down in the Fukushima crisis. Tohoku Electric expects to spend 340 billion yen ($3.1 billion) on safety upgrades at the Onagawa plant, including for a wall stretching 800 meters (2,625-ft) in length and standing as tall as 29 meters above sea level to protect it from tsunamis. Restarting the No. 2 reactor will save the utility 35 billion yen each year in fuel costs, he said. The Fukushima disaster led to the eventual shutdown of the country\u2019s then-54 operational reactors, which once provided nearly a third of Japan\u2019s electricity. All had to be relicensed under new standards after the disaster highlighted operational and regulatory failings. While the approval will be a boost for Japan\u2019s resurgent nuclear industry, the sector will still miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country\u2019s electricity by 2030, an analysis by Reuters showed last year. Nine reactors have been restarted, all of them pressurized water reactors located far from Tokyo, while the stigma of Fukushima still hangs over use of the older BWR technology. The issue of nuclear safety in Japan was highlighted again earlier this week when Pope Francis - who met victims of the Fukushima nuclear disaster while in Japan over the weekend - said nuclear energy should not be used until there are ironclad guarantees that it is safe for people and the environment.

{"claim_id":"34197","hypothesis":"\"In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Louis Vuitton sponsored \"\"human zoos\"\" in which black people were put on display like exotic circus animals.\"","explanation_1":"We reached out to the Louis Vuitton\u00a0company and the Fondation\u00a0Louis Vuitton\u00a0for comment on this subject, but did not receive replies.","premise":"French designer Louis Vuitton\u00a0(1821-1892), whose initials are enshrined in the name of the multi-billion-dollar fashion conglomerate\u00a0LVMH, began his career as an apprentice malletier\u00a0(trunk maker) in Paris in the 1830s. Over time, he parlayed his artisanship into a successful business catering to upper-class Parisians, opening his first independent shop in 1854. By the time of his death in 1892, the Louis Vuitton\u00a0brand\u00a0was synonymous with luxury, a reputation built upon by his son and subsequent generations of the\u00a0Vuitton family. According to an assortment of memes making the social media rounds since early 2019, that brand\u00a0was tainted by its alleged participation an 19th- and early 20th-century phenomenon known as \u201chuman zoos.\u201d These were zoo-like exhibitions of so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d peoples displayed in world\u2019s fairs and traveling shows in Europe and the United States during the era of global colonialism. Though they were more often known at the time by the quasi-scientific name \u201cethnological exhibitions,\u201d these displays came to be seen as emblematic of the racism and inhumanity underlying the colonialist mindset. The memes allege that Louis Vuitton\u00a0\u201csponsored\u201d such exhibitions in major cities throughout the world: While you\u2019re now complaining about gucci and last year it was Prada and Moncler, did you know that in the late 1800s and in the early 1900s Louis Vuitton sponsored human zoos were black People were looked at as exotic circus like creatures. Here is a picture of a Louis Vuitton pic.twitter.com\/a28f6iUx1v \u2014 Thywill Brown (@Brownthywill) February 12, 2019   The posts failed to make clear whether the allegation is meant to apply to Louis Vuitton,\u00a0the man, or Louis Vuitton,\u00a0the company, or both. They also failed to provide any real evidentiary support for the allegation. Some of the posts, such as the Facebook message above (since deleted), included a link to\u00a0the blog \u201cBrand Memory,\u201d which contains an article\u00a0mentioning\u00a0that Louis Vuitton showcased products at several world\u2019s fairs and at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition, at which, the article says, \u201chuman zoos\u201d were exhibited. But the article doesn\u2019t claim that the\u00a0company (Louis Vuitton\u00a0was long deceased by 1931) actually played any part in such zoos. The mentions appear in these paragraphs describing a 2010\u00a0Carnavalet Museum retrospective on the evolution of the\u00a0Vuitton\u00a0style (emphasis added): The next room deals with transport \u2013 with the miniature of a stagecoach and all the types of traveling trunks such as Tea Cases, the car trunk \u2013 and with World Fairs, which led to so many creations! Louis Vuitton attended them from 1867 and won many prizes there. During the great 1900 Fair, Georges Vuitton is in charge of the organization of the traveling objects and leather goods section. Therefore, he is outside the competition. Nevertheless, he displays \u2013 as we learn it \u2013 his own exhibition in a blue carousel reminding you of the Big Wheel. Posters, maps and trunks are there to testify the influence of the World Fairs. But you can also see a magnificent mockup of the 1878 Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro. Then, we discover the design and Africanism of the beginning of the 20th century. If the Arts D\u00e9coratifs are more visible on the Louis Vuitton collection pieces (such as perfume flasks), the ethnical inspirations are directly perceptible on the trunks: crocodile leather, objects made of ivory\u2026 This style was to reach its peak for the colonial exhibition in 1931, whose map lets us perceive the festive aspect of it as well as the \u201chuman zoos.\u201d Though the sentence above is poorly translated and vague, it\u2019s clear enough that the clause referring to \u201chuman zoos\u201d applies to the 1931 Colonial Exposition as a whole, not the Louis\u00a0Vuitton\u00a0pavilion, which existed but had no evident connection to displays of live human beings. According to a museum\u00a0press release,\u00a0in keeping with the colonial theme, the Vuitton\u00a0pavilion showcased Africa-themed\u00a0products (mainly trunks) and artifacts such as masks and totems. (The photograph\u00a0that appears in the social media posts shows that pavilion. It was not, contrary to what the Facebook meme claims, a \u201cLouis Vuitton\u00a0store exhibition\u201d in St. Louis.) In point of fact, according to historical accounts, the only display in the Colonial Exposition of 1931 rightly described as a\u00a0\u201chuman zoo\u201d (namely, a group of indigenous New Caledonians \u2014 \u201cKanaks\u201d \u2014 sensationally billed as \u201cpolygamous savages and cannibals\u201d) was relegated to an offsite location miles away from the main exposition grounds. People (mainly artisans) from other indigenous groups intermingled with visitors and represented their cultures in the exposition proper (in the Bois\u00a0de Vincennes), but the Kanaks\u00a0found themselves confined to the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation\u00a0(in the Bois\u00a0de Boulogne), which at that time also housed an actual zoo with crocodiles and other exotic animals. Infamously, the Jardin\u00a0d\u2019Acclimatation\u00a0had housed a succession of mocked-up \u201cnative villages\u201d since 1877, populated at various times by colonized indigenous peoples. The Kanak\u00a0exhibition would be the last of its kind there before the venue was turned into\u00a0an amusement park. In what some might perceive as an ironic development, the headquarters of the\u00a0Fondation Louis Vuitton, a non-profit entity founded by LVMH\u00a0to promote international arts and culture, was erected in 2014 in close proximity to where those \u201chuman zoo\u201d exhibitions of previous centuries once stood. But we found nothing in any of the historical sources we examined to connect Louis Vuitton\u00a0to any such displays \u2014 not at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition, not at world\u2019s fairs where the company was known to have displayed its wares, and not in traveling shows in the United States or other parts of the world. While it could be argued that the company engaged in cultural appropriation over the course of its long history, and perhaps even profited from the trappings of colonialism.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":5692}

Gov. Mary Taylor says 'Obamacare' would require purchase of unnecessary insurance","premise":"\"Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor also heads the state Department of Insurance. She makes no secret of her dislike for what she derisively calls \"\"Obamacare,\"\" the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In June, Taylor wrote a guest column for newspapers in which she said, \"\"I will do everything I can to protect Ohio\u2019s citizens and job creators from this catastrophic law.\"\" She followed it by giving a speech with a similar theme. In another guest column for newspapers that was posted Sept. 8 to the Department of Insurance website, Taylor says the health care law will limit choice and increase cost for consumers. \"\"The law\u2019s heavy-handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want,\"\" she wrote. \"\"Say for example, you do not have any children. Under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it. \"\"Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach. By requiring consumers to buy services they do not want or need, costs will rise significantly.\"\" That got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention. Would consumers really be forced to buy unnecessary coverage, like pediatric, maternity and newborn care for people with no children? We asked Taylor's office for support. We were referred to Section 1302 of the Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. \"\"It addresses the essential health benefits,\"\" a spokesman for Taylor said. We read Section 1302, and it seemed to bear out Taylor's assertion. But we were frankly confused by the wording, and we turned for guidance to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source on health care issues. \"\"It is true that this (pediatric, maternity and newborn care) is covered as part of the essential benefits package,\"\" a spokesman told us. \"\"The law does mandate that insurance.\"\" But the spokesman added more: Current employer-provided insurance plans \"\"may include coverage you will never use or need, such as maternity care for a man or prostate cancer coverage for women.\"\" Wanting further explanation, we talked with Neera Tanden, who worked on the health care legislation as senior advisor for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services. She is currently CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \"\"Ninety percent of all plans cover everything described in the bill as 'essential health benefits package,\"\" she said. \"\"People are paying for all those benefits today. We all pay for things we never use. It is the nature of insurance.\"\" Individual policies are usually more expensive, offer fewer benefits and are less regulated than group plans, she said, noting that Section 1302 of the health care act says that the scope of the package should equal the scope of benefits \"\"under a typical employer plan.\"\" The act also bans exclusions for \"\"preexisting conditions\"\" that exclusively or primarily affect women and ends the practice of charging women higher premiums than men, she said. \"\"The thrust of (Taylor's) case is there should be no requirements on what insurance companies offer,\"\" Tanden said. Wanting the perspective of an authority without a dog in the political fight, we turned to J.B. Silvers at Case Western Reserve University. He is professor of health care finance and professor of banking and finance at the Weatherhead School of Management, faculty director of the Health Systems Management Center and holds a joint appointment in the School of Medicine. He also is former CEO of a health plan and insurance company. Silvers said the health care plan \"\"makes the playing field level\"\" by setting a standard for benefit packages. \"\"It is true you could buy some sort of stripped-down policy,\"\" he said, but such plans are \"\"almost universally a bad deal\"\" with higher costs. Normally, he said, a company negotiates coverage for employees, and \"\"wouldn't offer one plan for single males and another for people with families.\"\" What does that say about the accuracy of Taylor's statement? \"\"It's irrelevant,\"\" Silvers said. \"\"It's a silly argument, frankly. Insurance by definition includes things you don't think you need.\"\" What it means to us is that Taylor, the top official at the state department that oversees insurance, was accurate in describing provisions of what she calls Obamacare. But it is misleading to imply that health insurance policies are purchased a la carte, that such purchasing would reduce costs to consumers, and that the \"\"essential benefits package\"\" represents a departure from current group plans. And when a statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, it rates  on the Truth-O-Meter.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6848}
{"claim_id":"26777","hypothesis":"The mortality rate for the flu is \u201cright around\u201d that of the new coronavirus: \u201cIt\u2019s right around 2%.\u201d","explanation_1":"\"The mortality rate for the flu is considered by most experts to be about 0.1%. That's \"\"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure,\"\" said\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. Although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually. Estimates for the mortality rate for coronavirus are currently around 2%, but this number could change depending on how cases are diagnosed.\"","premise":"\"During a Senate appropriations Feb. 25 subcommittee hearing, Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, said the U.S. flu mortality rate was about the same as the current estimated global mortality rate of the coronavirus outbreak. He made this statement during an exchange with Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) regarding what the acting secretary knew about the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. This C-SPAN video shows the full discussion between the two. Kennedy first asked what the worldwide mortality rate for coronavirus is, to which Wolf responded, that it was \"\"under 2%\"\" but that he would need to check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual figure and that \"\"it changes daily.\"\" The Louisiana senator then asked, \"\"What\u2019s the mortality rate for influenza over, say, the last 10 years in America?\"\" Wolf answered: \"\"It\u2019s also right around that percentage as well. I don\u2019t have that offhand, but it\u2019s right around 2% as well.\"\" We asked the Department of Homeland Security where Wolf\u2019s figure came from. A DHS spokesperson said in an email, \"\"As the acting secretary said in his hearing, he did not have that information on hand and refers to Health and Human Services -- the federal agency in charge of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus response.\"\" The comparison of coronavirus to flu in terms of mortality rates seemed like an important mechanism to understanding the growing concern about the reach of coronavirus, so we decided to dig deeper to find out if these statistics hold up. We also asked experts to explain what the numbers mean in terms of risk. Digging into mortality rate numbers The CDC directed us to its online influenza resources and referred us to the World Health Organization for more information on coronavirus. Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, called it \"\"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.\"\" It\u2019s important to note, that although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually. Now, for coronavirus. According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. (These numbers reflect the information available at the time of the secretary\u2019s testimony.) But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus. \"\"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\"\" said Mores. \"\"They have changed their case definitions multiple times. It\u2019s murky what has gone into the case count and who has gone into being counted on cases.\"\" The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%. Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%. Right now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. \"\"We don\u2019t have any evidence to that being the case,\"\" said Osterholm. Mores said U.S. health officials just don\u2019t have enough information to know whether the two mortality rates are similar. Understanding this comparison would offer a means to better understand the severity of the coronavirus. It could also help in educating the public about the novel illness. \"\"Until we can gain our own experience with this virus, it\u2019s going to be pretty squishy. So, all the numbers that you have come across here are within the range of possibility,\"\" he said. \"\"Absolutely, the hope is we will end up with something similar to the flu, but we just don\u2019t know yet.\"\" Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"\"confirmed cases.\"\" Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down. This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis. One key difference between the flu and the coronavirus illness, Osterholm cautioned, is that, with the flu, the population has a partially built up immunity, whether through receiving flu shots or already having been exposed to the illness. Mores concurred. \"\"You know, the risk is this: We have a brand-new virus in a completely naive population on Earth, we\u2019re all susceptible to it. Everyone is potentially infectable with this virus,\"\" he said. \"\"Even with a high transmission rate and the low case fatality rate, that still becomes a massive number of ill and fatal cases.\"\" Our ruling There are two ways to parse out this claim: First, is it true that the average U.S. mortality rate for flu is 2%? That\u2019s not true, according to data from the CDC and exchanges with multiple global health experts. On average, the flu mortality rate during the past 10 years has been 0.1%. In addition, Wolf and a DHS spokesperson admitted that the acting secretary did not have the statistics in front of him when he answered questions at the hearing about the mortality rates. Second, is it true the COVID-19 mortality rate is similar to the flu mortality rate? Wolf is also wrong on that account, based on the limited information currently known about the coronavirus. Recent data from the Chinese government set the COVID-19 mortality rate at 2.3%. That\u2019s vastly different from the flu\u2019s mortality rate of 0.1%. Experts also said that while it\u2019s possible the mortality rate from the new virus could come close to the flu\u2019s mortality rate eventually \u2015 if the case definition of coronavirus is expanded -- it\u2019s too soon to make that assumption with the limited information available.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":112}
{"claim_id":"11248","hypothesis":"Acupuncture Eases Depression in Pregnancy","explanation_1":"This story reports on a small, randomized trial evaluating acupuncture for the treatment of depression in pregnant women. This story has numerous flaws, the biggest of which was relying heavily on the press release. By relying on a news release for quotes, this story missed some of the caveats and words of caution from researchers and independent experts that we saw in other stories.","premise":"There was no discussion regarding the cost of acupuncture, a particularly important omission since acupuncture is not covered by all insurance companies. The story tells the us that acupuncture significantly improved symptoms compared to the other treatment groups, but then it states that there was no difference in remission rates. A discussion on what this mixed outcome means would have been\u00a0useful. While acupuncture is generally safe, the story should have mentioned that 21 women in the study reported transient pain at the site of needle insertion and 1 woman experienced bleeding. The story did a nice job describing the study methods, pointing out that the patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group and that the people measuring their outcome were not aware which treatment the patients were receiving. These are all signs of a rigorous study design, but the story does not tell the reader why these methods are so\u00a0important. The story also should have noted that a study with 150 participants is still relatively small. This story indicates that 14% of pregnant women may suffer from depression; however, the writer might have also noted that 3-5% of pregnant women have actually been diagnosed. No independent experts were interviewed for this story.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":8971}

","explanation_1":"A major wildfire threatened thousands of homes and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Los Angeles on Wednesday as the fiercest Santa Ana winds yet lashed Southern California, forcing meteorologists to create new alert levels to warn of the danger.","premise":"The blaze erupted early on Wednesday morning in Simi Valley, northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, and by nightfall had charred 1,300 acres (526 hectares) as crews fought to protect the Reagan library and some 7,000 homes in the path of the flames. The Easy Fire, which forced 26,000 people to flee, broke out some 30 miles (48 km) from a separate conflagration burning in shrub-covered hills near the Getty Center museum that has displaced thousands of residents from some of the city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. The Getty museum houses a collection that includes paintings by Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Manet, ancient Greek statues and an expansive array of manuscripts. The Reagan Library, Getty Center and Getty Villa in Malibu were all forced to close due to the flames and thick clouds of smoke, although all three facilities were said to be out of imminent danger by evening. \u201cThe dedication of our staff and the professionalism of our region\u2019s first responders has been nothing short of heroic,\u201d  Getty president Jim Cuno said in a statement posted on the center\u2019s website. The Santa Ana winds were blamed for a string of fire outbreaks across Southern California. In Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, a wind-driven brush fire swiftly blackened 250 acres (101 hectares), forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people from two mobile home parks and a nursing home, county fire spokesman Rob Roseen said. Weather conditions were at their worst, with fierce winds hurling burning embers through the air across bone-dry brush to ignite spot fires. \u201cThe fire outflanked us very rapidly today, pushed by those 40- to 50-mile-per-hour (40- to 80 km per hour) winds,\u201d Ventura County Fire Department assistant chief Chad Cook told reporters. \u201cWe did experience gusts up to 65 miles per hour (105 kph) this morning, which made long-range spotting very, very dangerous.\u201d  He said erratic, high winds also forced intermittent grounding of firefighting aircraft through the day. The National Weather Service issued an unprecedented \u201cextreme red flag\u201d warning for wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties ahead of two days of intense, dry wind gusts that were forecast to reach near-hurricane force. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen us use this warning,\u201d forecaster Marc Chenard said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d   Statewide, the weather service issued alerts for \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d fire hazards covering more than 34,000 square miles (88,000 square km), encompassing some 21 million people. Power was cut off to nearly 400,000 homes and businesses statewide on Wednesday as a precaution by the state\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp (PCG.N), and other utilities. The so-called Easy fire in Simi Valley broke out just before dawn off a road named Easy Street, sending a wall of flames racing across scrub-covered slopes at the edge of the hilltop Reagan Library, which houses the late president\u2019s archives and memorabilia. Pre-positioned strike teams of firefighters, backed by water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers dumping payloads of fire retardant, swarmed the area as flames closed in on the library campus. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded. It\u2019s a scary situation. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get on top of it,\u201d John Heubusch, the library\u2019s executive director, said in an interview with KNX radio in Los Angeles during the firefight. \u201cIt\u2019s as close as it gets.\u201d  By late morning, emergency crews had largely subdued flames, and the fire moved off in other directions. The blaze prompted public schools and at least five college campuses in the area to cancel classes for the day. Health authorities were handing out disposable air filter masks to members of the public at five cites around the county. On nearby ranches, residents in the protective face masks scrambled to coax nervous horses and other livestock into trailers to drive them to safety. \u201cAs long as we get up, get out of here, get the car moving, everything else can be replaced in theory so you know breathing at the end of the day is better than not breathing at the end of the day,\u201d resident David Pollack told Reuters. The Santa Ana winds are a regional weather phenomenon that sends gusts westward off the desert to the east, through mountain passes toward the coast. They were forecast to reach sustained speeds of 50 to 70 mph (80 to 110 kph) on Wednesday and Thursday. Investigators say the Getty fire was likely caused by a broken tree branch blown into power lines during high winds on Monday morning. It spread, consuming 745 acres (300 hectares) by Wednesday morning, with about a quarter contained by firefighters. At least 12 homes have been destroyed. In northern California, firefighters struggled for a sixth day against the 76,000-acre (30,760-hectare) Kincade fire in Sonoma County\u2019s wine country. That blaze has destroyed at least 189 homes and other structures but was listed as 30 percent contained on Wednesday. PG&E acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire started near a damaged transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line on that tower malfunctioned. The company filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018. As many as 190,000 people were displaced at the height of the Kincade fire, but some evacuations have since been lifted.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6151}

{"claim_id":"11151","hypothesis":"PCSK9-Inhibitor Drug Class That Grew Out of UT Southwestern Research Becomes a Game-Changer for Patient with Extremely High Cholesterol","explanation_1":"Frank Brown, the subject of this news release, with Dr. Khera, his cardiologist.This news release describes one patient\u2019s response to a \u201cgame-changing\u201d new drug designed to help patients manage their cholesterol, and offers a brief history of how this class of drug was developed and how they work. The release offers only anecdotal data on the drug\u2019s efficacy \u2014 it offers numbers for only one patient. What\u2019s more, the release doesn\u2019t even tell readers which drug the patient took (though it narrows it down to one of two drugs). It also tells readers nothing about costs or potential harms, and describes high cholesterol as a disease \u2014 instead of as a risk factor for disease. High levels of cholesterol, especially high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol relative to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are widely considered a significant risk factor for heart disease. However, it is only a risk factor \u2014 it is not a disease in itself. It is important for news releases to characterize this distinction clearly, particularly when the focus of the release is a drug treatment that costs thousands of dollars and carries health risks of its own. That said, the larger question here is why a health research institution issued a news release that offers only anecdotal data on the health of a single patient taking an unspecified drug.","premise":"The release does not address cost at all. While the release does not tell us which of the two new drugs the patient took, it does tell us that he took either evolocumab (sold under the trade name Repatha) or alirocumab (sold under the trade name Praluent). Both drugs are given via injection either once or twice a month. According to press materials issued when Repatha was approved by the FDA in August 2015, \u201cThe U.S. Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) price of Repatha is $542.31 for one 140 mg single-use prefilled SureClick autoinjector or prefilled syringe, or $14,100 annually for the every two weeks administration.\u201d That\u2019s not chump change. According to press materials issued when the FDA approved Praluent last July, \u201cThe U.S. WAC price of Praluent is $40 per day ($1,120 every 28 days) for both the 75 mg and 150 mg doses.\u201d Again, that\u2019s not an insignificant expense. The cost to consumers may vary, depending on each patient\u2019s insurance, etc., but failure to address cost is a significant oversight. This falls short in two different ways. First, the release only tells readers how much one patient\u2019s LDL cholesterol dropped (from 384 to 111). That\u2019s anecdotal data. And, because the release doesn\u2019t tell readers which drug the patient was taking, it is not even clear which drug was responsible for that single patient\u2019s lower cholesterol numbers. Second, the release doesn\u2019t tell readers what this reduction in LDL cholesterol means in terms of the patient\u2019s actual health. Does it reduce the patient\u2019s risk of a heart attack? If so, by how much \u2014 a lot? A little? The release does not mention potential harms at all. If anything, it does just the opposite, saying at one point that an observation of a woman with a genetic variation that naturally confers the effects of this class of drugs suggests that \u201ctherapies aimed at blocking [the protein targeted by these drugs] would not only be effective, but also safe.\u201d That\u2019s a good anecdote about the inspiration for the drug treatment, but it\u2019s problematic in a release that seems to focus almost exclusively on anecdotes. Particularly since the release does not tell readers that both evolocumab and alirocumab have potential adverse side effects. According to the press materials for evolocumab (Repatha), \u201cIn a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha-treated patients.\u201d And the press materials for alirocumab (Praluent) note \u201cPraluent can cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions that can be severe and require treatment in a hospital.\u201d What\u2019s more,\u00a0there could be less common, but more serious adverse effects that will only come to light after large numbers of patients take these drugs for long time. There is nothing in the release that says for how long the drug was used. These potential health effects are worth noting \u2014 especially in a release that focuses solely on the use of a new class of drugs. The release shares incomplete information on one patient\u2019s experience. That is not satisfactory. This is a close call but we think it crosses the line to Not Satisfactory. We stated this above, but it bears repeating: High levels of cholesterol, especially high levels of LDL cholesterol relative to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are widely considered a significant risk factor for heart disease. However, it is only a risk factor \u2014 it is not a disease in itself. The release refers to \u201cdangerously high levels of cholesterol\u201d in its opening paragraph, and it focuses on the story of a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia \u2014 a condition that is known to cause premature heart disease. But it never tells readers that cholesterol is only a risk factor and doesn\u2019t give any insight into how common this condition is or how worried the average reader should be about it. \u201cThere are many more Frank Browns out there \u2013 patients who can\u2019t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs,\u201d the release says. How many? The release doesn\u2019t talk about funding for this individual patient, which is fine. But it does talk about a number of researchers who were involved in developing evolocumab and alirocumab. Were those researchers supported by the relevant drug companies? Does the medical school itself have partnerships with these companies? It\u2019s not clear. If those potential conflicts do not exist, it would have been good to make that clear \u2014 particularly in a case like this, where the rationale for the news release is not clear to readers. The release does mention three other drugs that are designed to reduce cholesterol levels. However, the release would have been stronger if it had also mentioned the importance of diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors that can significantly influence cholesterol levels. The release notes that the drugs have been approved by the FDA, and that at least one of them was available to the patient described in the release. The reader can infer that the drugs are available to the public. The release explains what is novel about this particular class of drugs. However, it\u2019s not at all clear why this release is coming out now. The drugs themselves were approved by the FDA last summer and the release does not appear to be related to the publication of research findings. There is virtually no information here that was not available six months ago, other than the anecdotal data on one patient. We would like to give the release a pass here, because we already dinged the release for the way it discusses cholesterol under \u201cDisease Mongering.\u201d However, we can\u2019t. Here\u2019s why: the release refers to this drug class as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in its headline. What does that mean? Even accepting the fact that the headline says the drug was a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for only one patient, it\u2019s still pretty fuzzy. Did the drug lower the patient\u2019s LDL cholesterol to optimal levels? No, and the release itself says as much. Did the drug significantly reduce the patient\u2019s risk for future heart problems? It\u2019s not clear, because the release doesn\u2019t address that. If a release is going to use hyperbolic language \u2014 whether it\u2019s a \u201cgame-changer\u201d or a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d or a \u201choly grail\u201d \u2014 it needs to clearly lay out the results to back it up. That is not the case here.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":430}
{"claim_id":"10085","hypothesis":"Close Look at Orthotics Raises a Welter of Doubts","explanation_1":"The question posed in the article is basically the following:\u00a0 \u201cAre shoe inserts (foot orthotics) effective in the prevention and treatment of injuries among athletes?\u201d\u2019  Why is this impossibly broad? This question encompasses dozens of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and degenerative conditions involving scores of scientific studies. It would have been better for the article to define its scope more narrowly\u2014e.g., foot injuries, lower limb injuries, or low back pain\u2014 and look at the evidence more carefully. Gazing through the prism of a single scientist\u2019s work, the article presents an interesting narrative about the difficulties of performing biomechanical and clinical research in this area. And it endorses a skeptical attitude in interpreting the claims of proponents in this multi-billion dollar industry. However, the answer to the main question is fundamentally unsatisfying\u2014and \u201csoft\u201d from an evidence perspective: \u201cShoe inserts may be helpful as a short-term solution, preventing injuries in some athletes,\u201d according to the New York Times. This is a soft statement because almost any prevention method or treatment will help somebody over the short-term some of the time. And this permissive conclusion will certainly not deter athletes from seeking out orthotics for dozens of conditions on the premise that they might work. However, this broad-brush conclusion doesn\u2019t adequately characterize the evidence regarding shoe inserts. That evidence cleaves a little more neatly than this article implies. By conventional medical standards (well-designed clinical trials) there is no conclusive evidence that shoe inserts are effective in the prevention and treatment of the majority of athletic injuries. There are a few conditions for which there is preliminary evidence that shoe inserts may offer modest preventive or therapeutic benefits. But importantly, and never mentioned in this article, there are also conditions in which the effectiveness of shoe inserts has been tested and disproven. There is credible evidence, for example, that shoe inserts do not prevent low back pain. If scientists are going to go to the trouble of performing demanding research, it is important that journalists report those results. (See Sahar et al., 2009). Reference: Sahar T et al., Insoles for prevention and treatment of low back pain: a systematic review within the framework of the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group, Spine, 2009; 34(9): 924-933. The role of shoe inserts in the prevention and treatment of athletic injuries remains one of the most controversial topics in sports medicine, orthopedics and podiatry. Musculoskeletal pain is a universal complaint in the general population and prompts tens of millions of physician visits every year. The idea of relieving and preventing pain and dysfunction with a simple insole or insert is beguiling. The aging of the general population\u2014and the rising tide of weight gain and obesity\u2014are colliding to create a growth industry for orthotics. Shoe inserts\u2014including inexpensive off-the-shelf products and costly custom-made orthotics\u2014 are widely prescribed and used in the prevention and treatment of foot problems, knee and hip pain, shin splints, low back pain and many other musculoskeletal conditions. Yet after several decades of research the benefit of shoe inserts for most injuries and conditions remains uncertain. And it is not clear if the billions of dollars spent on shoe inserts translates into the wholesale alleviation of pain and dysfunction\u2014or just the wholesale transfer of dollars.","premise":"It would have been useful to discuss the relative costs of off-the-shelf and custom shoe inserts. The former are generally less than $50 while the latter can run into many hundreds of dollars. The article mentions the expensive price-tag of custom-made orthotics. It didn\u2019t, however, discuss the overall costs of off-the-shelf shoe inserts, which have to be replaced with regularity. The article offered a brief characterization of the magnitude of benefits related to orthotics among soldiers in one study. But in general the article did not adequately frame the potential benefits of shoe inserts. For instance, in the review that reported a benefit for orthotics in the prevention and treatment of plantar fasciitis and tibial stress fractures, how impressive was that benefit? This article focused largely on the potential upside of shoe inserts\u2014and didn\u2019t explicitly address potential harms from the use of orthotics. It mentioned that inserts could increase muscle work requirements but didn\u2019t discuss the significance of this point in terms of pain and function. Some of the potential harms\u2014 such as exacerbating injury risk and\/or pain and dysfunction\u2014are obvious. There are more subtle harms as well, such as creating the expectation among athletes that they cannot safely exercise, perform normal daily activities, and work\u00a0 without the aid of an orthotic. It would be difficult if not impossible for a journalist to evaluate the evidence on such a broad topic. And the article didn\u2019t adequately characterize the evidence regarding shoe inserts in the prevention or treatment of most common athletic injuries. It cited a single published review on orthotics and injury prevention for lower leg injuries, but didn\u2019t discuss other reviews of the evidence. There was no suggestion of disease mongering. In fact, the article rebutted the need for orthotics in the correction of mechanical\/alignment problems and in the management of asymptomatic abnormalities such as flat feet. The article did present the views of several independent sources. However, the article did not address or identify potential financial conflicts among the contributors beyond identifying their organizations or institutions. Both biomechanical research and footwear research rely heavily on industry funding, which may skew the views of researchers. So this is an important issue. And we can\u2019t give a satisfactory score for half a loaf. The article did not discuss alternatives to orthotics for athletes. Yet there are many other preventive and therapeutic strategies such as flexibility and strength training, proprioceptive work, and attention to technique which may offer superior benefits to simple insoles and inserts. The article focused mainly on orthotics compared to no intervention. This might be appropriate for prevention, but a symptomatic patient would also be considering other physical treatments and interventions. Both off-the-shelf and custom shoe inserts are widely available. This doesn\u2019t merit discussion. The shoe inserts described in this study are widely available and are not particularly novel in concept or design. The article did not \u201chype\u201d particular orthotics because of innovative characteristics or qualities. The article did not appear to rely on a press release.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6944}

But as her Twitter bio says, she\u2019s \"\"100% alive.\"\" The image in the Facebook post is authentic, and shows Granato after she was injected as part of a coronavirus vaccine at the University of Oxford. She was the first of more than 800 people who were recruited for the first human trial in Europe of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the BBC. Granato, who was the first volunteer to be injected, told the BBC: \"\"I\u2019m a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.\"\" The Department of Health and Social Care in the United Kingdom also used Twitter to dispel misinformation about Granato\u2019s death. \"\"News circulating on social media that the first volunteer in a UK #coronavirus vaccine trial has died is completely untrue,\"\" the April 26 tweet says.

{"claim_id":"17620","hypothesis":"I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history.","explanation_1":"\"Dewhurst said: \"\"I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history.\"\" This statement paints an incomplete picture. About 63 (or 54) measures giving someone a tax break passed into law on Dewhurst\u2019s watch, but it's not like Texans are less tapped by such taxes of late than before. Notably, too, most of the touted laws targeted particular beneficiaries. Also, Dewhurst didn't personally cut any taxes; those decisions involved the House, Senate and governor, though Dewhurst was a leader. The 2006 school property-tax-rate reduction was historic. But this statement fails to acknowledge that actions Dewhurst helped usher into place the same year led to hundreds of millions of dollars in lesser tax increases. All told, this claim contains an element of truth, but overlooks critical facts that would give a full, accurate impression.\"","premise":"\"David Dewhurst, seeking his fourth term as lieutenant governor of Texas, consistently talks up the state\u2019s economy while simultaneously noting tax cuts. The Houston Republican, who presides over the Texas Senate, touted 54 tax cuts in a recent video ad. A bit earlier, in an Oct. 1, 2013, post on his campaign website, he took credit for even more. \"\"Under my leadership, the Texas Senate has helped strengthen our state\u2019s foundation with essential conservative legislation,\"\" Dewhurst said. His post singled out actions to balance budgets, address border security and tort reform, stop Medicaid from expanding, restrict abortions--and to cut taxes. The Senate passed legislation to cut \"\"taxes for all Texans,\"\" Dewhurst\u2019s web post continued. \"\"I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history.\"\" Dozens of Dewhurst-provided cuts? We were curious. Big picture, Texans paid about the same level of taxes in 2010 (the latest year of available data) as they did when Dewhurst took over as lieutenant governor in 2003, according to calculations by the non-partisan Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C. Foundation figures indicate that on average, Texans ponied up 5.7 percent of their personal income for state and local taxes in Texas both of those years. Still, in between that percentage dropped to as little as 5.1 percent, in 2006 and 2008, the figures suggest. After we inquired into Dewhurst\u2019s reference to cutting taxes 63 times, Dewhurst\u2019s campaign blog post was amended to say 54 cuts. We stuck with checking what was posted for about two months. Earlier, to our request for backup information, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine emailed a document headlined \"\"David Dewhurst Tax Cuts\"\" stating that since becoming lieutenant governor, Dewhurst \"\"has cut taxes by more than $15 billion through 63 pieces of legislation.\"\" Among the listed measures, a 2006 measure setting in motion one-third reductions in school district maintenance and operation property tax rates is credited with \"\"savings\"\" of more than $12.6 billion, accounting for 84 percent of Dewhurst\u2019s total declared savings. A convention of Texas state government is to estimate costs and savings in one- or two-year increments. That's probably because lawmakers almost always budget two years at a time. By email, Considine told us the campaign chose to list five-year savings figures when they were available from fiscal notes written by budget board staff at the time the cited measures passed into law. He didn\u2019t say why. Not noted on Dewhurst's backup: The 2006 reduction was partly funded by tax increases. According to a chart emailed to us Dec. 3, 2013, by John Barton, a staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, the various increases were initially projected to raise nearly $4.7 billion in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. In that year, the chart indicates, the property-tax reductions were expected to cost the state about $7 billion--while in reality, the tax hikes generated about $2.5 billion less in 2011 than initially predicted. We took a long look at the campaign's list of tax-cut measures, finding the vast majority to be carefully targeted, that is, not necessarily benefiting every Texan. By our count, about 40 of the changes in law related to exempting particular entities or transactions from sales or property taxes, many of them not lacking a precise savings estimate. Dewhurst\u2019s document lists about 10 sales tax-cut measures. The largest, at a value of about $700 million through five years, is a 2013 law exempting from the sales tax through 2026 \"\"depreciable tangible personal property directly used in qualified research,\"\" the legislation\u2019s fiscal note states. Another 2013 law provided for sales tax refunds to providers of cable or Internet access was projected by the budget board at a value of $250 million over five years. Dewhurst\u2019s document also specifies a 2009 law placing backpacks among items subject to the state\u2019s annual three-day \"\"sales tax holiday,\"\" a change projected to save affected taxpayers more than $40 million over five years, according to the proposal\u2019s fiscal note. Also noted: A 2007 law exempting pay-phone calls from the sales tax at a projected five-year value of more than $6 million, per the relevant state fiscal note. Among about 30 listed measures touching on property taxes, a 2013 law exempted equipment in certain data centers from property taxes at a projected five-year value of $58 million. A 2007 law protecting elderly and disabled homeowners with homestead exemptions from being stuck with potentially higher school taxes was projected by the state to save beneficiaries (and cost the state) $745 million over five years, while a 2009 law giving full homestead exemptions to fully disabled veterans was predicted to be worth more than $50 million over five years. Dewhurst\u2019s document lists a half-dozen laws related to the business franchise tax, though there appears to be a little duplication in that an exemption of small businesses was simply extended. A 2013 law changing who pays the tax, extending a small business exemption and temporarily lowering the tax rate was projected to reduce such tax collections by $1.3 billion over five years. By far, though, the stand-out measure on Dewhurst\u2019s list is House Bill 1, signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry in May 2006 and described by Dewhurst as cutting school property taxes by more than $12.6 billion over five years. We couldn\u2019t confirm that figure, but the budget board chart shows more than $30 billion in state expenditures from 2007 through 2011 to cover the state costs of the tax cuts. Separately, it\u2019s been disputed whether the 2006 actions whittled taxes as much as some ballyhooed. In 2010, we rated as  a Perry claim that \"\"we cut property taxes by one third.\"\" The tax-rate mandate did reduce school property taxes at first. School tax collections declined 6.4 percent between 2005 and 2007, the year the cuts were fully implemented, according to the Texas Education Agency, which also offered us data showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were 30.2 percent lower in 2007 than the state projected they would have been without the tax cut. A business group, the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, reached a similar conclusion by comparing 2007 school property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without the mandated cut. The related savings were about $7 billion, it said. \"\"The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative,\"\" the group concluded. Then again, school property tax collections ultimately increased partly because districts had leeway to inch up their rates over the years and benefited, in many cases, from increasing property values. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. The taxpayer association identified other reasons that the overall reduction in property taxes did not meet expectations: increases in the portion of school taxes dedicated to bond debt, as well as increases in taxes paid to cities, counties and other taxing districts. As we noted above, Dewhurst\u2019s declared tax cuts were accompanied by some tax hikes intended to make up a portion of the school revenue lost due to the rate reductions. As described in a TTARA guide to Texas school funding, revised in January 2012, legislators created a tax-relief fund to reimburse districts by drawing on revenue gains from a revised and expanded business franchise tax and increases in state cigarette and tobacco taxes, plus a change in how the state calculates the taxable price of used cars and trucks. According to the guide, some $2.2 billion was to be pulled from the fund in the 2011-12 school year. A May 19, 2006, Austin American-Statesman news article called the expansion of the state\u2019s business tax the \"\"centerpiece\"\" of Perry\u2019s plan to cut school property taxes. As he signed the business-tax measure into law, Perry said: \"\"\"\"Today I am proud to sign into law landmark business tax reforms that will provide greater fairness for employers, reliable funding for our school classrooms and revenue that will help deliver a record $15.7 billion property tax cut for the people of Texas.\"\" The Statesman story continued: \"\"The plan cuts property tax rates for school operations by one-third over two years. It adds $1 per pack to the cigarette tax. The plan will cut more in taxes than it brings in, and it includes $1.5 billion in increased school spending, including $2,000 pay raises for teachers.\"\" Considine stressed to us by email that there was still a net tax decrease thanks to the 2006 actions. The record-breaking part of Dewhurst's blog-post claim rings true. We recalled only one other substantial statewide property-tax break. The 1997 Legislature sent voters a proposed constitutional amendment, subsequently adopted, increasing from $5,000 to $15,000 the residential homestead exemption from school property taxes, a change then estimated to save a typical Texas homeowner about $12 a month, according to a July 1997 report by the House Research Organization. That report also said: \"\"The net result would be one of the largest tax reductions in state history.\"\" By email, school finance expert Joe Wisnoski of Austin offered his ballpark estimate that the 1997 actions have a current-day annual value of about $$650 million to $700 million with the annual value of the 2006 tax-rate actions being far more--at least $6 billion, he said. Finally, we identified no reason to believe Dewhurst didn\u2019t support all the tax-cut proposals passed into law on his watch. He\u2019s a long-time Republican leader in the Republican-steered Capitol. But he didn\u2019t personally cut any taxes. He had no vote on the listed measures--those belonged to senators and House members. On the other hand, his powers include the appointment of pivotal Senate committees, the reference of individual proposals to particular committees and the setting of the Senate's floor agenda. He was a gavel-wielding player. Our ruling Dewhurst said: \"\"I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history.\"\" This statement paints an incomplete picture. About 63 (or 54) measures giving someone a tax break passed into law on Dewhurst\u2019s watch, but it's not like Texans are less tapped by such taxes of late than before.

{"claim_id":"31034","hypothesis":"A major Hepatitis A outbreak in San Diego has been pinned on undocumented immigrants there.","explanation_1":"We have reached out to the San Diego Regional Task Force on the Homeless seeking comment. The group reported in April 2017 that there were 9,116 people locally as \u201cliving in the streets or in shelters,\u201d up 5 percent compared to 2016. Alvarez told us that the task force did not ask for individuals\u2019 immigration status while compiling its data.","premise":"On 3 September 2017, the web site America\u2019s Freedom Fighters published a story that purported to directly link undocumented immigrants in San Diego, California to a local Hepatitis A outbreak: The ultra liberal city of San Diego, California which incidentally is inundated with illegal aliens is facing a health crisis and authorities have declared PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. A public health emergency was declared Friday over an outbreak of \u2018hepatitis A\u2019 that has been linked to at least 15 deaths and 400 hospitalizations. It also closed on a more explicitly anti-immigrant note: These kind of problems are typical in liberal cities. Build the wall. God Bless. San Diego County officials did declare a local health emergency on 31 August 2017 in response to a hepatitis outbreak, but there is no indication whatsoever that it originated or was spread by the city\u2019s local undocumented population. A spokesperson for the county\u2019s Health and Human Services department, Craig Sturak, told us: The primary population being impacted is the homeless and\/or drug-using individuals on the street. I am not aware of any connection to undocumented immigrants. Sturak confirmed to us that 15 people had died in connection to the outbreak as of 29 August 2017. However, he also said that 263 people \u2014 not 400 \u2014 had been hospitalized out of 378 cases. San Diego City Council member Chris Ward, whose district includes the downtown area (which has a high concentration of the local homeless population), told us in a statement: Like local health officials, I have seen no evidence of any connection and would strongly caution against spreading unsubstantiated rumors that serve to undermine our ability to respond to this health crisis effectively. Fellow council member David Alvarez, who has sparred with Mayor Kevin Faulconer regarding the city response to the issue, told us: There\u2019s no validity to this. It\u2019s just individuals who are looking to scapegoat using vulnerable populations, whether it\u2019s our homeless community or our immigrant communities. It\u2019s not surprising in the age of [President Donald] Trump, to be honest. But still shameful. The disease is a liver infection that,\u00a0according to the Centers for Disease Control, is \u201cusually transmitted by the fecal-oral route, either through person-to-person contact or consumption of contaminated food or water.\u201d Following the emergency declaration by public health officer Wilma Wooten, the city began installing hand-washing stations in \u00a0at least thirty locations around the city, including more than a dozen downtown. Street-cleaning crews will also be directed to remove \u201call feces, blood, bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces\u201d with a mix of high-pressure water and bleach. The outbreak was traced back to November 2016, but according to Wooten, vaccination efforts and distribution of hygiene kits did not quell the spread of the infection. Experts reportedly did not gauge the speed of the outbreak until March 2017. Alvarez has called for Faulconer to declare a homeless state of emergency, saying that it would allow the city to bypass some regulations in order to designate some buildings as temporary housing. An advisor for Faulconer, Jonathan Herrera, countered by saying that Faulconer had already done so in 2016 and 2017. On 30 August 2017, the California state assembly\u2019s Joint Committee On Legislative Audit approved a request by state Sen. Ben Hueso (D) to investigate whether the county has employed enough public nurses to deal with the outbreak.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6025}
{"claim_id":"15065","hypothesis":"\"Planned Parenthood has \"\"now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts.\"","explanation_1":"\"Stemberger said Planned Parenthood has \"\"now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts.\"\" Videos from the Center for Medical Progress have led to lots of debate among activists and politicians, but federal law allows for fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating those donations. At any rate, the Florida affiliates are not participating in these types of transactions. Stemberger\u2019s letter makes it sound as if Planned Parenthood had been proven guilty of a crime, which is not accurate. He also made a host of other accusations against the Florida organization for which we can\u2019t find evidence.\"","premise":"\"An Orlando-based conservative Christian group has called on Gov. Rick Scott to choke off all forms of state funding for Planned Parenthood, saying the organization has broken the law and doesn\u2019t deserve taxpayer money. In a letter dated Sept. 22, 2015, Florida Family Policy Council President John Stemberger thanked Scott for investigating state Planned Parenthood affiliates after videos showing officials discussing fetal tissue were released by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress this summer. But Stemberger wanted Scott to go further. Stemberger said because of what the videos show, the group should not get money through the state\u2019s Medicaid program and Title X, a federal grant program for family planning and preventive health services. \"\"No organization with a record of illegal activity and abuse, now found to also illegally sell baby parts and likely altering abortion practices to do so, should receive taxpayer dollars,\"\" Stemberger wrote. (GOP presidential candidate and former Gov. Jeb Bush ended direct state subsidies for the group in 2001.) Planned Parenthood has been subject to hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives because of the videos, but has it been proven the organization broke the law with their fetal tissue donations? The short answer is no, but there\u2019s no shortage of accusations. State investigation To get up to speed, part of a Center for Medical Progress video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling undercover activists that fetal tissue can be obtained for fees in the $30 to $100 range. Activists against abortion rights say this is proof the group has a history of trying to \"\"illegally sell baby parts,\"\" as Stemberger\u2019s letter said. Many critics have argued Planned Parenthood has broken the law. But there has been no legal ruling against the group. The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 allows a woman to consent to donating fetal tissue after an abortion. This tissue then can be donated to researchers, but allows providers to charge vaguely defined \"\"reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.\"\" Planned Parenthood said discussions of payments were only about recouping costs, not making a profit. Experts largely agree that the fees Nucatola describes are within the scope of the law. The videos led to several congressional hearings on how Planned Parenthood uses federal funding. Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated nonprofit organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Funding comes from a wide range of sources, including private donations, grants, health center revenue and Medicaid. State and federal money cannot be used for abortion services. Scott ordered the investigation into 16 Planned Parenthood health centers that provide abortion services and are operated by Florida\u2019s two affiliated chapters. None of the state locations participate in a fetal tissue donation program. The state Agency for Health Care Administration, which ensures health centers comply with state guidelines, cited three clinics for allegedly providing second-trimester abortions without a license, violations Planned Parenthood has denied. A fourth was cited for improper recordkeeping. (Planned Parenthood has sued Florida over the investigation.) None were cited for how they handled fetal tissue. Other allegations Stemberger\u2019s letter makes reference to the result of the Florida investigation, and also mentions a 2008 incident in which Planned Parenthood ended its affiliation with four clinics in Broward County and one in Boca Raton. The chapter running those clinics, formerly known as Planned Parenthood of South Palm Beach and Broward Counties, was mired in harassment complaints and the possible misuse of nearly $450,000, which was just less than the $500,000 it received in taxpayer funding. Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates Executive Director Laura Goodhue said the organization ended its affiliation with that chapter over the mismanagement. The Alliance Defending Freedom, another conservative Christian group that Stemberger said does legal research for the Florida Family Policy Council, included this incident in a report on potential fraud. It\u2019s the only mention of Florida in the report. But Stemberger\u2019s letter goes on to say, \"\"This is merely a short list of the abuses committed by Planned Parenthood in Florida, not including its stunning failure to report sexual abuse of minors, waste, abuse, and potential fraud of taxpayer dollars.\"\" Stemberger told PolitiFact Florida that he was referring in part to accusations that clinics in other states had failed to report sexual abuse. Alliance Defending Freedom tracks abuse accusations in Arizona, Colorado, Ohio and other places. Accusations of not reporting sexual abuse also are a subject of sting videos by another group called Live Action. Planned Parenthood maintains its policy is to report all suspected instances of sexual abuse. While we found no concrete evidence of similar accusations in Florida, Stemberger said Planned Parenthood as a whole was still culpable. \"\"If none of these violations occurred in Florida, it still holds true,\"\" he said. \"\"There\u2019s a commonality of practice here that ties the two together.\"\" Both Scott\u2019s office and Planned Parenthood have disagreed with Stemberger\u2019s assertion that the governor could end state funding through Medicaid and Title X, saying it would be a violation of federal law. The state said about $45,000 in matching funds goes to Planned Parenthood through Medicaid, and three clinics have contracts for newborn health screening and other services. The clinics have to comply with state and federal laws. Stemberger maintained funding can be pulled if Planned Parenthood no longer qualifies as a provider. Scott\u2019s response to Stemberger\u2019s letter reiterated his disdain for Planned Parenthood, but didn\u2019t offer more detail. \"\"We took aggressive, immediate action to investigate Planned Parenthood offices in Florida when the horrific videos were released,\"\" Scott said in a statement in response to the letter. \"\"When we found that some of their facilities were not complying with state law, we held them accountable.\"\" As for Stemberger\u2019s assertion of other wrongdoing, Goodhue said she didn\u2019t have records of any other investigations besides inquiries this summer. \"\"We\u2019re heavily regulated. AHCA can investigate us at any time,\"\" she said. Our ruling Stemberger said Planned Parenthood has \"\"now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts.\"\" Videos from the Center for Medical Progress have led to lots of debate among activists and politicians, but federal law allows for fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating those donations. At any rate, the Florida affiliates are not participating in these types of transactions. Stemberger\u2019s letter makes it sound as if Planned Parenthood had been proven guilty of a crime, which is not accurate. He also made a host of other accusations against the Florida organization for which we can\u2019t find evidence.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":4816}
{"claim_id":"26106","hypothesis":"\u201cIf we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.\u201d","explanation_1":"The swelling pandemic requires a more aggressive response than the White House has so far outlined. Halting testing wouldn\u2019t eliminate COVID-19 cases. It would conceal them and could fuel an even greater crisis.","premise":"\"President Donald Trump sought to downplay the numbers associated with COVID-19 in the United States \u2014 which have passed 2 million confirmed cases and are nearing 120,000 lives lost \u2014 by arguing that the soaring national count was simply the result of superior testing. \"\"If you don't test, you don't have any cases,\"\" Trump said at a June 15 roundtable discussion at the White House. \"\"If we stopped testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any.\"\" It\u2019s a talking point the administration is emphasizing. Vice President Mike Pence reiterated it during a phone call to Republican governors that evening, recommending they use the argument as a strategy to quiet public concern about surging case tallies in some states. It\u2019s also a variation on a tweet the president sent earlier in the day. With that in mind, we wanted to dig deeper. We reached out to the White House for comment or clarification, but we never heard back. Independent researchers told us, though, that the president\u2019s remarks are not only misleading \u2014 they\u2019re also counterproductive in terms of thinking through what\u2019s needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Essentially, the president is arguing that the United States is finding more cases of COVID-19 because we are testing more \u2013 and our increased testing makes it look like we have a worse epidemic than other countries do. \"\"We will show more \u2014 more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do; they just don\u2019t talk about it,\"\" he added. But that isn\u2019t true. The numbers paint a stark picture. The United States has recorded 2.1 million cases of the novel virus so far, about a quarter of the global total and more than any other country. To Trump\u2019s point, the country is testing more now than it did at the start of the outbreak \u2014 per capita, the U.S. is in the top 20% of countries when it comes to cumulative tests run. But this beefed up testing is still likely undercounting. The problem is that the U.S. outbreak is worse than that of many other countries \u2013 so we need to be testing a higher percentage of our population than do others. A way to understand this: the number of tests necessary to identify a positive case. If it\u2019s easier to find a positive case, that suggests the virus has spread further and more testing is necessary to track the spread of COVID-19. For instance, statistics from the United States and the United Kingdom are fairly similar in terms of how many coronavirus tests are done daily per million people. But those tests yield far more positive cases in the United States. That suggests the outbreak here requires more per-capita testing than does the U.K.\u2019s. \"\"We have a much bigger epidemic, so you have to test more proportionately,\"\" said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Put another way, a larger health crisis means \u2014 even after controlling for population size \u2014 the United States will have to test more people to find out where and how the virus has spread. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) And while the U.S. has ramped up its testing since March, many parts of the country still don\u2019t have sufficient systems in place \u2014 from facilities to staff to medical supplies \u2014 for diagnosing COVID-19, researchers told us. And what about the president\u2019s assertion that \"\"if we stopped testing right now, we\u2019d have very few cases\"\" or none at all? On its literal phrasing, it\u2019s absurd, experts said. \"\"The implication that not testing makes the problem go away is completely false. It could not be more false,\"\" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. That\u2019s because testing doesn\u2019t create instances of the virus \u2014 it is just a way of showing and tracking them. (The president made a similar point during the same White House roundtable event.) But even if you take it figuratively \u2013 the idea that our expanded testing resources have inflated our sense of the epidemic \u2013 it\u2019s still misleading. \"\"We\u2019re seeing a lot of cases because we\u2019re testing? It just doesn\u2019t ring true,\"\" Kates said. \"\"The U.S. has made a lot of progress for sure. But that job is not finished.\"\" The president\u2019s claim is part of a larger re-election strategy, argued Robert Blendon, a health care pollster at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The idea is to suggest that the health crisis is mostly exaggerated \u2013 and that things are getting better, and Americans should feel comfortable going back to work. \"\"If the economy takes off, the president has a chance of re-election,\"\" Blendon said. \"\"If it contracts as a result of expansion of cases, and the only way we know how to respond is restriction of economic activity, he\u2019s gone.\"\" But the problem, Blendon added, is that COVID-19 counts are still climbing in multiple states. And people are still dying of the virus. That gets at another point: Diagnostic testing isn\u2019t the only data source to reveal the pandemic\u2019s existence. Let\u2019s not forget about hospitalization rates and death counts. The number of deaths continues to rise, and hospitalizations are higher than they would be in the virus\u2019s absence. Trump argued that the nation\u2019s high count of COVID-19 cases is simply a result of our expanded testing capacity. His point is entirely incorrect. The most relevant data suggests that the U.S. isn\u2019t testing enough to match the severity of the pandemic. Even with our higher testing ratio, we\u2019re probably still undercounting compared to other countries. Testing doesn\u2019t create the virus. Even without diagnostics, COVID-19 would still pose a problem. We just would know less about it. And in fact, eliminating testing may alter the public\u2019s perception of the pandemic, but it wouldn\u2019t conceal it. If anything, it would likely worsen the crisis, since the public health system wouldn\u2019t know how to accurately track and prevent the spread of the virus. The claim has no merit and seriously misrepresents the severity of the public health crisis.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":7523}
{"claim_id":"10311","hypothesis":"Oxygen Therapy May Relieve Cluster Headache Pain","explanation_1":"Unfortunately, the HealthDay story on this promising research is essentially the JAMA press release, only shorter. The quotes are taken directly from the press release. No new sources\u2019 perspectives were included in the story. If the reporter read the journal article or even the abstract, there is no evidence of it. Like the press release, the story relays the major take-home points of the journal article. The hazards or reporting-by-press-release are obvious, the most glaring being that there\u2019s no way to verify that the press release has described the research accurately. To be fair, if that is necessary, a note at the end of the story should disclose that its source is the press release rather than the journal article. The pain of cluster headaches can be overwhelming, and an effective medication is already in wide use. Not everyone can use the medicine because of side effects or existing medical problems. This study tests whether breathing 100% oxygen can shorten the headaches\u2019 duration. A treatment like this with few side effects would be a big help to these headache sufferers. But the story apparently didn\u2019t include any independent reporting to scrutinize the evidence.","premise":"\"The story fails to mention costs for either oxygen treatment or the conventional treatment, an injection with sumatriptan. The story outlines the most basic outcomes\u2013that 78 percent of patients receiving oxygen reported relief at 15 minutes, and that pain relief was better than placebo at 30 and 60 minutes. Still, both the study and the article fail to address longer-term benefits or harms. The story cites the researchers\u2019 claim that there were no adverse effects to the oxygen treatment. Both the study and the article fail to address potential future harms, and this should have been discussed. The story barely receives a \"\"satisfactory\"\" rating under this criterion. This is one area where an independent perspective would have been helpful. The story both overstates and understates the quality of the evidence. While the story mentioned how many people were in the trial, It fails to point out the limitations of drawing conclusions when the study size was so small [particularly in the \"\"chronic\"\" patient category]. Yet it fails to mention that it was a double-blind crossover study, which gives it more methodological integrity. There isn\u2019t any disease mongering in the story, but there also isn\u2019t any information provided about the prevalence of cluster headaches, nor of the proportion of all headaches that they represent. The reader therefore may have a hard time identifying the importance or applicability of this treatment. No independent sources were cited in the story. The story fails to compare pain relief from the standard drug treatment with that of high-flow oxygen. The study itself failed to do this, but a diligent reporter would have dug to find outcomes data on the drug treatment. The story says high-flow oxygen is in \"\"limited use\"\" to treat cluster headaches. But it fails to say where or how it is available \u2013 or even what \"\"limited\"\" really means. Two places in the US? Twenty? The story does a decent job explaining that high-flow oxygen is in scattered clinical use, and that this study provides some validation of a current practice. The story appears to depend solely on the Journal of the American Medical Association press release. It uses the same quotes in their entirety. All facts in the story also appear in the press release. If the reporter did any independent research there is no evidence of it.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":7061}
{"claim_id":"35914","hypothesis":"The reason the U.S. documented the most COVID-19 cases in the world in 2020 was because it had tested more residents at a faster rate than any other country.","explanation_1":"Yes I am aware that testing turns up more cases. That is indeed the point. But in many of the states experiencing a resurgence, hospitalizations are up and the percent of tests that are positive is rising. Those are signs of trouble. [\u2026] It\u2019s not just testing.","premise":"Since the early months of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump alleged a scheme by his opponents and journalists to purposefully ignore his administration\u2019s success with testing Americans for the potentially deadly virus and curbing its spread. On April 25, for example, Trump tweeted the U.S. had conducted \u201cfar more [tests] than any other country in the world\u201d and suggested that news reporters were purposefully keeping that achievement quiet to undermine his office\u2019s work to combat the pandemic. Then, less than two weeks later, the president again made the claim while retweeting a graph that depicted the number of COVID-19 tests performed in Japan, South Korea, France, Canada, Italy, Germany, and the U.S., with the caption: \u201c[Here] is the newest chart on our great testing \u2018miracle\u2019 compared to other countries.\u201d  He doubled down on the alleged conspiracy as the pandemic worsened. The president claimed that not only was the U.S. testing for the virus better than other countries, but also America\u2019s skyrocketing case numbers were a direct result of the rate of testing \u2014 not the fact that more Americans were passing the virus to one another. For example, after a July 31 congressional hearing in which Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, asked national public health leaders why Europe had largely contained the virus while the U.S. had not, Trump claimed such comparisons were erroneous because \u201cwe do MUCH MORE testing\u201d than anywhere else. The theory spurred a wave of viral posts (like the one displayed below) from Trump\u2019s followers and other politicians, all with the same underlying assertion: that the U.S. tallied the highest number of COVID-19 cases globally for one reason: It had tested more residents at a faster rate than any other country. But, as we\u2019ll show below, that argument is flawed because it misunderstands \u2014 or purposefully overlooks \u2014 the evidence epidemiologists use to measure whether people were indeed stopping the spread of the virus to new people or communities. To begin our analysis, we first considered whether the country had tallied the most coronavirus cases globally, and whether it had tested more residents at a faster rate than anywhere else. For the former point, Snopes referred to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University that showed the U.S. case load surpassed all other countries\u2019 individual totals beginning in late March (about two months after the first U.S. COVID-19 report), with more than 82,400 confirmed cases at that time. Simultaneously, China, the pandemic\u2019s epicenter, recorded about 81,700. After that, the number of U.S. cases increased and the nation maintained its status as the country with the most coronavirus cases, confirming the basis to the claim. As of this report, the country has documented more than 6.9 million cases, topping India with roughly 5.6 million cases and Brazil with about 4.6 million. (Note: Per every one million people, Brazil had roughly 22,000 cases \u2014 the highest per capita case load globally \u2014 while the U.S. ranked second by that standard with about 21,000 cases, according to an analysis of global data by a Nova School of Business & Economics researcher.) Next, we considered whether it was true that America had tested more residents for the coronavirus than any other country since the start of the pandemic. According to testing statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins, yes, the U.S. had conducted more tests per capita than any other nation, with a seven-day average of 263 tests per 100,000 Americans, as of late September. That statistic, however, did not consider the size of the outbreaks country-by-country but only measured raw testing numbers per population size. The Johns Hopkins database included the following caveat, as of Sept. 23: In order for governments to identify new cases and effectively respond to the pandemic through tracing and treatment, testing programs should be scaled to the size of their epidemic, not the size of the population. [\u2026] [Several] countries effectively controlled the spread of the virus through testing programs that had a far lower number of tests per capita than the U.S. Meanwhile, despite having the highest rate of tests per capita, the U.S. faces the largest outbreak in the world and new cases continue to trend upwards in many states. Looking at the positivity rate (ie, out of all tests conducted, how many came back positive for COVID-19) is the most reliable way to determine if a government is testing enough. A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net. Without question, increased testing would reveal more positive cases \u2014 that\u2019s the nature of probability. However, the president\u2019s claim that there is an \u201cx\u201d equals \u201cy\u201d relationship between testing and total cases was misleading and potentially discouraged people from taking the responsibility to make lifestyle changes that would further contain the virus. First, let us consider the comparison made in above-displayed meme. By giving more people IQ tests, you would not necessarily see an increase in the share of test-takers with low scores. You would likely notice roughly the same results on average if no other conditions, besides more people taking the tests, changed. But if you adjusted for how many people completed the test or how much time they had to finish it \u2014 while simultaneously giving out tests to more people \u2014 you may see different results overall. In other words, other factors were at play in the growth of U.S. COVID-19 case numbers, though they were not acknowledged in Trump\u2019s tweets. For his claim to be true \u2014 that expanded testing was the sole reason for increasing COVID-19 cases in America \u2014 the virus would not be spreading to new people or communities, and the proportion of positive tests (within the sum of tests) would decrease, or remain steady, over time. But according to our analysis of testing data and daily COVID-19 cases, that was not the case. We\u2019ll show you the numbers: In early June, the country was administering an average of about 417,000 tests daily, according to The COVID Tracking Project. Also at that time, about 5.2 tests out of every 100 came back positive, which meant the U.S. tallied about 20,000 new cases each day, per the Johns Hopkins data. Comparatively, in early September, the U.S. was conducting an average of roughly 760,000 tests daily \u2014 which is more than 180% higher than in June, the data showed. But about 5.7% of tests were positive, totaling about 42,000 new cases daily. As you can see, yes, testing had become available to more Americans over time. But the share of people who tested positive for the virus at times increased \u2014 it did not decrease or remain consistent in conjunction with the increased access to testing. \u201cThe fact that the test positivity rate is increasing (in the U.S.) while we\u2019re increasing the number of tests is extremely strong evidence that the surge in cases is real,\u201d Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins, told USA Today, in July. A similar trend \u2014 rising positivity rates amid expanded testing \u2014 appeared in examinations of state-level data, too. For example, Florida documented a positivity rate of about 2.6% in early June and more than 12% in early September. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s rate of testing at times grew, but at a pace slower than the positivity rate. Furthermore, a state-by-state analysis in late July by STAT, a news outlet for science stories, found the rate of disease outpaced the expansion of testing in 26 states. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that extremely sick people, let alone dead people, had been obscured by low levels of testing but suddenly revealed by higher levels,\u201d the report stated. Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins, made that point in a series of tweets\u00a0about a month earlier, writing:","label":2,"__index_level_0__":8578}

The show's writers didn't so much \"\"predict\"\" such campaigns, as satirize previous ones, which happened to be replicated in the years since the episode aired.\"","premise":"Several times in recent years, various websites and online \u201clisticles\u201d have claimed that, among other uncanny predictions, the Simpsons once pre-empted the real-life censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d statue. In particular, in 2017 the comedian and former NFL punter Pat McAfee devoted a five-minute segment on his podcast to reviewing and promoting various claimed instances where the classic animated sitcom was remarkably prescient about events that were yet to happen. He said: \u201cThe censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s David: 1990 [it occurred on the show], 2016 it happened.\u201d Likewise, in a 2018 article listing more than 30 occasions when \u201creal life has imitated \u2018The Simpsons,'\u201d the Daily Telegraph wrote: Itchy and Scratchy also featured heavily in the 1990 episode Itchy and Scratchy and Marge, in which Marge led a censorship campaign, horrified by the show\u2019s violence. She later realised the censorship had gone too far, after Michelangelo\u2019s David was taken to a Springfield museum, and local citizens protested against the statue\u2019s nudity. In 2001, a Florida-based shop put a replica of Michelangelo\u2019s David outside its front door. A handful of citizens objected to the \u201cindecent\u201d statue and successfully campaigned to have David\u2019s private parts covered with a cloth. More recently, in 2014, an elderly British couple, Clive and Joan Burgess, received complaints from neighbours and faced an intervention from their local council, after they placed a replica of the statue in their front garden. In May 2019, Business Insider published a list of \u201c18 Times \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Accurately Predicted the Future,\u201d including the bowdlerization of \u201cDavid\u201d: \u201cAn episode from 1990 titled \u2018Itchy and Scratchy and Marge\u2019 showed Springfieldians protesting against Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David being exhibited in the local museum, calling the artwork obscene for its nudity. The satire of censorship came true in July 2016, when Russian campaigners voted on whether to clothe a copy of the Renaissance statue that had been set up in central St. Petersburg.\u201d The basic facts, dates, and descriptions of events laid out in these articles and in McAfee\u2019s podcast were accurate. The episode in question was Season 2, Episode 9, \u201cItchy and Scratchy and Marge,\u201d and it did indeed first air on Dec. 20, 1990. In the episode, Marge rails against the ultra-violence and obscenity of the \u201cItchy and Scratchy Show,\u201d and leads a campaign of censorship against the cartoon. The writers brilliantly examine and expose the relativity and subjectivity of taste, obscenity, and moral standards in culture, and Marge\u2019s crusade spirals out of control, culminating in a local group picketing Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d for its nudity. It\u2019s also true that, as McAfee alluded to, a campaign took place in the Russian city of St. Petersburg in 2016 that aimed to remove a replica of the statue, or cover up the male figure\u2019s genitals \u2014 not a far cry from the kind of campaign depicted in the 1990 \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode. However, the difficulty in claiming that Matt Groening and his writers \u201cpredicted\u201d the censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d lies in the fact that campaigns to cover up nude works of art in general, and \u201cDavid\u201d in particular, have existed for centuries. The prevalence of fig leafs on classical statues is testament to that, as Alexxa Gotthardt wrote for the website Artsy in 2018: Take Michelangelo\u2019s famous sculpture \u201cDavid\u201d (1501\u201304), a muscular, starkly naked depiction of its namesake biblical hero. The work scandalized the artist\u2019s fellow Florentines and the Catholic clergy when unveiled in Florence\u2019s Piazza della Signoria in 1504.

The term \u201cnootropics\u201d applies to a wide variety of substances that apparently require no safety or efficacy trials, no FDA approval, and no prescription from a doctor. As a result, media coverage is often consumers\u2019 only tool to counter the marketing hype when attempting to determine whether these products will do them good or harm, or simply waste their money. Sadly critical coverage is in short supply.

Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said. This story falls into the trap of relying on positive anecdotes as evidence, citing an entrepreneur who \u201ccredits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees,\u201d as well as a physician who said he with experimented with piracetam and found it \u201chelpful.\u201d Also troublesome is this statement: \u201cPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities.\u201d\u00a0 Saying it\u2019s \u201cwell studied\u201d in the same sentence as giving purported benefits is confusing and may lead readers to assume incorrectly that these benefits were proven in studies. Lastly, the story quotes advocates of fasting without cautioning that what works in mice may not apply to humans. Comments Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging: \u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases.\u201d In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cconclusive evidence from animal studies.\u201d To its credit, the story does eventually\u2013but very briefly\u2013explore the quality of the evidence, mainly via\u00a0this comment from Duke University Health System researcher Murali Doraiswamy: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence.\u201d There\u2019s no outright disease-mongering here, but the preposterous quote that it is \u201cthe few who are getting ahead who are using supplements\u201d should have been challenged. That makes it sounds like \u201cnormal\u201d people are in some way deficient. The story lacks comment from an independent expert who\u2019s not involved with selling, prescribing or taking nootropics or some other cognition-boosting product. The story doesn\u2019t address proven strategies to improve mental skills such as good nutrition, adequate sleep, social engagement, cognitively challenging activities, and exercise. The story does a good job here, although it injects confusion when it states that in the U.S. piracetam \u201ccan be sold only for research purposes,\u201d but later says that piracetam and similar drugs are available online. In fact, the FDA at least twice warned suppliers, in 2010 and 2012, that piracetam was classified as a drug and could not be sold as a supplement. According to online accounts, that FDA action prompted major retailers to stop carrying it, which could explain why it\u2019s not present in some products marketed as nootropics. The story also states: \u201cA number of companies now market nootropic \u2018stacks,\u2019 or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\u201d There story gives perspective, mentioning that piracetam has been around for decades, though newer formulations are on the market, and that companies have recently begun marketing \u201cstacks\u201d with multiple supplements. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":5579}
{"claim_id":"9595","hypothesis":"Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers","explanation_1":"Reducing sugar\u2014but not calories\u2014in the diets of a small group of children who have obesity led to substantial reductions in heart disease risk factors in only nine days, a new study shows. This brief New York Times Well blog post does a good\u00a0job explaining these details, including the cautionary information that the study was small and of short duration. But the cost of brevity is\u00a0that it fails\u00a0to offer readers the kinds of methodological and explanatory details that would have helped them judge the relatively cursory nature of the research. Instead, it encourages readers to view the study as part of a growing body of research by referring them to a longer and more detailed 2015 post about a study conducted by some of the same scientists. Alas, a quick look at the methodological details suggests that both studies stem from the same group of child participants. It is not unusual for a single study to generate several research articles. But one could make the argument here that holding such small studies in abeyance and waiting for the bigger picture would serve readers better. Including commentary from an independent expert also would have strengthened the post. Although we Americans cling desperately to our sugary foods, learning that reducing sugar could markedly improve our health might encourage significant behavior change in this country. There is a growing\u2013but certainly not\u00a0conclusive\u2013body of evidence that suggests there might be unique concerns with sugar beyond just its calories, such as being a possible contributor to heart disease.","premise":"The brief text reflects only on removing highly sugared foods\u00a0in the diet of children. Replacement foods used in the study were commonly available at no obvious extra cost. This short narrative does an admirable job of getting specific about physiological changes that took place in these children over the course\u00a0of nine days. However, the story should have\u00a0established what this means in terms of an outcome that someone cares about. What would be the expected reduction in risk of heart attack or stroke? How big are the changes clinically, and how do they compare with other approaches? It\u2019s probably hard to say since these are children, but then the story should acknowledge that. The study sought to hold number of calories constant in order to examine the impact of reduced sugar. While many health experts would point out that substituting pizza and bagels does not meet the criteria for an overall healthy diet, that was not a concern of this design. This was a modest study, with only 37 or 43 (the blog post indicates 37 while a UCSF\u00a0news\u00a0release indicates 43) child participants who were tracked over nine days. The reporter does label the effort \u201csmall and short-term.\u201d Calls to reduce sugar in our diets have burgeoned in recent years, and data do seem to suggest that eating less sugar is beneficial. Just how beneficial is still a matter of study. There are no independent sources\u2013the one person quoted\u00a0is study coauthor, Dr. Robert Lustig, who has a potential conflict of interest. Lustig wrote a book that\u2019s extremely critical of sugar, and has spoken of fructose as \u201cpoison.\u201d The story makes no mention of other strategies typically employed to reduce markers of heart disease, including other types of dietary changes, exercise and drugs such as statins (which are typically reserved for adults). The UCSF\u00a0news\u00a0release did include this type of information. Bagels and pizza are ubiquitous. The extent to which the research is novel is left unexplored. The blog post does reference a 2015 post about a research report that, while examining different physiological end points, reaches similar conclusions about sugar as a bad actor. The UCSF news\u00a0release provided a lot of information about this study, but the blog post\u00a0sticks with\u00a0a short summary of the\u00a0findings. The one quote in the story appears to be original, and not taken from the news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":3566}
{"claim_id":"9525","hypothesis":"Cuddling Preemies Kangaroo Style Helps Into Adulthood","explanation_1":"This story reports on a 20-year follow-up study of low birth weight infants in Colombia who received continuous skin-to-skin contact with a caregiver as part of a practice known as kangaroo mother care (KMC). Researchers concluded that infants who had been randomized to receive KMC rather than staying in an incubator reaped long-lasting social and behavioral benefits such as lower mortality, lower school absenteeism and fewer behavior problems. This coverage describes both positive and negative findings of the 20-year outcomes,\u00a0which were reported in the journal Pediatrics, but it doesn\u2019t include quantified data or tap independent sources. It also misses important limitations, such as the difficulty of measuring the precise impact of a multi-faceted intervention after 20 years have gone by. It seems odd to label as an \u201cintervention\u201d something as natural as skin-to-skin contact between a mother and a baby, along with an emphasis on breastfeeding and early hospital discharge. KMC was developed in the 1970s in Bogat\u00e1, Colombia, partly in response to overtaxed neonatal care facilities. But its many demonstrated benefits \u2014 including lower mortality and infection rates, greater breastfeeding and stronger family bonding \u2014 have pushed those concepts into mainstream preemie care in countries of all income levels. The World Health Organization includes KMC in its guidelines to improve premature birth outcomes. Some 15 million babies are born too early every year, leading to nearly 1 million deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. Survivors are prone to learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. The vast majority of these at-risk infants are in developing countries where medical resources are limited. Despite some flaws, this study offers reassurance that premature babies who spend their early days with skin-to-skin will fare at least as well as adults as those who were in an incubator. Stories should not extrapolate beyond that.","premise":"The costs of this intervention or of the control, a neonatal minimal care unit in which infants remain in an incubator while they gain weight, aren\u2019t mentioned. The story states that KMC babies were 39 percent more likely to live into adulthood, but doesn\u2019t give absolute numbers to help readers judge the significance of this finding. The story also lists several other benefits without quantifying them (or even explaining what they mean in some cases), including that the babies \u201cgrew up with fewer social problems,\u201d stayed in school longer and earned more as adults. It quotes a researcher saying they \u201chad less aggressive drive and were less impulsive and hyperactive\u201d compared to babies who stayed in an incubator.\u201d There aren\u2019t any obvious harms from this intervention, although the story does note the finding that children given standard incubator care had higher math and language scores in school even though IQ levels were similar in both groups. A 2012 Cochrane review of multiple studies found no negative outcomes associated with skin-to-skin contact for healthy newborns except for one study\u2019s report of longer duration of breastfeeding in a control group. The story acknowledges KMC \u201cdidn\u2019t work miracles. Children with cerebral palsy were equally likely to have symptoms whether they had the kangaroo care or not, and more than half the people in the entire group needed glasses.\u201d But, the story should have made the point that it\u2019s difficult to connect the dots between a single intervention and outcomes 20 years down the road. In an editorial accompanying the study, Lydia Furman, MD, of University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, describes several complications with the findings. For one, she notes, KMC is a \u201cbundled intervention\u201d involving parental nurturing, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin contact, making it difficult to discern which contributed to the outcomes. She writes: Second, it is difficult to quantify and qualify parent-associated and parent-delivered interventions because all parents are different. Third, we are a full 20 years out, and \u201clife has happened,\u201d so numerous potentially unmeasured contributions to each individual child\u2019s life (and outcomes) have occurred. Furman notes that the study shows that KMC infants had some superior outcomes. \u201cYet the authors are pressed to explain the significantly higher math and language academic scores in the traditional care group. In other words, it is complicated.\u201d The story accurately states that 20 million babies are born at a low birth weight every year, according to the World Health Organization. We did take issue with this speculative quote about the behavior of the babies in the skin-to-skin group, which was featured prominently in all caps in the NBC story: \u201cTHEY EXHIBITED LESS ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR, WHICH MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH SEPARATION FROM THE MOTHER AT BIRTH.\u201d This borders on fear-mongering. For all mothers\u2013but especially moms who have premature babies and\/or complicated births\u2013having a newborn is very stressful. The looming threat that antisocial behavior is a risk the mother is specifically responsible for in these fragile days and hours may compound the\u00a0stress. The story lacked comment from independent sources. While there are some statements about KMC attributed to the World Health Organization, those statements don\u2019t address the findings of this study. An independent source likely could have provided some context and important reassurances to parents who had premature babies but either weren\u2019t offered kangaroo care or weren\u2019t able to because of birth complications, which is a growing problem in the U.S. The purpose of the study was to compare the KMC approach with a neonatal intensive care. There are no other viable alternatives to infant care that we know of. The story notes that KMC requires parents to receive adequate support and follow-up. But we would have liked to see more information, such as how widely this approach is used to treat premature infants and what some of the barriers might be in high-income countries where incubator care has been the norm. For example, how many U.S. neonatal intensive care units incorporate skin-to-skin contact in their care? Which babies in intensive care don\u2019t or can\u2019t get this kind of care? From what we could find, what makes this study notable is that it\u2019s the only 20-year follow-up for this kind of intervention. In an indirect way, the story touches upon this. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":9353}

How do you lengthen the life of your prized jack-o-lantern to keep it from shriveling up before Halloween? Try these tips using household products you already have \u2026That was a ratio of one part bleach to 65 parts water, as one quart contains\u00a065 tablespoons.ApartmentTherapy.com\u2019s instructions were slightly more involved than those presented in the Facebook post, and the site recommended ongoing pumpkin bleach baths for carved pumpkin maintenance. Also, the ratio was even smaller than one part bleach to ten parts water, recommending a tablespoon of bleach for a gallon of water \u2014 although there were 65 tablespoons in a quart, there are\u00a0256 tablespoons in a gallon.The site advised soaking pumpkins in bleach prior to carving for ten minutes or longer:With your pumpkin still intact, find a bucket or vessel a bit bigger than your gourd. With the pumpkin inside, fill the bucket the rest of the way with a mixture of bleach and water (around 1 to 2 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water). Let the pumpkin soak for 10 minutes or more, moving the floating pumpkin around as needed. After the bleach bath, make sure to let your pumpkin dry completely before digging in with your carving knife.If you\u2019re not carving your pumpkin, she\u2019s good to go! Put her on the porch and enjoy the spooky season.But if you are carving\u2026 save that bleach water!For carved pumpkins, ApartmentTherapy.com advised reserving the \u201cbleach bath\u201d solution in an empty spray bottle, spraying the carved pumpkin after carving, and then re-spraying \u201cevery few days\u201d to extend its life:You can use the same bleach water from your pre-carve bath, or make a fresh mixture with the same ratio (around 1 to 2 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water), but this time, you\u2019ll want to use it to fill a spray bottle.

Dilute one tablespoon of bleach in four cups of water in a large bucket, then soak the pumpkin in the bleach solution for 20 minutes before removing and drying the pumpkin. If you decorated your uncarved pumpkin, skip the soaking and enlist a can of bleach-based spray to spray the entire surface of the pumpkin before letting it dry.BobVila.com used the same ratio Today.com provided, but specified \u201cfour cups,\u201d or one quart. The site further advised at least twenty minutes of a bleach bath to \u201cscare off\u201d enterprising bacteria and fungi.Clorox Clarifies the Pumpkin Bleach Bath ControversyA May 2015\u00a0page on Clorox.com ( \u201cHow to Preserve a Carved Pumpkin,\u201d under Home > How To > Hacks Crafts DIY >\u00a0Surprising Uses For Clorox) addressed the use of bleach to extend the life of pumpkins.

It covered the same topic and was headlined \u201cPreserving Your Halloween Jack o\u2019 Lanterns.\u201dBoth pages contained the same ratios and roughly identical language, explaining that the tip was an extension of similar advice they offered for extending the lives of cut flowers:Lots of people know Clorox\u00ae Regular Bleach2 can be used to help cut flowers stay beautiful longer, but may not know that the same bleach solution can also help keep a jack o\u2019 lantern from getting fuzzy mold and black mildew inside. It\u2019s super easy! If you\u2019d like to try this, here\u2019s how! [\u2026]The ratio offered by the bleach brand was even lower than ApartmentTherapy.com\u2019s ratio of a tablespoon of bleach to a gallon of water. Clorox advised using three teaspoons (or one tablespoon) of standard (not concentrated) bleach to three gallons of water, or one teaspoon per gallon.Clorox\u2019s recommendation was the most dilute; the Facebook post recommended one part bleach to ten parts water, while Clorox recommended one part bleach to 768 parts water. Although the 2016 post did not address wildlife safety, the 2015 post included the following portion about whether hungry animals were placed at risk by the pumpkin bleach bath:Don\u2019t worry about bleach hurting squirrels or other curious critters who might take a nibble of your treated pumpkin. During normal household use, bleach breaks down primarily into salt and water. So after using Clorox\u00ae Bleach as directed on your pumpkins, the diluted bleach solution will break down to table salt and water when it\u2019s exposed to the air and sun. The pumpkin will just taste a bit saltier than the squirrels were expecting!Nevertheless, Clorox recommended a far smaller ratio of bleach to water for carved pumpkins. The ratio of bleach in the Facebook post was 77 times higher than the dilution Clorox advised.Bleach, Food Science, and Pet SafetyA PDF published by food scientists at the University of Oklahoma issued guidelines regarding the safe use of \u201cchlorine bleach for sanitizing raw fruits and vegetables,\u201d\u00a0writing:Presumably, the fresh water rinse eliminates any potential problem with residual chlorine. As a practical matter, residual chlorine would in most foods produce highly objectionable flavors and odors well before becoming a safety hazard. Food processing in-plant chlorination systems typically produce water for processing with residual available chlorine levels of no more than 0.5 ppm. For container cooling or general washing, residual available chlorine levels of 2 to 7 ppm are commonly used. Typical municipal water systems produce potable water with a residual available chlorine level of 0.25 to 2 ppm.Per the guidance, \u201cresidual\u201d bleach would \u2014 for humans \u2014 produce an unpleasant flavor or scent before reaching levels of poisoning risk; diluted bleach is used in food processing at low levels. That said, a number of veterinary advice pages address accidental bleach ingestion in pets and suggest that animals do not always avoid eating objects contaminated with it.A 2008 toxicology brief about bleach and dogs notes that calculating a precise safe level of diluted bleach is difficult, but extrapolates a rough amount from known levels of human toxicity. That report involved two dogs which were euthanized after consuming undiluted bleach:While a lethal dose of sodium hypochlorite in dogs is not established in the veterinary literature, extrapolation from a reported lethal dose of sodium chloride of 3.7 g\/kg in dogs may be considered. For example, a 40-lb (18-kg) dog would have to ingest about 67 g of sodium chloride to attain this lethal dose. The consumption of 1 L of 6.15% sodium hypochlorite bleach containing 19.1 mg\/ml of sodium and 30 mg\/ml of chloride would equal the ingestion of 49.1 g of sodium chloride. Assuming the animals only ingested several hundred milliliters of bleach, this amount would not have been sufficient to attain the lethal dose of sodium chloride. However, corrosive injury to the gastrointestinal tract and the development of other metabolic derangements and secondary complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, likely contributed to the severity of the toxicosis. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that ingestion of at least several hundred milliliters of bleach resulted in the severe morbidity of these dogs, which led to their euthanasia.Researchers deduced a lethal dose of 67 grams for a dog weighing roughly 40 lbs. ; one teaspoon is equivalent to about 4.2 grams, and a tablespoon contains about 14.6 grams. Although most of the concentrations mentioned above diluted the nearly 15 grams of a tablespoon in either a quart or a gallon, the Facebook post advised one part of bleach to ten parts of water.Clorox also featured a March 2018 page about pet-safe uses of Clorox bleach, and noting that bleach can serve as \u201ca simple and inexpensive way to help prevent the spread of parvo and other viruses.\u201d That recommended a slightly stronger dilution for disinfecting toys and crates:Use Clorox\u00ae Regular-Bleach to disinfect hard, nonporous surfaces and accessories like crates and toys on a regular basis. You can use a solution of \u00bd cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water. To kill parvo, soak the items in the solution for 10 minutes, then rinse and air dry.That solution of half a cup of bleach to a gallon of water was stronger than the pumpkin solution Clorox recommended (a teaspoon per gallon), as there were 32 half cups in a gallon. Therefore, the recommended ratio for pet cleaning was one part bleach to 32 parts of water.SummaryA viral Facebook post was correct in indicating that a \u201cbleach bath\u201d could preserve pumpkins, but its ratio of one part of bleach to ten parts water was far stronger than the ratio recommended by Clorox, on a page designed to sell more bleach.

{"claim_id":"13305","hypothesis":"Sen. (Richard) Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.","explanation_1":"\"Ross\u2019 ad said Burr \"\"voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.\"\" Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the law\u2019s reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, the\u00a0ad ignores that\u00a0three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law.\"","premise":"\"In a recent campaign ad, North Carolina Democrat Deborah Ross blasted her opponent, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, for voting against the landmark Violence Against Women Act. \"\"Sen. Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act,\"\" a narrator says in the ad, while the text, \"\"Richard Burr: Opposed Violence Against Women Act,\"\" appears on the screen, along with a citation for a bill considered in the Senate in 2012. Here\u2019s a screenshot from the ad:  Is Ross\u2019 ad correct? In part, but it it leaves out important context. What was Burr voting for? First, we should note that the ad used some loose language about what Burr was actually voting on. The 2012 vote referenced in the ad was for a reauthorization bill -- that is, an updating of the existing Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed in 2011. Burr was not in Congress when the act itself was initially passed in 1994; he was sworn in for his first term in the U.S. House the following year, in 1995. The 2000 and 2005 votes Congress voted to reauthorize the act in both 2000 and 2005, and both legislative efforts were fairly uncontroversial. For the 2000 effort, Burr was in the House, and he voted in favor of the reauthorization, which was passed by the overwhelming margin of 415-3. While that version didn\u2019t become law, another version did become law during that Congress; it passed the House by voice vote. Individual House members\u2019 votes aren\u2019t recorded in a voice vote, but they are usually only held for non-controversial measures. By the time the 2005 reauthorization effort rolled around, Burr had been elected to the Senate. The reauthorization bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, a process by which senators are given a chance to object to a bill and, if there no objections are made, the bill is deemed passed. So Burr would not have opposed the 2005 reauthorization. The 2012 vote The 2012 reauthorization effort was far more controversial than the previous two, since it involved changes that some social conservatives found objectionable. At the time, the Democrats controlled the presidency and the Senate, while the Republicans controlled the House. The Senate bill would \"\"allow Indian tribal courts to try certain non-Indians in some cases of domestic violence on reservations, expand the number of temporary visas for illegal immigrants who were victims of domestic violence and extend the protections of that act to gay men and lesbians,\"\" the New York Times reported at the time. These provisions were anathema to many conservatives, and when faced with a vote on April 26, 2012, Burr was one of 31 Republicans to vote against it, while 15 Republicans voted for it. Overall, the measure passed the chamber by a 60-31 margin. Instead, Burr voted for a failed Republican-sponsored amendment that would have stripped out some of the elements of the bill that were controversial to Republicans. We were unable to find a contemporaneous explanation by Burr on the reason for his vote through Google or Nexis. The only comment he made on the bill to a media outlet came was procedural rather than substantive, when he said that he thought there were more urgent bills for the chamber to prioritize than the reauthorization. Ultimately, the Republican-led House passed a version that omitted the provisions of the Senate bill that conservatives opposed. The House and Senate were unable to come to an agreement, and the measure was dead for the duration of that Congress. It\u2019s worth noting that Politico reported on March 14, 2012, that the Democratic effort to push a vote on the Violence Against Women Act in the spring of 2012 was to make it a \"\"political weapon.\"\" \"\"Republicans have several objections to the legislation, but instead of making changes, Schumer wants to fast-track the bill to the floor, let the GOP block it, then allow Democrats to accuse Republicans of waging a \u2018war against women,\u2019 \"\" the Politico story said. \"\"It\u2019s fodder for a campaign ad, and it\u2019s not the only potential 30-second spot ready to spring from Senate leadership these days.\"\" With this ad, that mission was accomplished. The 2013 vote After the failure to get the two chambers to agree on a single version in 2012, the new Congress took up the effort again in 2013. Partisan control of each part of government remained the same in 2013, and the reauthorization effort played out in a similar fashion. Republicans pursued an amendment to strip out some of the elements they found problematic, such as the provisions related to native Americans and gender identity. On Feb. 7, 2013, the amendment failed by a 34-65 margin, with Burr voting in favor of it. Then, on Feb. 12, 2013, the Senate passed the original measure, 78-22. Burr was among a handful of Republican senators who switched their position and supported the bill. In fact, Burr has subsequently trumpeted elements of this bill. Burr joined with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to introduce the\u00a0Child Protection Compact Act, which was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. This provision \"\"seeks to protect and rescue children from trafficking by creating \u2018Child Protection Compacts\u2019 between the United States and countries with significant numbers of children in human trafficking,\"\" Burr\u2019s Senate website says. On the other hand, the Ross camp argues, the refusal of Republicans to approve the original bill resulted in a year-long delay in the reauthorization, which kept sexual violence awareness and assistance programs on college campuses from being established, even though reports of sexual assault on college campuses were at an all-time high. So where does this leave us? The Ross camp argues that the ad is accurate since it said that Burr voted against the 2012 version of the bill. They have a point, but making this argument requires ignoring that Burr voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act three times -- in 2000, 2005 and 2013 -- even as he voted against it once, in 2012. The Ross camp also argues that the 2012 vote is important because Burr opposed -- and even voted to strip -- provisions involving LGBT and native Americans. They also have a point here, but their argument would have been stronger had the ad specifically cited Burr\u2019s actions toward LGBT and native Americans. The ad makes no such distinctions; a viewer would be left to assume that he opposed anything to combat violence against women. Finally, we think it\u2019s relevant to note here that, according to Politico, the Democrats specifically teed up this vote to put Republicans in a bind so they could use their votes in campaign ads -- a tactic that both parties have used when they are in a position to do so. Our ruling Ross\u2019 ad said Burr \"\"voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.\"\" Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the law\u2019s reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, the\u00a0ad ignores that\u00a0three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law.\"","label":3,"__index_level_0__":1999}
{"claim_id":"11268","hypothesis":"New \u201cmorning-after\u201d pill effective and safe: FDA staff","explanation_1":"By definition, emergency contraception is meant to be used only when other means of contraception fail. Controversy about emergency contraception typically centers around how it works \u2013 whether it prevents ovulation or blocks implantation of a fertilized egg. If emergency contraception works after fertilization, some would consider it an aborting agent. Regardless of its method of action, however, emergency contraception provides a safe and effective alternative to abortion. Although many women experience uncomfortable side effects from the medication, these are temporary and there are very few risks. In the US, the most commonly used emergency contraceptive is Plan B or levonogestrel. It contains the progestin commonly found in most birth control pills, but in much higher doses. Plan B acts to prevent ovluation. Mifeprex, or RU-486, can be used as an emergency contraceptive or aborting agent depending on when it is used. Last year, the EllaOne was approved for use in Europe and the UK. It has been shown to be effective for up to 5 days after contraceptive failure and has few side effects. Now, the FDA will meet to decide on its approval for use in the US. This story about EllaOne does not mention costs, does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence to support the drug and does not provide quantification of the benefits or harms of the drug. And it doesn\u2019t quote any independent sources outside of the FDA or the pharmaceutical company. Quoting independent sources to provide some perspective on what this might mean to women would have greatly improved this story. The absence of cost info, of comparisons to the most important alternatives (Plan B or Mifeprex), and of any sense of the scope of the benefits or harms were problems with this story. It was not clear that any independent vetting of claims took place.","premise":"\"The story does not mention costs. Although it is hard to say definitively how much the drug would cost in the US since it is not yet available, the story could have mentioned the cost of the drug in Europe or provide an estimate from the drug manufacturer or even from an analyst. The story provides no quanitification of benefits from the drug. Ideally, the story would have described the likelihood of pregnancy after uNPRotected sex with or without the drug. According to British sources \"\"It is estimated that for every 100 women who take Ellaone up to five days after uNPRotected sex, approximately two women will become pregnant. The tablet is more effective at preventing pregnancy the earlier it is taken, so it is important to take it as soon as possible after uNPRotected sex, rather than delay it to the fifth day.\"\" The story mentions that the FDA found no unexpected adverse events and describes the side effects of the drug including nausea, headache and abdominal pain as \"\"common.\"\" The package insert for EllaOne describes these side effects as affecting more than 10% of users. It would have been helpful if the story had cited that stat. The story does not describe the quality of the evidence to support the use of the drug. The story does not engage in disease mongering. The story quotes no independent sources outside of the FDA or the pharmaceutical company. Quoting independent sources to provide some perspective on what this might mean to women, would have greatly improved this story. Although the story mentions other emergency contraceptive options, it does not really describe the pluses and minuses of the new approach compared to the most important alternatives, Plan B or Mifeprex. The story clearly states that the FDA is now reviewing the drug and that it is not yet available in the US but is available in Europe. Clearly the drug is not new since it is already available in Europe. The FDA is now considering its approval for use in the US.

{"claim_id":"15434","hypothesis":"We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right.","explanation_1":"\"Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Sanders was a bit vague about which countries he was comparing to America, but his office clarified that he was thinking of the group that belongs to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. Mexico also has not achieved universal coverage, but Mexico is also a much poorer country and not always considered an industrialized or advanced economy. As for a guaranteed right to health care, Sanders spoke as though every advanced economy had it. In reality, some do and some don\u2019t. He should have talked about universal coverage, but he didn\u2019t. Sanders\u2019 statement lacked some much needed clarity.\"","premise":"\"The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling on Obamacare subsidies kept the program rolling, and\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders was totally celebrating. Still, the independent from Vermont who is running as a Democrat for president told ABC News host George Stephanopoulos that the nation was far from out of the woods on health care. \"\"We still have 35 million Americans without insurance,\"\" Sanders said on June 28, 2015, during an interview on This Week. \"\"We need to join the rest of the industrialized world. We are the only major country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people as a right.\"\" We wanted to check Sanders\u2019 claim that the United States is \"\"the only major country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people as a right.\"\" This is a common theme for Sanders but the words he used this time muddied his message on two fronts -- which countries and what guarantee? A spokesman for Sanders, Michael Briggs, said Sanders was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We\u2019re not sure Sanders made that entirely clear (for instance the OECD doesn\u2019t include China or Russia, which many people would consider a major country), but we\u2019ll put that aside for the moment. Anyway, Briggs directed us to a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries, the United States and Mexico, lack universal health care coverage. \"\"However, Mexico passed a law in 2004 with the goal of establishing universal coverage, and they're currently at 90 percent,\"\" Briggs said. \"\"The ACA was never intended to establish universal coverage, and according to the January CBO estimate, 90 percent is about as good as it's going to get.\"\" We checked and Briggs is close on his numbers. In Mexico, as of 2013, public insurance reached about 86.7 percent of the people. That\u2019s actually not much different from where America stood, if you combine public and private coverage. The figure in the United States was 84.9 percent. However, in 2015, the CBO estimated that 89 percent of American residents -- excluding undocumented immigrants -- have coverage. The number drops to 87 percent if you include undocumented residents. The median income in Mexico is so low, about a third that in the United States, that some would not group it with the stronger OECD countries. In fact, Mexico is often referred to as an emerging or developing economy as opposed to an industrialized or developed one. But since Sanders\u2019 spokesman included it, we thought it only fair to include it, too. Beyond the raw numbers, Sanders statement highlights the tricky questions that come up when you start talking about a right to health care. Is it defined as universal coverage, or a legal right to care? The two are not identical. The gold standard Europe covers both bases. Nearly every European nation has signed and ratified the European Social Charter. That treaty\u2019s section on health care casts health care as a right. \"\"The system of health care must be accessible to the entire population. To that end, states should take as their main criterion for judging the success of health system reforms effective access to health care for all, without discrimination, as a basic human right.\"\" Countries follow different paths to make good on that promise. Great Britain has its national health service where the government runs the hospitals and pays the doctors and nurses. Germany and France have a more complicated mix of highly regulated public and private insurance companies, and, as in America, a law that makes insurance mandatory for everyone. Those European nations score 100 when it comes to universal coverage. But so does Australia, and Australia operates under no legal claim that health care is a right. The government\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Department posted on its website \"\"there is no Commonwealth legislation explicitly enshrining the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\"\" That doesn\u2019t stop the Aussies from running an extensive system of public hospitals and a robust public health insurance program. Japan uses a different mix of tools to achieve the same results, and it too lacks a formal legal right to health care. There is a substantial body of Japanese health care law, but it has to do with creating various government programs and setting the rules of the game. A weak guarantee There are several international treaties and conventions that speak of the obligation of countries to provide for the health of their residents. The list includes the World Health Organization constitution and the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United States signed and ratified the former, but is literally one of a handful of countries that has not ratified the latter. For some, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a landmark document that comes very close to asserting health care as a right. The treaty\u2019s language is ambitious. It speaks of \"\"the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\"\" Countries that get behind it promise that they will \u00a0aim to create the \"\"conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.\"\" But the convention\u2019s legal heft is considerably less than its stated goals. It pushes no country to spend beyond its \"\"available resources,\"\" a quantity that could be whatever the leaders say it is. Lawrence Gostin is the director of Georgetown University\u2019s O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Gostin said the convention lacks teeth. \"\"These international obligations are vague and unenforceable so really don\u2019t translate into a \u2018right\u2019 in all states,\"\" Gostin said. For Gostin, the test of a nation\u2019s commitment should be measured by the facts on the ground. \"\"Does it provide even reasonably fair access to the entire population, and is there a way to enforce or implement the right,\"\" Gostin said. \"\"By those measures, the U.S. has many entitlements to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and ACA subsidies. Yes there are many left out but that is true in lots of countries, including China that provides a minuscule amount of health dollars to rural residents.\"\" Whether China is an industrialized country of the sort Sanders mentioned is a matter of debate, but China helps illustrate the difference between a right in law and a right in practice. China has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On top of that, its Constitution commits the state to provide health services and facilities \"\"all for the protection of the people's health.\"\" But the record of the world\u2019s most populous nation is checkered to say the least. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston-based health policy group, wrote about the evolution of health care in China. In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Blumenthal wrote that about 95 percent of the population has access to modest coverage. \"\"The government has decided to provide all Chinese some protection against the cost of illness, not necessarily as a matter of right, but as a matter of fact,\"\" Blumenthal told PolitiFact. Ake Blomqvist, a health care economist at Carleton University in Canada, has a dimmer view of the connection between China\u2019s legal promises and what it delivers. China might have signed that UN convention but that has had limited effect. \"\"In reality the majority of people in China are at risk of not being able to receive even urgently needed health care if they are unlucky enough to require something that is expensive,\"\" Blomqvist said. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Sanders was a bit vague about which countries he was comparing to America, but his office clarified that he was thinking of the group that belongs to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

{"claim_id":"38986","hypothesis":"\u00a0 Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are radioactive and add more toxicity to the environment than regular light bulbs because they contain mercury. ","explanation_1":"Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs) Emit Radiation, Contain Mercury","premise":"This one is true, false and misleading all at once. There is truth in claims that CFLs give off ultraviolet (UV) radiation and contain mercury, but studies show that those concerns have been exaggerated. The debate over CFLs started in 2007 after President George W. Bush signed the  Energy Independence and Security Act into law. The bill required screw-based light blubs to use fewer watts for similar brightness by 2014 to save energy. The bill also requires most light bulbs to be 60-70% more efficient than regular incandescent light bulbs by 2020. Many have interpreted the law to mean that consumers must use CFLs, but that isn\u2019t the case. The law doesn\u2019t restrict the types of light bulbs that can be sold, just the amount of energy they use. Right now, CFLs and LEDs meet the 2020 energy requirement, according to the  bill. But that doesn\u2019t mean more options won\u2019t be available by 2020. Claims that CFLs are radioactive and toxic have been around since Congress introduced the bill. A\u00a0page posted\u00a0on the website Live Leak provides one example: \u201cConsider this \u2013 instead of\u00a0saving the environment, CFLs are actually destroying it. CFLs\u00a0should be thought\u00a0of as toxic technology, when mercury contamination, ultraviolet radiation,\u00a0and\u00a0radio frequency radiation are factored in. From cradle to grave, CFLs pose a\u00a0danger to\u00a0people\u2019s health and well being, as well as adding even more toxicity\u00a0to the environment. In\u00a0fact, CFLs do not reduce a person\u2019s carbon footprint and\u00a0may even increase it in some\u00a0situations. To make matters even worse, CFLs emit\u00a0harmful levels of electromagnetic\u00a0radiation. \u201c Let\u2019s take a look at each of these claims. First, it\u2019s true that CFLs emit ultra-violet (UV) radiation. Researchers at Stony Brook University found that UV leaked from cracks in the phosphor coatings on CFLs. Their  study found that CFLs should not be used at close distances and should be placed behind glass covers. The UV radiation was on par with what is given off by standard fluorescent lights, so the risk for skin damage is not great. There is also a small amount of mercury in CFLs, as the eRumor claims. If a bulb breaks, there is some risk of mercury exposure, but, again, it\u2019s not great, the National Institutes of Health  reports: \u201c\u2019The amount of mercury gas coming off (broken CFLs) is over a milligram over a few days. If you put\u00a0that milligram into a poorly ventilated room, the concentration can be over the recommended limit for\u00a0children,\u201d says Robert Hurt, the director of the Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale\u00a0Innovation. \u2018The overall risk is low, but it\u2019s not zero risk, and there is definitely an opportunity to do\u00a0better.\u2019 \u201c\u2026Hurt\u2019s research suggests that the peak for escaping mercury vapor lasts a few hours. The\u00a0group also found that plastic bags leaked mercury vapor. \u2018This new information may allow for\u00a0modeling of airborne mercury concentrations following breakage, thus providing the capability to more\u00a0fully assess the effectiveness of cleanup,\u2019 says Roxanne Smith, a press officer for the EPA.\u201d The EPA\u2019s tips for cleaning up broken CFLs can be found  here. Finally, the claim that CFLs add more toxicity to the environment than regular bulbs because of their mercury content is false. CFLs actually reduce the amount of mercury entering the environment because less energy is required to use them. That means less mercury-emitting coal needs to be burned, the National Institutes of Health  reports. Comments","label":3,"__index_level_0__":1227}
{"claim_id":"10807","hypothesis":"Stem Cells Repair Heart in First-Ever Study","explanation_1":"This story creates a sense that this experimental approach is about to change the course of heart medicine and that, so far, it has only been made available to a very lucky few. The story notes that a \u201cstudy researcher \u2026 could barely contain his excitement in an interview with WebMD.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s the job of journalism to dispassionately evaluate evidence and provide necessary context and caveats. But our reviewers thought too much of the uncontained excitement came through without enough of the C words. The American Heart Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions is one of the largest medical conferences in the world, generating a lot of overly effusive coverage every year. As difficult as it may be, reporters need to work especially hard during conferences to find independent sources who can provide cautious analysis of a study\u2019s results, especially when a study is this small and has potential pitfalls built into the study\u2019s design.","premise":"The story makes no mention of costs. Because this is a phase 1 study, no costs can be determined at this stage. Needless to say, the costs are likely, however, to be significant. There is widespread concern that when stem cell therapies do become available for some conditions that they will be cost prohibitive. The reason so many stem cell studies have enrolled so few patients is, in part, because research costs are so high, and that translates into higher costs for patients down the road. The story could have benefited from an info-graphic to break down all the numbers of patients used at various times in the story: 20 enrolled, \u201cresults are in for only the first 16,\u201d 14 patients analyzed so far, 8 seen for one year. Wouldn\u2019t that have been much more clear than scattering all of these numbers throughout the story? That makes it difficult to understand the scope of the benefits. The story spends a lot of time talking about just one patient and, in an unusual move for a study like this, the story names the patient:\u00a0 Michael Jones. This anecdote may not reflect the results seen to date in all the subjects treated. Preliminary results can be statistically important but may not be clinically important in the long run. The researchers saw an improvement in the ejection fraction in subjects treated (on average going from 30.3% to 38.5%)\u00a0 It should be noted that to be enrolled, all patients needed to have an ejection fraction of less than 40%. So, in spite of the improvement, the subjects on average still had severe heart failure at the end of this phase of the study. The story says that there were no side effects from the treatments. We would have liked to have seen more detail on how long the patients were followed (we\u2019re only told that 8 have been followed for one year) and the types of side effects one might expect with this type of therapy. The subjects underwent cardiac surgery during which time cardiac tissue was recovered and the stem cells were injected into the heart via a catheter. Each procedure carries the potential for harm. In reporting on such a small, short-term study, we think the potential for harm is worth at least a line. The story is reporting on the preliminary results of a phase 1 study in a small number of subjects in an open label trial designed to determine the safety of the approach. All of that is explained at one point or another in the story. But it\u2019s wrapped in language of \u201cmajor breakthrough\u2026unexpected magnitude\u2026quite encouraging.\u201d While the results to date are encouraging the story provides an overly optimistic view of the study results. Importantly, these are interim results in a handful of the subjects enrolled. Although there are notable attempts to temper the overall enthusiastic view, many readers may walk away with unrealistic expectations. The story makes one nod to problems with the quality of the evidence. It quotes the lead researcher on the study saying, \u201c    Now this is an open-label trial, so patients know they are treated. This means we have to take what they say with a grain of salt.\u201d He then quickly brushes that concern away, though, by saying, \u201cBut we see these patients not only are feeling better but doing more.\u201d That\u2019s the overwhelming message from this story, even though the study\u2019s design may have skewed the results. By the definition of this criterion, the story does not commit disease-mongering about heart failure after heart attack. So we\u2019ll give it a satisfactory score on this criterion. Many times, though, our reviewers wish to comment on what they consider to be treatment mongering. And that was the case this time as well. The story sets a tone of urgency and awe early in the story that carries through the rest of the story, culminating in the idea that people are somehow missing out on a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d \u2013 a term used twice in the story. \u201c    The only downside of this early success is that the ongoing study already has enrolled all 20 of the patients who will be treated. The experimental treatment simply will not be available to other patients in the near future.\u201d Readers with heart disease worried that they may have missed their chance to find a cure are told \u201cto maintain close contact with their doctors\u201d. This creates a panic mentality that does not serve patients or stem cell science. The story presented one independent perspective and a quote from an editorial that accompanied the study. The experimental approach is not compared to existing alternatives. There is     a passing reference to \u201clifestyle changes and medical management\u201d. Were all of these patients taking the same medications and following the same diet and exercise routines prior to the study and during the study? What is currently the best course for the types of heart conditions these patients have? These are among the many questions not answered in the story. The story explains that these findings are from a small study early in the development of a stem cell therapy and that the treatment is not going to be available in the near term. It says that a \u201clarger, phase II study is planned.\u201d More important, it clearly states \u201cthe experimental treatment simply will not be available to other patients in the near future.\u201d The novelty of the treatment is established. The story does note that the technique is new and was developed by one of the researchers. The story does not rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":1065}
{"claim_id":"28825","hypothesis":"Researchers have discovered that octopus genomes contain alien DNA.","explanation_1":"\"Rsearchers didn't discover that octopus DNA is \"\"alien,\"\" or that it originated anywhere but on Earth, although a few have suggested the possibilty.\"","premise":"In June 2016, a number of web sites reported that, according to recent study, researchers had examined octopus DNA and discovered it was either \u201calien\u201d or \u201cfrom space\u201d: The DNA of octopus may not be from this world, scientists revealed. The new study concluded that octopuses actually have alien DNA! According to the study published in the journal Nature, octopuses have a genome that yields an unprecedented level of complexity, composed of 33,000 protein-coding genes. This number is way beyond the number that can be found in a human being. Other dubious online site made similar assertions, claiming that the study showed beyond a doubt that octupuses\u00a0don\u2019t come from the planet Earth: Now, it seems as if aliens always existed amongst us, but we never knew it! If a new study is to be believed, Octopuses are actually aliens! The study concluded that octopuses have \u201calien\u201d genes and more probing from the marine biologists can reveal more breakthroughs. The world is still so vast and we only knew half of what is really out there! A new study has led researchers to conclude that Octopuses (NOT Octopi) have Alien DNA. Their genome shows a never-before-seen level of complexity with a staggering 33,000 protein-coding genes identified, more than in a human being. US researcher Dr. Clifton Ragsdale, from the University of Chicago, said: The octopus appears to be utterly different from all other animals, even other molluscs, with its eight prehensile arms, its large brain, and its clever problem-solving abilities. \u201cThe late British zoologist Martin Wells said the octopus is an alien. In this sense, then, our paper describes the first sequenced genome from an alien.\u201d The underlying study did not assert extraterrestrial origins for the octopus, however: Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems. The study had been published in August 2015, and it was unclear why multiple web sites suddenly picked up and ran with a completely erroneous interpretation of it nearly a year after it first appeared. The \u201calien\u201d angle seems to have originated with a press release, which (like the study) was published in 2015: \u201cThe octopus appears to be utterly different from all other animals, even other molluscs, with its eight prehensile arms, its large brain and its clever problem-solving capabilities,\u201d said co-senior author Clifton Ragsdale, associate professor in Neurobiology and Organismal Biology and Anatomy at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe late British zoologist Martin Wells said the octopus is an alien. In this sense, then, our paper describes the first sequenced genome from an alien.\u201d It was clear that Ragsdale meant that\u00a0the octopus was an alien metaphorically, not literally. But, as is often the case, a number of web outlets seized upon the use of the word to spin up stories without first reviewing\u00a0the source material: Yesterday, a number of sites started running stories that seemed to imply that octopuses are aliens. As in, from outer space (?). The Yahoo! News headline ran with Octopus genetic code reveals \u2018alien creature\u2019; over at the Mirror, they were having a field day with Octopus genetic code is so strange it could be an ALIEN, according to scientists; and the Irish Examiner proudly proclaimed, Don\u2019t freak out, but scientists think octopuses \u2018might be aliens\u2019 after DNA study. The words \u201calien,\u201d \u201cspace,\u201d or even \u201cEarth\u201d didn\u2019t appear in the August 2015 study of octopus gene sequencing. However, a\u00a0tongue-in-cheek remark made later by one researcher was widely taken out of context to suggest otherwise. Coincidentally, a controversial paper subsequently published in the March 2018 issue of the journal Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology (\u201cCause of Cambrian Explosion \u2013 Terrestrial or Cosmic?\u201d) examined whether some aspects of evolutionary theory might be better explained by positing that the precursors of some Earth organisms could have been extraterrestrial in nature. The paper offered an example which suggested \u2014 but did not prove \u2014 that one possible explanation for why octopuses (cephalopods) are very different from their presumed evolutionary ancestors (nautiloids) might be that their genes came \u201cfrom the cosmos at large\u201d:  Some genetic features from recent data in the Octopus and other Cephalopods provide challenging examples to conventional evolutionary thinking. The genome of the Octopus shows a staggering level of complexity with 33,000 protein-coding genes more than is present in Homo sapiens. Octopus belongs to the coleoid sub-class of molluscs (Cephalopods) that have an evolutionary history that stretches back over 500 million years, although Cephalopod phylogenetics is highly inconsistent and confusing. Cephalopods are also very diverse, with the behaviourally complex coleoids, (Squid, Cuttlefish and Octopus) presumably arising under a pure terrestrial evolutionary model from the more primitive nautiloids. However, the genetic divergence of Octopus from its ancestral coleoid sub-class is very great, akin to the extreme features seen across many genera and species noted in Eldridge-Gould punctuated equilibria patterns. Its large brain and sophisticated nervous system, camera-like eyes, flexible bodies, instantaneous camouflage via the ability to switch colour and shape are just a few of the striking features that appear suddenly on the evolutionary scene. The transformative genes leading from the consensus ancestral Nautilus (e.g. Nautilus pompilius) to the common Cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to Squid (Loligo vulgaris) to the common Octopus (Octopus vulgaris) are not easily to be found in any pre-existing life form \u2014 it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant \u201cfuture\u201d in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large. The paper maintained we should not \u201cdiscount\u201d the notion that octopus genes may have been \u201cextraterrestrial imports\u201d which \u201carrived in icy bolides several hundred million years ago\u201d:   One plausible explanation, in our view, is that the new genes are likely new extraterrestrial imports to Earth \u2014 most plausibly as an already coherent group of functioning genes within (say) cryopreserved and matrix protected fertilized Octopus eggs. Thus the possibility that cryopreserved Squid and\/or Octopus eggs, arrived in icy bolides several hundred million years ago should not be discounted, as that would be a parsimonious cosmic explanation for the Octopus\u2019 sudden emergence on Earth ca. 270 million years ago. However, the paper also noted that \u201csuch an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm.\u201d  And as Ephrat Livni observed in Quartz, other scientists don\u2019t necessarily find the paper\u2019s ruminations something to be taken seriously:  Virologist Karin Moelling of the Max Planck Institute Molecular Genetics in Berlin isn\u2019t convinced, although she says that the paper is worth contemplating because there\u2019s still so much we don\u2019t know about the origins of life on Earth. She writes in in a commentary in the same publication, \u201cSo this article is useful, calling for attention, and it is worth thinking about, yet the main statement about viruses, microbes and even animals coming to us from space, cannot be taken seriously.\u201d Evolutionary scientist Keith Baverstock from the University of Eastern Finland, in his commentary on the paper, is equally wary. The proposed theories \u201cwould support an extra-terrestrial origin of life,\u201d he writes. Still, they don\u2019t necessarily lead to that conclusion; there are other plausible explanations for the evidence the paper offers.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":9669}
{"claim_id":"9228","hypothesis":"FDA approves Intrarosa for postmenopausal women experiencing pain during sex","explanation_1":"The US Food and Drug Administration just approved Intrarosa, a once-daily vaginal insert used to treat women experiencing pain during sexual intercourse. The news release states that the drug\u2019s efficacy was confirmed in two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials of around 400 postmenopausal women. \u201cIntrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse,\u201d it says. That was about the extent of the discussion in addressing benefits and quality of evidence, as there are no quantitative data given, and no mention of the study\u2019s design and limitations. With such lack of detail, we also don\u2019t know how concerned we should be with the drug\u2019s adverse effects, which could include \u201cabnormal\u201d pap smears. If the news release refers to studies that the FDA used to evaluate the drug\u2019s efficacy, it would be helpful if the FDA included the journal name and date of publication of the trials that informed the approval. And then the news release should clearly break down the results of those studies \u2014 complete with quantitative data \u2014 for journalists and the public. Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a common condition affecting 50 to 60 percent of postmenopausal women. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, pain during sexual intercourse and irritation\/itching. Intrarosa\u2019s active ingredient\u00a0dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), also known as prasterone, is already sold over-the-counter as a dietary supplement \u2014 which is not FDA-approved, as the news release points out. Potential effects of DHEA on cardiovascular and brain health, metabolism and sexuality have been extensively studied for the past 20 years in postmenopausal women. Although short-term usage is not considered problematic, researchers are unsure if DHEA is safe with long-term usage or at higher doses. Therefore, it is critical that our regulatory agency evaluates independent, unbiased clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals. And if any trial has an obvious limitation, such as a short follow-up time, then it is the responsibility of the news release to highlight this, even in the wake of FDA approval.","premise":"The FDA evaluates drugs without consideration of cost, so it\u2019s understandable that they wouldn\u2019t comment on it \u2014 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re rating this Not Applicable. We look forward to the day when any news release about a new drug \u2014 even one from the FDA \u2014 includes some mention of cost in its message. After all, the value of a new drug is a function not just of how well it works, but its cost-effectiveness. With the newly approved Intrarosa are we looking at $10 or $100 for each round of treatment? Its active ingredient, DHEA, is sometimes used as a dietary supplement. On Goodrx.com, a bottle of 300 25-mg tablets of Natrol goes for $13.29. The news release states simply, \u201cIntrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse.\u201d No data are provided to back up this claim. Without any numbers, it\u2019s impossible to evaluate how beneficial the treatment actually is. How many women from the treatment group experienced this benefit? And although it\u2019s difficult to quantitatively assess pain, it could still be addressed by scores (e.g. On a scale from one to ten, how bad was the pain before treatment and then after treatment?). Without any idea of how much pain was actually reduced, readers have no idea whether the advantages of this therapy outweighs its costs and risks. This is a point that we recently addressed in one of our blog posts, since news releases put out by the FDA often miss the mark on this criterion. More details, especially in the form of quantitative data, are badly needed. As a result, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. Every intervention carries its own sets of risks. For Intrarosa, the most common side effects include vaginal discharge and an abnormal pap smear, according to the news release. But it doesn\u2019t detail what \u201cabnormal\u201d means or explain what the implications are for women who receive such a result. It also doesn\u2019t quantify the potential harms, including how many women experienced these adverse effects. Furthermore, the clinical trials cited in this release lasted for only 12 weeks, meaning long-term effects were not investigated. According to the US National Library of Medicine, the active ingredient DHEA may be unsafe if taken in high doses or long-term. Researchers also say DHEA may cause decreased breast size, a deep voice, increased genital size, irregular periods, oily skin and unnatural hair growth in women. Since the news release doesn\u2019t describe potential harms or talk about the drug\u2019s long-term effects, we give it a Not Satisfactory rating here. We wish the news release would have gone into more detail on what clinical studies were used to gain FDA approval for the product. All we know is that there were two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials in 406 healthy postmenopausal women between 40 to 80 years of age. We don\u2019t know whether the trials were randomized and blinded, how the participants were selected, how the trials were run (assessment criteria, number of follow-ups, etc.) and whether the results were published in peer-reviewed journals. We also aren\u2019t\u00a0exactly sure to which studies the news release is referring or how to access them for additional reference. Due to all these reasons, we give the news release a Not Satisfactory rating here. There is no disease mongering in this news release. The release doesn\u2019t disclose the funders of the studies the drug approval was based on. In the one study we could find via an online search, it disclosed that EndoCeutics sponsored the research. The first author of the Menopause journal article is also the President and CEO of EndoCeutics, while the second author is an EndoCeutics consultant and receives grants for clinical studies. We feel this is a major conflict of interest that should have been highlighted in the news release. There is no discussion of alternatives in this short news release. There are many interventions available now for vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), including hormonal and non-hormonal therapies. Over-the-counter treatments include non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers for VVA symptoms, as well as lubricants to alleviate pain during sexual intercourse. Water-based vaginal moisturizers are available as liquids, gels or ovules and are inserted every few days. Silicone or water-based vaginal lubricants are shorter acting than moisturizers and are applied right before sexual activity. Postmenopausal women can also opt for low-dose vaginal estrogen preparations in the form of creams, rings or tablets to treat their VVA. Since none of these options are mentioned in the news release, we give it an Not Satisfactory rating here. The news release doesn\u2019t disclose how soon consumers can expect to find Intrarosa at their local drug store. However, it does make clear that DHEA is already out on the market as a dietary supplement, although these have not been FDA approved for safety and efficacy for \u201cdiagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating or preventing any disease.\u201d We feel this mention is good enough for a Satisfactory rating here. DHEA is not a new drug. Researchers have also looked at DHEA\u2019s effects on cardiovascular risk, memory and metabolism in older populations. And it\u2019s also sold over-the-counter as a dietary supplement, the news release points out. But it also states Intrarosa is the first FDA approved product containing prasterone, or DHEA. Therefore, we give it a Satisfactory rating here. The news release does not use unjustifiable, sensational language. The single quote from the FDA spokesperson also contains neutral, measured language.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":1116}
{"claim_id":"35996","hypothesis":"The federal deficit when U.S. President Barack Obama left office was $585 billion, climbing to $984 billion in January 2019.","explanation_1":"Smoke from Australia\u2019s fierce bushfires settled over Sydney in still conditions on Tuesday, setting off fire alarms, and halting ferry services as famous landmarks disappeared behind some of the worst haze seen in the harbor city.","premise":"A 60 km (37.2 miles) firefront is devastating tinder-dry areas northwest of Sydney, Australia\u2019s largest city, and sending hazardous smoke across the east and over the Pacific, even causing haze more than 2,000 km (1243 miles) away in New Zealand, satellite images show. \u201cThis smoky period we\u2019ve been experiencing for the past month or so, it is unprecedented, so these conditions are a risk to people\u2019s health,\u201d said Richard Broome, the New South Wales government\u2019s director of environmental health. Broome said while many people would experience sore eyes, nose and throat irritations, those with pre-existing health conditions and young children and the elderly were at particular risk. Sydney\u2019s air quality index readings in some parts of the city on Tuesday were 11 times the threshold considered hazardous, government data showed. The wildfires have blanketed Sydney - home to more than 5 million people and better known for its clear skies and blue harbor - in smoke and ash for more than two weeks. That haze has turned the daytime sky orange, obscured visibility and prompted many commuters to wear breathing masks. Bushfires are common in Australia\u2019s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires last month in the southern hemisphere spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry. While there is no official evacuation order, many locals in areas that are under threat have decided to leave their homes, Hawkesbury Mayor Barry Calvert told Reuters. \u201cIt is eerie, many people have decided to leave, and I\u2019m going to do the same,\u201d said Calvert, who lives north-west of Sydney. \u201cI\u2019ve been through this before about 20 years ago when I stood outside my house looking at flames 50 feet high, I decided then that I would leave early if it happened again.\u201d  All up, there are more than 100 fires ablaze in the eastern states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, many of which have been burning since November. The fires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland. Many outdoor events were canceled in smoke-filled areas on Tuesday, including a lead-up to the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, that was scheduled to take place on the harbor. Sydney\u2019s ferries, which started the day using foghorns as they cautiously moved through the thick smoke, were halted at lunch time as visibility fell even further. The dense smoke even seeped into buildings on Tuesday, triggering alarms in offices and homes, and at train stations and university campuses, authorities said.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":2985}
{"claim_id":"11176","hypothesis":"Researchers Make Progress With Insomnia","explanation_1":"This story covers a\u00a0relatively new\u00a0area of research into the biology of sleep. The story would have been more valuable had it contained some more pertinent background and context. It\u00a0details the early stage development of a drug being studied as a treatment for insomnia that differs from the currently available drugs used as sleep aids. This story included little evidence other than a brief mention that the drug discussed blocked the receptors in the brain for a protein known as orexin. The story did not accurately present the information in the research paper that it was reporting on. For example, the article suggest that the drug induces sleep when it actually was found to reduce latency to sleep. The study found that at higher doses, the drug decreased time to sleep\u00a0as compared to placebo. This was not mentioned in the story. The story should have made clear that the early-phase studies were done in a total of 70 healthy adults. There has not yet been any examination of whether this drug has any efficacy for people actually suffering with insomnia. The story mentioned that cataplexy is a potential side effect that may be seen with use of this drug and that the studies to date have not eliminated the chance that it may be a problem. However the story failed to present a sufficiently complete picture of the role of orexin in the human brain for the reader to understand the complexity. Orexins are involved in appetite, regulation of growth hormone and leutinizing hormone as well as sleep. It is a bit simplistic to assume that the blocking of the receptors would only produce sleep. It is also important to note that the study used single doses of the drug in the human subjects. The story did not give an idea how big the potential harms or benefits may be. Several experts in the field were quoted. Though clear that\u00a0this drug acts differently than those currently on the market they were also clear to point out that the potential for this drug must be viewed with some skepticism until the quality of the sleep induced and the extent to which side effects occur can be established.","premise":"There was no estimate for the cost of treatment, however as the drug is not available, this should be considered N\/A. There was no quantification of benefits of treatment other than to explain that this drug may promote sleep and may have use for helping people deal with insomnia. But the drug is at an early stage of its testing and so it is premature to assume that since it can promote sleep in a laboratory setting, that it will be a useful treatment for people affected by inadequate sleep. The story mentioned that cataplexy is a potential side effect that may be seen with use of this drug and that the studies to date have not eliminated the chance that it may be a problem.

There has not yet been any examination of whether this drug has any efficacy for people actually suffering with insomnia. This story did not include elements of disease mongering. The story quoted two researchers without apparent ties to the company developing the drug or the authors of the paper. Although this was a story about a potential new approach to managing insomnia, it did not contain information on the data demonstrating how attention to sleep hygiene can reduce insomnia, nor did it mention any available treatments for insomnia \u2013 other than to\u00a0say that the drug discussed in this story differed significantly from other sleep aids that are available. The story was clear that the drug discussed is only in testing phases. The story was not explicit that the drug\u00a0does not appear to currently be undergoing clinical evaluation in the US. There is growing evidence in the medical literature about the utility of blocking the orexin receptor as a means of promoting sleep. This story reported on a drug in development that has shown the potential to act in this fashion. However, rather than being new, the observation that there is a relationship between orexin and sleep has been known for at least five years and this drug is not unique in that there are several orexin blocking compounds that are in similar preclinical testing phases. Because the story used several sources, some of them injecting some cautionary comments, it does not appear that it relied solely or largely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":450}
{"claim_id":"10285","hypothesis":"For many women, breast reduction means less pain and more activity","explanation_1":"\"This story on breast reduction surgery is triggered by news reports about Simona Halep, a Romanian tennis player whose breasts are so large they reportedly affect her performance on court. While this has launched predictably vulgar chatter around the Internet, it does create something of a \"\"teachable moment\"\" on the topic of macromastia, as the condition of excessive breast size is known. Alas, the Daily News isn\u2019t quite up for the challenge. On the positive side, the reporter did talk to four breast surgery specialists and provides a basic explanation of the condition. The reader essentially learns that macromastia can be serious\u2013that it causes pain, limits activity and can be treated with surgery. On the negative side:   The story conveys the impression that the surgery is effective without providing any credible information to verify this. It does not mention the risks of the surgery. It does not report on costs. It fails to distinguish between breast reduction for cosmetic and medical reasons. The story\u2019s rosy view of the surgery is likely to have been shaped by the enthusiasm of the four plastic surgeons used as sources, one of whom has \"\"his\"\" own technique, called the \"\"lollipop lift.\"\" All have economic self-interest in seeing breast reduction surgery portrayed as medically important and highly effective. The story has conveyed this viewpoint without resistance. [Curiously, all of the sources are men.] A reader is likely to exit this story with plenty of questions: How successful is the surgery, and how long-lasting are\u00a0 the symptoms? At what point does breast size become a treatable condition? At what point do the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks? Is this problem best treated early to prevent chronic pain from settling in? Alas, the story doesn\u2019t explore any of these questions. And it can\u2019t go without a final mention: Comparing the symptoms of excessively large breasts to those of metastatic cancer is just shameful.\"","premise":"The story fails to mention the cost of breast reduction, which ranges from $6,000 to $10,000. The story includes the fact that insurance sometimes pays. But readers would be curious to know what might qualify\/disqualify women for coverage. The story describes the benefits of breast reduction surgery but does not use any data to quantify the frequency or magnitude of the benefit. The story fails to mention the risks of breast reduction surgery, which are considerable: infection, bleeding, blood clots, nerve and muscle damage, plus the risks associated with anesthesia. Further, the story fails to mention a risk of great importance to younger women: inability to breastfeed. The story does not cite any evidence of rates of pain reduction and increased mobility. The story quotes a doctor who compares the pain of macromastia to the pain suffered by someone with metastatic cancer of the spine. This is a shamefully sensational exaggeration. It is completely unnecessary to make the point that macromastia is a serious and debilitating condition. The story includes comments from four plastic surgeons linked to credible institutions. Having said that, all of the sources are biased in favor of the procedure for reasons of economic self-interest. It\u2019s also worth noting that all four are men. The story quotes a specialist saying that women with macromastia who do not have surgery can wear special reinforced bras, sports bras or even two bras, and can treat pain with analgesics and rashes with ointments. The story states that 140,000 women per year get breast reduction surgery. This clearly implies wide availability. The story makes plain that the surgery is commonly done and makes no claim for its novelty. There does not appear to be a press release linked to this story.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":1659}
{"claim_id":"10572","hypothesis":"New inhaler protects lungs against effects of air pollution","explanation_1":"This is a romp through a field of unsubstantiated claims on the benefits and promise of a new device that purports to protect the body from air pollution-induced illnesses. The hyperbole begins with the title and continues through the story. The story hints at evidence but provides no substantiation of the claims made by the sources\u00a0in the story. The clinical and financial impact of air pollution is an important public health issue that deserves coverage. While attempts to reduce the production of pollutants has been somewhat successful, other strategies are newsworthy, including the potential for a low cost and non-toxic preventive. Although the research to date has been \u201cpromising\u201d it is a long way from promise to fruition. Resorting to excessive claims of benefits leads readers astray and compromises the integrity of the research effort.","premise":"The expected cost to UK\u00a0consumers is noted ($17 pounds\/month). The reader is provided with no information on the presumed benefit of ectoine other than glowing comments and two references available via URL. The two studies noted include one in rats and one in human cell culture. No information is provided about studies in humans, although one source says\u00a0the \u201cinhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon.\u201d This begs the question of the need for this story now rather than after the publication of the results. Harms are not explained. The comments of one doctor in the story\u00a0suggest that the compound is inert, supporting the notion that there are no harms. But a quick check of a material safety data sheet reveals some concern about the potential for ectoine to produce pulmonary edema if inhaled, in addition to eye and skin irritation. Dr. Andreas Bilstein is quoted saying, \u201cThe inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon.\u201d How many patients? Under what conditions? For how long? How were the benefits measured? Other than a series of positive quotes about ectoine, the reader is provided with little in the way of substantiation. There is a suggestion that all of us who live in cosmopolitan areas where particulate pollution is a problem will need to start and end our day with an ectoine inhaler or risk type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, COPD and a host of other maladies. Also, the article should be mindful of statements such as the ones below, which may unintentionally incite fear in the public. \u201cOutdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year\u2026\u201d \u201cIn the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d These types of statistics are, first of all, hard to wrap one\u2019s mind around. Overuse of them has numbed people to their impact and effect. Comments from one independent source are provided and the potential conflicts of interest of Dr. Klutman and Bilstein are in part duly noted. The article does provide at least one alternative strategy, though it wasn\u2019t explained clearly: \u201cAntioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: \u2018Personally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements. '\u201d It also mentioned the need to reduce harmful vehicle emissions, though it said more short-term solutions were needed. The story makes it relatively clear that the inhaler isn\u2019t available but should be soon. More specifics would have been helpful, though. The use of a ectoine for prevention of pollution-related illness is novel and the story provided sufficient backstory with this detail: \u201cThe protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.\u201d Technically, the story was not pulled from a press release. We do wonder however why the story was thought to be newsworthy at this time since\u00a0trial\u00a0results are apparently to be published soon.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":1528}
