Although cases of cross-border contamination have been rare, this case highlights the risk of Ebola spreading across the border into neighboring Uganda and Rwanda.

In June, a family of Congolese with some sick family members crossed into Uganda via a bush path.

Uganda has had multiple outbreaks of Ebola and hemorrhagic fevers since 2000. Because the 9-year-old Ebola victim passed through an official entry point this week, Ugandan health authorities believe she had no contact with any Ugandan. But at least five other Congolese, including attendants to patients, who shared an ambulance with the sick girl have been identified by Ugandan officials as Ebola contacts. Four of them have since been taken back to Congo for vaccination and monitoring, said Joyce Moriku Kaducu, Ugandan minister of state in charge of primary health care. Ebola has killed nearly 2,000 people in eastern Congo since August 2018. The disease is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. WHO said Friday that cases have reached 3,000 in Congo, with 1,893 confirmed deaths and about 900 survivors. On average, 80 people per week are sickened by the virus, which has infected most people in Congo\u2019s North Kivu province.

Insecurity has been one factor in a region where rebel groups have fought for control of mineral-rich lands for decades.

{"claim_id":"3017","hypothesis":"As wildfires get worse, smoke spreads, stokes health worries.","explanation_1":"First came the flames, a raging firestorm propelled by 50 mph (80 kph) wind gusts that incinerated Kelsey Norton\u2019s house and killed 85 people in her community.","premise":"Then came the smoke \u2014 not just from the forest but also from some 14,000 houses and their contents that burned, generating a thick plume that enshrouded portions of Northern California for weeks and left Norton gasping. And since the fire, more than a year now, it has been sickness: repeated respiratory infections that sap Norton\u2019s strength, interfere with her work and leave the 30-year-old cardiac care nurse worried about future health problems. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have cancer in my 50s because I inhaled smoke in my 30s,\u201d she said. The immediate toll of lives and property lost when a fire tore through the Sierra Nevada foothills town of Paradise, California in November 2018 is well documented. Still unknown is the long-term impact of the intense smoke exposure suffered by the tragedy\u2019s survivors and the hundreds of thousands of people living in communities downwind of the blaze. Increasingly intense wildfires are scorching forests from across the  Western U.S. to Australia  and stoking concern among residents and health professionals about long-term health impacts from smoke exposure. The issue has far-reaching implications as climate change turns some regions of the globe drier and more prone to fires that send up smoke plumes that can travel thousands of miles and affect millions of people. The unprecedented fires burning across Australia  offer the most recent example as they blanket major cities with dangerous air pollution. Smoke from those fires, which started burning in September, by this week had spread across more than 7.7 million square miles (20 million square kilometers) and drifted across the Pacific Ocean  to reach South America, according to the United Nation\u2019s meteorological agency and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Th e fires have torched more than 2,000 houses and killed at least 26 people. Authorities ordered new evacuations in New South Wales and the neighboring state of Victoria as rising temperatures and erratic winds on Friday threatened to fan dozens of blazes still burning out of control. Both states issued hazardous air quality warnings for affected areas and said people with health problems should consider relocating until the smoke clears. Compounding the danger, experts and firefighters say, is the proliferation of construction materials and household items made from petroleum-based plastics, ranging from plumbing pipes to exterior siding. Those burn hotter and generate smoke more toxic than wood does, exposing people to numerous hazardous chemicals. Researchers and health officials are confident  more people will get sick and many will die as regions such as the U.S. West see bigger, more intense wildfires. An estimated 20,000 premature deaths now occur annually in the U.S. due to chronic wildfire smoke exposure. That\u2019s expected to double by the end of the century, according to scientists funded by NASA, as tens of millions of people get exposed to massive \u201csmoke waves\u201d emanating from blazes in Western states. But while those forecasts help illustrate the profound impacts of a warming climate, they can\u2019t predict which fires will prove deadly and which individuals will develop lung ailments or other illnesses. One of relatively few long-term studies on the issue is under way at the California National Primate Research Center. Fifty rhesus monkeys living in outdoor pens year-round were exposed to a prolonged period of wildfire smoke as infants in 2008. They\u2019ve developed lungs 20% smaller than another group of monkeys born a year later, researchers found. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest animal model to replicate what happens with kids,\u201d said Lisa Miller, the center\u2019s associate director of research. The difference first showed up when the animals were adolescents, and has continued as they\u2019ve matured. It\u2019s impossible for the untrained eye to distinguish the smoke-exposed monkeys from hundreds of others that share their pens, but Miller\u2019s team next plans to investigate how the decreased lung function affects activity levels of the monkeys. As the animals age, any diseases they develop and how they die would give clues into the fate of humans heavily exposed to smoke. Studies of wildland firefighters also give insights into the risks of smoke inhalation. They\u2019ve shown significantly higher rates of lung cancer and death from heart disease, said Michael Kleinman, who researches the health effects of air pollution and is a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Irvine. Firefighters get much higher and more frequent doses of smoke, but Kleinman said a proportional increase in illnesses could be expected among the general public exposed to wildfire smoke across California and the West. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say there will probably more effects at the long-term level,\u201d Kleinman said. \u201cEspecially if those events happened over a longer period of time or more repeatedly, there will be cumulative damage to the lung and heart which eventually will lead to chronic disease.\u201d As she fled with her boyfriend ahead of the fire that destroyed Paradise on the morning of Nov. 8, 2018, Norton said the smoke was so thick \u201cit was like midnight.\u201d A few days later, she went back to work at a hospital in Chico, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) miles from Paradise. But smoke from the still-burning fire had made it inside the facility. There weren\u2019t enough face masks to go around so Norton said she went without one for several days. Initially she felt just a bit wheezy, as she had during the last major fire in the area about a decade earlier. But two weeks later she came down with a respiratory infection that brought fever and severe congestion. When that finally cleared, she got another, then another \u2014 eight or nine infections in all over the past year. \u201cI just want to break this cycle of sickness,\u201d she said. Norton says she never smoked, nor did her parents, and never had any respiratory issues prior to the fire. She missed so much work in the months after the fire that she got a warning from a supervisor. To try to keep from getting sick, she rinses out her sinuses regularly and takes antihistamines to reduce inflammation in her airways. She also avoids large gatherings, including skipping office parties and two weddings, out of fear that she could pick up a virus. She tries to eat healthy and reduce stress by seeing a counselor. Norton has been to a pulmonologist and two ear nose and throat doctors to little avail, and has been referred to a sinus specialist at Stanford University for further testing. The pulmonologist who initially treated her, Dinesh Verma, said he sees a \u201cdirect correlation\u201d between Norton\u2019s smoke exposure and her subsequent health struggles. \u201cThe logical explanation definitely would be that intense smoke, basically chemical exposure, did damage the airways to the extent that they\u2019re now more susceptible\u201d to infection, Verma said. Verma said virtually all of his hundreds of patients from Chico and Paradise had complications after the fire that required them to be hospitalized or treated. Most had preexisting conditions such as asthma and needed only a trigger to send them into a downward spiral. Predicting what will happen with otherwise-healthy patients like Norton is more difficult, he said. Norton is among about 9,000 people who responded to a health survey as part of a long-term health study of smoke exposure in Paradise and other California communities. The work is led by researchers at the University of California, Davis, who plan to track the lung health of a small number of those respondents in coming years by measuring their breathing capacity. They\u2019re also collaborating with Williams at the primate center to see if the decline seen in the rhesus monkeys has parallels for human infants. Dr. Nicholas Kenyon, a pulmonologist involved in the effort, said determining the health effects of smoke is increasingly urgent given the region\u2019s burgeoning population and more frequent fires due to climate change. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the population affected right now, but it\u2019s not going to be isolated to us. This is going to be the entire West,\u201d Kenyon said. \u201cNobody\u2019s been really inhaling this kind of stuff from structures until now.\u201d Another participant in the UC Davis study, 64-year-old Elizabeth Watling, lives in Chico and remained there through the fire so she could look after her 94-year-old aunt. She recalls smoke so thick that it left a layer of ash all over town, gray and light as snow. The air remained heavily polluted until it rained more than two weeks later. When she gardens or does other outdoor activities, Watling wears a mask because her throat has become so easily irritated by dust. She fiddles with it often, taking the mask on and off to talk, and wonders how effective it will be since she can fit her fingers through gaps along her cheeks. The health issues Watling blames on the smoke are less severe than Norton\u2019s \u2014 a scratchy throat that won\u2019t go away, coughs that linger, shortness of breath. She expected those to go away but they haven\u2019t. Watling now figures that, given her age, she won\u2019t ever fully recover and the smoke could shave years off her life. \u201cI don\u2019t think the news is good for me,\u201d she said. ___ Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter: @MatthewBrownAP ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Molly Crosby, a 32-year-old mother of five, had been dealing with bouts of coughing and congestion all summer. Some preliminary exams in Green Bay showed a spot on her right lung. That led the Crosbys to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for additional tests. A carcinoid endocrine tumor was found. The tumor isn\u2019t as dangerous as other forms of cancer but was disconcerting for an otherwise healthy, nonsmoker. \u201cWe found out the day before we reported to camp,\u201d Crosby said on Wednesday. \u201cWe were at Mayo the two or three days leading up to training camp, when they did all their scans and got the final prognosis.\u201d Crosby flew back to Green Bay for the start of training camp. After a subpar 2018 season, Crosby had to beat out Sam Ficken. Crosby managed to keep his focus and retained the job for a 13th season. \u201cI\u2019ve trained a long time in compartmentalizing different situations,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cWhenever I was home, I was fully home. The organization was unbelievable through training camp, just giving me time to be with Molly and be with the family and help where I could throughout the day and evening. I just tried to be fully in on both things. I have felt a lot of freedom in this. \u201cI love doing what I\u2019m doing but the importance of taking care of family and being there for Molly and the kids, when I look back on it, it was a special camp. I was able to really fully immerse in both things. It was nerve-wracking, too. Day in and day out, it was coming in, having to work and compete at a high level, and then going home and flowing back into a normal routine. Then, we\u2019d sit down at night and you\u2019d remember that surgery was coming and Molly had cancer. Those things were heavy.\u201d That surgery was at the end of the preseason, with part of Molly\u2019s right lung removed. While she will go back to Mayo for a scan in mid-October, Crosby said the doctors are positive they got rid of the tumor and she will not require radiation or chemotherapy. Since 2009, the NFL has held its annual \u201cCrucial Catch\u201d campaign to raise money for the American Cancer Society. It was a campaign that had already hit home for Crosby. A grandmother died of breast cancer and a sister-in-law is in her third year battling ovarian cancer.

Don\u2019t take it for granted. The numbers, with our technology, are amazing with prevention but treating it if you catch it early enough. That\u2019s one of the big things is pushing that.

{"claim_id":"7197","hypothesis":"Health care, Trump among diverse stands of Colorado hopefuls.","explanation_1":"Republican treasurer Walker Stapleton has attacked his opponent in the race for Colorado governor, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, as too radical and extreme for the rapidly growing state as the GOP tries to prevent a complete Democratic takeover of the Statehouse.","premise":"Stapleton\u2019s repeated criticism of the liberal Polis underscores Republican fears that the party could lose control of the state Senate in Tuesday\u2019s election. The Senate has acted as a check on attempts by the Democratic-led House to restrict gun rights and raise taxes for public schools. \u201cColorado does not want a socialist for governor,\u201d Stapleton declared when Polis, an advocate of universal health care, campaigned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders last month. In response, Polis cites a high-tech entrepreneurial career that made him wealthy before he entered Congress in 2009 and has let him personally invest more than $22 million in his campaign this year. Polis and his supporters largely view the race as a referendum on President Donald Trump, whom Stapleton has embraced. Trump\u2019s efforts to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law top the list of issues. \u201cHealth care is on the ballot. Social Security and Medicare are on the ballot,\u201d Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told activists while campaigning with Polis at Servicios de la Raza, a Denver community center. \u201cYou need guardrails here in Colorado.\u201d Colorado Republicans haven\u2019t held the governor\u2019s seat since 2007. Early returns suggest Stapleton, 44, is the underdog in an election in which independents, the state\u2019s largest voting bloc, are turning out in high numbers, as they did in Colorado\u2019s Democratic primaries. If elected, Polis, 43, would be Colorado\u2019s first openly gay governor. A Democratic-controlled Statehouse could move forward on gun regulations, expand public school funding and limit drilling options for Colorado\u2019s $31 billion oil and gas industry \u2014 one that\u2019s prospered under centrist Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, a former petroleum geologist who is term-limited. Colorado\u2019s Republican-led Senate has forced compromise on those issues. Senate President Kevin Grantham credits that compromise for the state\u2019s fast-growing economy, one of the strongest in the nation. \u201cThat balance of government is good for predictability and stability and steady sailing for businesses,\u201d Grantham said.

A cluster of races in Denver\u2019s suburbs will determine the outcome, and they have attracted money from the national parties and outside groups.

Stapleton has attacked Polis\u2019 advocacy of green energy and publicly funded preschool and kindergarten. He defends state constitutional limits on taxes and spending that require voter approval for any tax hike. As treasurer, Stapleton worked with both parties to ensure a stable state investment portfolio and to rescue an underfunded state pension fund. He claims Polis\u2019 plans for fully funded preschool and kindergarten and universal health care coverage would triple Colorado\u2019s budget \u2014 if Polis could raise the taxes to fund them. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that if you ask people to pay for things, you have to explain how you\u2019re actually going to fund government, health care, transportation,\u201d Stapleton said. Polis pledges to \u201cbuild coalitions\u201d to fund transportation and schools and promote green energy investment \u2014 suggesting that restrictive tax laws eventually need to change in a state whose population has grown from 4.3 million in 2000 to an estimated 5.7 million this year. Polis called for restricting access to guns for those in crisis and urged voters to elect a governor who supports abortion rights.

In addition,\u00a0the story clearly states that this study was done on patients at low risk, that is, those with stable heart disease. However, while the story does describe the cost of stenting, it does not provide the cost of the medication for comparison.

REUTERS\/Toby Melville The GlaxoSmithKline Plc vaccine Rotarix fights infection with the rotavirus, which causes about 55,000 hospitalizations in U.S. children each year and kills more than 600,000 children worldwide, mostly in developing countries. Rotarix already is approved in more than 100 other countries throughout the world. The vaccine competes with Merck & Co Inc\u2019s rotavirus vaccine called RotaTeq. Without vaccination, nearly every child in the United States likely would be infected at least once with rotavirus by age five, the Food and Drug Administration said. In studies of more than 24,000 infants, Rotarix prevented severe and mild cases of rotavirus-caused diarrhea and vomiting during the first two years of life. \u201cThis vaccine provides another option to combat and reduce a potentially severe illness that affects so many children,\u201d Dr. Jesse Goodman, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement announcing the Rotarix approval. The most common reactions reported during clinical trials were fussiness, irritability, cough, runny nose, fever, loss of appetite and vomiting, the FDA said. An earlier oral rotavirus vaccine sold by Wyeth was pulled from the market in 1999 after it was linked to a rare, life-threatening type of bowel obstruction known as intussusception. In a Glaxo study of more than 63,000 infants, there was no increase in the problem compared with a placebo. Higher rates of convulsion and pneumonia-related deaths were seen in Rotarix patients in that study but not in other Glaxo trials. \u201cAlthough the FDA has concluded that the available data do not establish that these events are related to the vaccine, the agency has requested the manufacturer to conduct post-marketing safety studies involving more than 40,000 infants to provide additional safety information,\u201d the FDA said. Glaxo said Rotarix \u201cwill offer protection against the most commonly circulating rotavirus types in the U.S. and allow infants to complete the vaccination series by four months of age.\u201d   Rotarix, which is a liquid, is given in two doses to infants from six to 24 weeks of age, the FDA said. Merck\u2019s RotaTeq vaccine is administered in three doses from ages six weeks to 32 weeks. Sales of Rotarix were $182 million in 2007 and are expected to rise with approval in the large U.S. market. The vaccine will be commercially available in the United States in the second half of the year, Glaxo said. Also on Thursday, researchers reported that Rotarix provided protection for up to two years in a study of infants from 10 Latin American countries. The Glaxo-funded trial of more than 15,000 infants found severe diarrhea from rotavirus in 0.4 percent of children given the vaccine, compared with 2.3 percent in the placebo group. Results were published in the Lancet medical journal. The arrival of a new generation of oral vaccines against the disease has been welcomed by health-care workers, but some experts caution against assuming the vaccines will work equally well in all countries. In a commentary in the Lancet, Australian pediatric experts Keith Grimwood and Carl Kirkwood noted Rotarix was more effective in European trials than in middle-income Latin American countries.

Worldwide, 40 percent of children, 33 percent of non-smoking men and 35 percent non-smoking women were exposed to second-hand smoke in 2004, they found.

{"claim_id":"33977","hypothesis":"Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm delivered a speech on the perils of multiculturalism.","explanation_1":"Both Governor Lamm and the writer of the e-mail misidentified the author of the book Mexifornia, whose correct name is Victor Davis Hanson:","premise":"Richard D. Lamm was a Democrat who served as governor of Colorado for twelve years from 1975 to 1987. In 2005, a third-person account of a speech attributed to him, on the perils of multiculturalism, became a viral item online:  A Frightening Analysis We all know Dick Lamm as the former Governor of Colorado. In that context his thoughts are particularly poignant. Last week there was an immigration-overpopulation conference in Washington, DC, filled to capacity by many of American\u2019s finest minds and leaders. A brilliant college professor named Victor Hansen Davis talked about his latest book, \u201cMexifornia,\u201d explaining how immigration \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 was destroying the entire state of California. He said it would march across the country until it destroyed all vestiges of The American Dream. Moments later, former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm stood up and gave a stunning speech on how to destroy America. The audience sat spellbound as he described eight methods for the destruction of the United States. He said, \u201cIf you believe that America is too smug, too self-satisfied, too rich, then let\u2019s destroy America. It is not that hard to do. No nation in history has survived the ravages of time. Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall and that \u2018An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide. '\u201d \u201cHere is how they do it,\u201d Lamm said:  First to destroy America, \u201cTurn America into a bilingual or multi-lingual and bicultural country. History shows that no nation can survive the tension, conflict, and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures. It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a society to be bilingual. The historical scholar Seymour Lipset put it this way: \u2018The histories of bilingual and bi-cultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension, and tragedy. Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, Lebanon all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons, and Corsicans.\u201d Lamm went on:  Second, to destroy America, \u201cInvent \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 and encourage immigrants to maintain their culture. I would make it an article of belief that all cultures are equal. That there are no cultural differences. I would make it an article of faith that the Black and Hispanic dropout rates are due to prejudice and discrimination by the majority. Every other explanation is out of bounds. Third, \u201cWe could make the United States a \u2018Hispanic Quebec\u2019 without much effort. The key is to celebrate diversity rather than unity. As Benjamin Schwarz said in the Atlantic Monthly recently: \u2018The apparent success of our own multiethnic and multicultural experiment might have been achieved! Not by tolerance but by hegemony. Without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentrically and what it meant to be an American, we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together. '\u201d Lamm said, \u201cI would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture. I would replace the melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl metaphor. It is important to ensure that we have various cultural subgroups living in America reinforcing their differences rather than as Americans, emphasizing their similarities.\u201d   \u201cFourth, I would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated. I would add a second underclass, unassimilated, undereducated, and antagonistic to our population. I would have this second underclass have a 50% dropout rate from high school.\u201d \u201cMy fifth point for destroying America would be to get big foundations and business to give these efforts lots of money. I would invest in ethnic identity, and I would establish the cult of \u2018Victimology.\u2019 I would get all minorities to think their lack of success was the fault of the majority. I would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority population.\u201d \u201cMy sixth plan for America\u2019s downfall would include dual citizenship and promote divided loyalties. I would celebrate diversity over unity. I would stress differences rather than similarities. Diverse people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other \u2013 that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent. People undervalue the unity! Unity is what it takes to keep a nation together. Look at the ancient Greeks. The Greeks believed that they belonged to the same race; they possessed a common language and literature; and they worshiped the same gods. All Greece took part in the Olympic Games. A common enemy Persia threatened their liberty. Yet all these bonds were not strong enough to over come two factors: local patriotism and geographical conditions that nurtured political divisions. Greece fell. \u201cE. Pluribus Unum\u201d \u2014 From many, one. In that historical reality, if we put the emphasis on the \u2018pluribus\u2019 instead of the \u2018Unum,\u2019 we can balkanize America as surely as Kosovo.\u201d \u201cNext to last, I would place all subjects off limits ~ make it taboo to talk about anything against the cult of \u2018diversity.\u2019 I would find a word similar to \u2018heretic\u2019 in the 16th century \u2013 that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking. Words like \u2018racist\u2019 or \u2018x! xenophobes\u2019 halt discussion and debate.\u201d \u201cHaving made America a bilingual\/bicultural country, having established multi-culturism, having the large foundations fund the doctrine of \u2018Victimology,\u2019 I would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws. I would develop a mantra: That because immigration has been good for America, it must always be good. I would make every individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative impact of millions of them.\u201d  In the last minute of his speech, Governor Lamm wiped his brow. Profound silence followed. Finally he said, \u201cLastly, I would censor Victor Hanson Davis\u2019s book  Mexifornia. His book is dangerous. It exposes the plan to destroy America. If you feel America deserves to be destroyed, don\u2019t read that book.\u201d There was no applause. A chilling fear quietly rose like an ominous cloud above every attendee at the conference. Every American in that room knew that everything Lamm enumerated was proceeding methodically, quietly, darkly, yet pervasively across the United States today. Every discussion is being suppressed. Over 100 languages are ripping the foundation of our educational system and national cohesiveness. Barbaric cultures that practice female genital mutilation are growing as we celebrate \u2018diversity.\u2019  American jobs are vanishing into the Third World as corporations create a Third World in America \u2014 take note of California and other states \u2014 to date, ten million illegal aliens and growing fast. It is reminiscent of George Orwell\u2019s book \u201c1984.\u201d In that story, three slogans are engraved in the Ministry of Truth building:   \u201cWar is peace,\u201d \u201cFreedom is slavery,\u201d and  \u201cIgnorance is strength.\u201d Governor Lamm walked back to his seat. It dawned on everyone at the conference that our nation and the future of this great democracy are deeply in trouble and worsening fast. If we don\u2019t get this immigration monster stopped within three years, it will rage like a California wildfire and destroy everything in its path, especially The American Dream. Lamm told us in mid-June 2005 that this text represented a reasonably accurate account of a speech he had given a few years earlier:  Yes, it is a speech I gave a year and a half ago in Washington D.C. It was a 5 minute speech, and I am amazed and gratified it has received so much coverage. He also passed along to us the following \u201crevised version\u201d of his speech:   I HAVE A SECRET PLAN TO DESTROY AMERICA. IF YOU BELIEVE, AS MANY DO, THAT AMERICA IS TOO SMUG, TOO WHITE BREAD, TOO SELF-SATISFIED, TOO RICH, LETS DESTROY AMERICA. IT IS NOT THAT HARD TO DO. HISTORY SHOWS THAT NATIONS ARE MORE FRAGILE THAN THEIR CITIZENS THINK. NO NATION IN HISTORY HAS SURVIVED THE RAVAGES OF TIME. ARNOLD TOYNBEE OBSERVED THAT ALL GREAT CIVILIZATIONS RISE AND THEY ALL FALL, AND THAT \u201cAN AUTOPSY OF HISTORY WOULD SHOW THAT ALL GREAT NATIONS COMMIT SUICIDE.\u201d  HERE IS MY PLAN: I. WE MUST FIRST MAKE AMERICA A BILINGUAL-BICULTURAL COUNTRY. HISTORY SHOWS, IN MY OPINION, THAT NO NATION CAN SURVIVE THE TENSION, CONFLICT, AND ANTAGONISM OF TWO COMPETING LANGUAGES AND CULTURES. IT IS A BLESSING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE BILINGUAL; IT IS A CURSE FOR A SOCIETY TO BE BILINGUAL. ONE SCHOLAR, SEYMOUR MARTIN LIPSET, PUT IT THIS WAY: THE HISTORIES OF BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL SOCIETIES THAT DO NOT ASSIMILATE ARE HISTORIES OF TURMOIL, TENSION, AND TRAGEDY. CANADA, BELGIUM, MALAYSIA, LEBANON-ALL FACE CRISES OF NATIONAL EXISTENCE IN WHICH MINORITIES PRESS FOR AUTONOMY, IF NOT INDEPENDENCE. PAKISTAN AND CYPRUS HAVE DIVIDED. NIGERIA SUPPRESSED AN ETHNIC REBELLION. FRANCE FACES DIFFICULTIES WITH ITS BASQUES, BRETONS, AND CORSICANS. II. I WOULD THEN INVENT \u201cMULTICULTURALISM\u201d AND ENCOURAGE IMMIGRANTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CULTURE. I WOULD MAKE IT AN ARTICLE OF BELIEF THAT ALL CULTURES ARE EQUAL:  THAT THERE ARE NO CULTURAL DIFFERENCES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. I WOULD DECLARE IT AN ARTICLE OF FAITH THAT THE BLACK AND HISPANIC DROPOUT RATE IS ONLY DUE TO PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION BY THE MAJORITY. EVERY OTHER EXPLANATION IS OUT-OF-BOUNDS. III. WE CAN MAKE THE UNITED STATES A \u201cHISPANIC QUEBEC\u201d WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT. THE KEY IS TO CELEBRATE DIVERSITY RATHER THAN UNITY. AS BENJAMIN SCHWARZ SAID IN THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY RECENTLY: \u2026THE APPARENT SUCCESS OF OUR OWN MULTIETHNIC AND MULTICULTURAL EXPERIMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED NOT BY TOLERANCE BUT BY HEGEMONY. WITHOUT THE DOMINANCE THAT ONCE DICTATED ETHNOCENTRICALLY, AND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN AMERICAN, WE ARE LEFT WITH ONLY TOLERANCE AND PLURALISM TO HOLD US TOGETHER. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL IMMIGRANTS TO KEEP THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. I WOULD REPLACE THE MELTING POT METAPHOR WITH A SALAD BOWL METAPHOR. IT IS IMPORTANT TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE VARIOUS CULTURAL SUB-GROUPS LIVING IN AMERICA REINFORCING THEIR DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN AMERICANS, EMPHASIZING THEIR SIMILARITIES. IV. HAVING DONE ALL THIS, I WOULD MAKE OUR FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THE LEAST EDUCATED \u2013 I WOULD ADD A SECOND UNDERCLASS, UNASSIMILATED, UNDEREDUCATED, AND ANTAGONISTIC TO OUR POPULATION. I WOULD HAVE THIS SECOND UNDERCLASS HAVE A 50% DROP OUT RATE FROM SCHOOL. V. \u00a0 I WOULD THEN GET THE BIG FOUNDATIONS AND BIG BUSINESS TO GIVE THESE EFFORTS LOTS OF MONEY. I WOULD INVEST IN ETHNIC IDENTITY, AND I WOULD ESTABLISH THE CULT OF VICTIMOLOGY. I WOULD GET ALL MINORITIES TO THINK THEIR LACK OF SUCCESS WAS ALL THE FAULT OF THE MAJORITY \u2013 I WOULD START A GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY BLAMING ALL MINORITY FAILURE ON THE MAJORITY POPULATION. VI. I WOULD ESTABLISH DUAL CITIZENSHIP AND PROMOTE DIVIDED LOYALTIES. I WOULD \u201cCELEBRATE DIVERSITY.\u201d \u201cDIVERSITY\u201d IS A WONDERFULLY SEDUCTIVE WORD. IT STRESSES DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN COMMONALITIES. DIVERSE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE ARE MOSTLY ENGAGED IN HATING EACH OTHER-THAT IS, WHEN THEY ARE NOT KILLING EACH OTHER. A DIVERSE,\u201d PEACEFUL, OR STABLE SOCIETY IS AGAINST MOST HISTORICAL PRECEDENT. PEOPLE UNDERVALUE THE UNITY IT TAKES TO KEEP A NATION TOGETHER, AND WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MYOPIA. LOOK AT THE ANCIENT GREEKS. DORF\u2019S WORLD HISTORY TELLS US: THE GREEKS BELIEVED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE SAME RACE; THEY POSSESSED A COMMON LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE; AND THEY WORSHIPED THE SAME GODS.

An audio recording of Lamm\u2019s speech from 18 October 2003 is now available online:","label":0,"__index_level_0__":7062,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"Richard D. Lamm was a Democrat who served as governor of Colorado for twelve years from 1975 to 1987. In 2005, a third-person account of a speech attributed to him, on the perils of multiculturalism, became a viral item online:  A Frightening Analysis We all know Dick Lamm as the former Governor of Colorado. In that context his thoughts are particularly poignant. Last week there was an immigration-overpopulation conference in Washington, DC, filled to capacity by many of American\u2019s finest minds and leaders. A brilliant college professor named Victor Hansen Davis talked about his latest book, \u201cMexifornia,\u201d explaining how immigration \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 was destroying the entire state of California. He said it would march across the country until it destroyed all vestiges of The American Dream. Moments later, former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm stood up and gave a stunning speech on how to destroy America. The audience sat spellbound as he described eight methods for the destruction of the United States. He said, \u201cIf you believe that America is too smug, too self-satisfied, too rich, then let\u2019s destroy America. It is not that hard to do. No nation in history has survived the ravages of time. Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall and that \u2018An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide. '\u201d \u201cHere is how they do it,\u201d Lamm said:  First to destroy America, \u201cTurn America into a bilingual or multi-lingual and bicultural country. History shows that no nation can survive the tension, conflict, and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures. It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a society to be bilingual. The historical scholar Seymour Lipset put it this way: \u2018The histories of bilingual and bi-cultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension, and tragedy. Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, Lebanon all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons, and Corsicans.\u201d Lamm went on:  Second, to destroy America, \u201cInvent \u2018multiculturalism\u2019 and encourage immigrants to maintain their culture. I would make it an article of belief that all cultures are equal. That there are no cultural differences. I would make it an article of faith that the Black and Hispanic dropout rates are due to prejudice and discrimination by the majority. Every other explanation is out of bounds. Third, \u201cWe could make the United States a \u2018Hispanic Quebec\u2019 without much effort. The key is to celebrate diversity rather than unity. As Benjamin Schwarz said in the Atlantic Monthly recently: \u2018The apparent success of our own multiethnic and multicultural experiment might have been achieved! Not by tolerance but by hegemony. Without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentrically and what it meant to be an American, we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together. '\u201d Lamm said, \u201cI would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture. I would replace the melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl metaphor. It is important to ensure that we have various cultural subgroups living in America reinforcing their differences rather than as Americans, emphasizing their similarities.\u201d   \u201cFourth, I would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated. I would add a second underclass, unassimilated, undereducated, and antagonistic to our population. I would have this second underclass have a 50% dropout rate from high school.\u201d \u201cMy fifth point for destroying America would be to get big foundations and business to give these efforts lots of money. I would invest in ethnic identity, and I would establish the cult of \u2018Victimology.\u2019 I would get all minorities to think their lack of success was the fault of the majority. I would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority population.\u201d \u201cMy sixth plan for America\u2019s downfall would include dual citizenship and promote divided loyalties. I would celebrate diversity over unity. I would stress differences rather than similarities. Diverse people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other \u2013 that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent. People undervalue the unity! Unity is what it takes to keep a nation together. Look at the ancient Greeks. The Greeks believed that they belonged to the same race; they possessed a common language and literature; and they worshiped the same gods. All Greece took part in the Olympic Games. A common enemy Persia threatened their liberty. Yet all these bonds were not strong enough to over come two factors: local patriotism and geographical conditions that nurtured political divisions. Greece fell. \u201cE. Pluribus Unum\u201d \u2014 From many, one. In that historical reality, if we put the emphasis on the \u2018pluribus\u2019 instead of the \u2018Unum,\u2019 we can balkanize America as surely as Kosovo.\u201d \u201cNext to last, I would place all subjects off limits ~ make it taboo to talk about anything against the cult of \u2018diversity.\u2019 I would find a word similar to \u2018heretic\u2019 in the 16th century \u2013 that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking. Words like \u2018racist\u2019 or \u2018x! xenophobes\u2019 halt discussion and debate.\u201d \u201cHaving made America a bilingual\/bicultural country, having established multi-culturism, having the large foundations fund the doctrine of \u2018Victimology,\u2019 I would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws. I would develop a mantra: That because immigration has been good for America, it must always be good. I would make every individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative impact of millions of them.\u201d  In the last minute of his speech, Governor Lamm wiped his brow. Profound silence followed. Finally he said, \u201cLastly, I would censor Victor Hanson Davis\u2019s book  Mexifornia. His book is dangerous. It exposes the plan to destroy America. If you feel America deserves to be destroyed, don\u2019t read that book.\u201d There was no applause. A chilling fear quietly rose like an ominous cloud above every attendee at the conference. Every American in that room knew that everything Lamm enumerated was proceeding methodically, quietly, darkly, yet pervasively across the United States today. Every discussion is being suppressed. Over 100 languages are ripping the foundation of our educational system and national cohesiveness. Barbaric cultures that practice female genital mutilation are growing as we celebrate \u2018diversity.\u2019  American jobs are vanishing into the Third World as corporations create a Third World in America \u2014 take note of California and other states \u2014 to date, ten million illegal aliens and growing fast. It is reminiscent of George Orwell\u2019s book \u201c1984.\u201d In that story, three slogans are engraved in the Ministry of Truth building:   \u201cWar is peace,\u201d \u201cFreedom is slavery,\u201d and  \u201cIgnorance is strength.\u201d Governor Lamm walked back to his seat. It dawned on everyone at the conference that our nation and the future of this great democracy are deeply in trouble and worsening fast. If we don\u2019t get this immigration monster stopped within three years, it will rage like a California wildfire and destroy everything in its path, especially The American Dream. Lamm told us in mid-June 2005 that this text represented a reasonably accurate account of a speech he had given a few years earlier:  Yes, it is a speech I gave a year and a half ago in Washington D.C. It was a 5 minute speech, and I am amazed and gratified it has received so much coverage. He also passed along to us the following \u201crevised version\u201d of his speech:   I HAVE A SECRET PLAN TO DESTROY AMERICA. IF YOU BELIEVE, AS MANY DO, THAT AMERICA IS TOO SMUG, TOO WHITE BREAD, TOO SELF-SATISFIED, TOO RICH, LETS DESTROY AMERICA. IT IS NOT THAT HARD TO DO. HISTORY SHOWS THAT NATIONS ARE MORE FRAGILE THAN THEIR CITIZENS THINK. NO NATION IN HISTORY HAS SURVIVED THE RAVAGES OF TIME. ARNOLD TOYNBEE OBSERVED THAT ALL GREAT CIVILIZATIONS RISE AND THEY ALL FALL, AND THAT \u201cAN AUTOPSY OF HISTORY WOULD SHOW THAT ALL GREAT NATIONS COMMIT SUICIDE.\u201d  HERE IS MY PLAN: I. WE MUST FIRST MAKE AMERICA A BILINGUAL-BICULTURAL COUNTRY. HISTORY SHOWS, IN MY OPINION, THAT NO NATION CAN SURVIVE THE TENSION, CONFLICT, AND ANTAGONISM OF TWO COMPETING LANGUAGES AND CULTURES. IT IS A BLESSING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE BILINGUAL; IT IS A CURSE FOR A SOCIETY TO BE BILINGUAL. ONE SCHOLAR, SEYMOUR MARTIN LIPSET, PUT IT THIS WAY: THE HISTORIES OF BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL SOCIETIES THAT DO NOT ASSIMILATE ARE HISTORIES OF TURMOIL, TENSION, AND TRAGEDY. CANADA, BELGIUM, MALAYSIA, LEBANON-ALL FACE CRISES OF NATIONAL EXISTENCE IN WHICH MINORITIES PRESS FOR AUTONOMY, IF NOT INDEPENDENCE. PAKISTAN AND CYPRUS HAVE DIVIDED. NIGERIA SUPPRESSED AN ETHNIC REBELLION. FRANCE FACES DIFFICULTIES WITH ITS BASQUES, BRETONS, AND CORSICANS. II. I WOULD THEN INVENT \u201cMULTICULTURALISM\u201d AND ENCOURAGE IMMIGRANTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CULTURE. I WOULD MAKE IT AN ARTICLE OF BELIEF THAT ALL CULTURES ARE EQUAL:  THAT THERE ARE NO CULTURAL DIFFERENCES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. I WOULD DECLARE IT AN ARTICLE OF FAITH THAT THE BLACK AND HISPANIC DROPOUT RATE IS ONLY DUE TO PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION BY THE MAJORITY. EVERY OTHER EXPLANATION IS OUT-OF-BOUNDS. III. WE CAN MAKE THE UNITED STATES A \u201cHISPANIC QUEBEC\u201d WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT. THE KEY IS TO CELEBRATE DIVERSITY RATHER THAN UNITY. AS BENJAMIN SCHWARZ SAID IN THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY RECENTLY: \u2026THE APPARENT SUCCESS OF OUR OWN MULTIETHNIC AND MULTICULTURAL EXPERIMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED NOT BY TOLERANCE BUT BY HEGEMONY. WITHOUT THE DOMINANCE THAT ONCE DICTATED ETHNOCENTRICALLY, AND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN AMERICAN, WE ARE LEFT WITH ONLY TOLERANCE AND PLURALISM TO HOLD US TOGETHER. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL IMMIGRANTS TO KEEP THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. I WOULD REPLACE THE MELTING POT METAPHOR WITH A SALAD BOWL METAPHOR. IT IS IMPORTANT TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE VARIOUS CULTURAL SUB-GROUPS LIVING IN AMERICA REINFORCING THEIR DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN AMERICANS, EMPHASIZING THEIR SIMILARITIES. IV. HAVING DONE ALL THIS, I WOULD MAKE OUR FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THE LEAST EDUCATED \u2013 I WOULD ADD A SECOND UNDERCLASS, UNASSIMILATED, UNDEREDUCATED, AND ANTAGONISTIC TO OUR POPULATION. I WOULD HAVE THIS SECOND UNDERCLASS HAVE A 50% DROP OUT RATE FROM SCHOOL. V. \u00a0 I WOULD THEN GET THE BIG FOUNDATIONS AND BIG BUSINESS TO GIVE THESE EFFORTS LOTS OF MONEY. I WOULD INVEST IN ETHNIC IDENTITY, AND I WOULD ESTABLISH THE CULT OF VICTIMOLOGY. I WOULD GET ALL MINORITIES TO THINK THEIR LACK OF SUCCESS WAS ALL THE FAULT OF THE MAJORITY \u2013 I WOULD START A GRIEVANCE INDUSTRY BLAMING ALL MINORITY FAILURE ON THE MAJORITY POPULATION. VI. I WOULD ESTABLISH DUAL CITIZENSHIP AND PROMOTE DIVIDED LOYALTIES. I WOULD \u201cCELEBRATE DIVERSITY.\u201d \u201cDIVERSITY\u201d IS A WONDERFULLY SEDUCTIVE WORD. IT STRESSES DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN COMMONALITIES. DIVERSE PEOPLE WORLDWIDE ARE MOSTLY ENGAGED IN HATING EACH OTHER-THAT IS, WHEN THEY ARE NOT KILLING EACH OTHER. A DIVERSE,\u201d PEACEFUL, OR STABLE SOCIETY IS AGAINST MOST HISTORICAL PRECEDENT. PEOPLE UNDERVALUE THE UNITY IT TAKES TO KEEP A NATION TOGETHER, AND WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS MYOPIA. LOOK AT THE ANCIENT GREEKS. DORF\u2019S WORLD HISTORY TELLS US: THE GREEKS BELIEVED THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE SAME RACE; THEY POSSESSED A COMMON LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE; AND THEY WORSHIPED THE SAME GODS. ALL GREECE TOOK PART IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN HONOR OF ZEUS AND ALL GREEKS VENERATED THE SHRINE OF APOLLO AT DELPHI. A COMMON ENEMY PERSIA THREATENED THEIR LIBERTY. YET, ALL OF THESE BONDS TOGETHER WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME TWO FACTORS . . . (LOCAL PATRIOTISM AND GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS THAT NURTURED POLITICAL DIVISIONS \u2026) IF WE CAN PUT THE EMPHASIS ON THE \u201cPLURIBUS,\u201d INSTEAD OF THE \u201cUNUM,\u201d WE CAN BALKANIZE AMERICA AS SURELY AS KOSOVO.

This speech, which he later described as a \"5 minute speech\" given about a year and a half prior to 2005 in Washington D.C., became widely known and discussed, particularly for its controversial content and stark portrayal of the consequences of divisive multicultural policies. The speech was confirmed by Lamm himself, who acknowledged its coverage and the reactions it received. Thus, the claim about his delivering a speech on the perils of multiculturalism is supported by his own acknowledgment and the content of the speech itself."}

This practice seems extremely unlikely because the tip of the needle could break off if one tried to stab it through a toilet paper roll. I\u2019m\u00a0not sure why someone would risk that if what they wanted was to use the same needle for another shot. Logically it would be much easier to wipe off the tip with some toilet paper rather than stabbing it through the roll. Here is the info on how someone would properly clean a needle\/syringe.

{"claim_id":"34360","hypothesis":"Bill Clinton was expelled from Oxford University for raping a British classmate named Eileen Wellstone.","explanation_1":"All in all, the rumors about Bill Clinton\u2019s having been expelled from Oxford over a rape allegation appear to have stemmed from a single uncorroborated, anonymous second-hand report published on a web site of dubious repute in 1999, combined with mere speculation about Clinton\u2019s having departed Oxford prior to the completion of a full two-year course of study. We haven\u2019t yet turned up anything that would counter the notion that the \u201cEileen Wellstone\u201d claim was simply a fabrication made up in 1999.","premise":"As the 2016 presidential campaign closed in on the finish line, the Washington Post published an eleven-year-old tape of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s making controversial remarks about women. The inevitable partisan rancor that ensued largely targeted the behavior Bill Clinton, husband of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, including the repetition of rumors that he had been expelled from Oxford University in 1969 for raping classmate Eileen Wellstone. The allegations weren\u2019t new \u2014 Republican opposition research strategist Roger Stone had tweeted about them a year earlier: In 1969, Bill Clinton was expelled from Oxford for raping nineteen\u00ad-year\u00ad-old Eileen Wellstone.\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/sxR2lCRQ2w \u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 13, 2015  The backdrop for these rumors was that just prior to his graduation from Georgetown University, Bill Clinton won a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, for two years and headed off to England for the 1968-69 academic term \u2014 but he returned to the United States before finishing out the full two-year course of study. In October 1992, during Bill Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign, a British news report included interviews with a number of Clinton\u2019s Oxford classmates. The article described Clinton\u2019s truncated study trajectory at Oxford as one that was disrupted by the Vietnam-era draft, not by penalties for misbehavior. Had Clinton left Oxford under dubious circumstances, reporting on such a scoop just prior to the presidential election of 1992 would have been irresistible for the British (and American) press. But Clinton\u2019s classmates made absolutely no mention of his departing abruptly or in disgrace: Clinton never completed his degree. In part this was due to his worry about the draft. According to one contemporary, he thought his first year would be his last and so there was little point in doing the work for a two-year degree; in his second year it was too late to start. This was not seen to matter. Many American Rhodes scholars treated their time at Oxford as a version of the Grand Tour. They had their degree and planned to go to law school when they returned to the US; Oxford was an interesting interlude. Clinton\u2019s non-completion of the scholar program at Oxford was public knowledge more than 20 years prior to the origination of rumors that he had been expelled from that university for sexual misconduct. And as documented in a separate article on this site, Clinton\u2019s efforts to avoid the military draft (ostensibly by joining the ROTC at the University of Arkansas) were the likely reason behind the timing of his movements between the U.S. and England. Nonetheless, by June 2004 the Eileen Wellstone rape allegation had appeared in the  Washington Times, published in an article that lacked an author, a citation, or any other information supporting the claim: Bill Clinton calls his sexual encounters with White House intern Monica Lewinsky \u201cimmoral and foolish\u201d and said his \u201crelationship\u201d with Gennifer Flowers was one he \u201cshould not have had.\u201d But in his autobiography flying out of bookstores, he doesn\u2019t mention several other women whose names were linked in scandal with his \u2026 He is less forthcoming about, or does not mention, other women who say they were either sexually involved with him, or that they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. These include: \u2013\u00a0Eileen Wellstone, an English woman who said Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near Oxford University where Mr. Clinton was a student in 1969. Although often unattributed, the claim appears to have originated with a February 1999 article on Capitol Hill Blue (a web site known for publishing dubious information at that time). That primary iteration (since deleted) mentioned nothing about Clinton\u2019s having been expelled from Oxford, but it alleged \u2014 based on a second-hand report from an anonymous source \u2014 that Wellstone had accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her during his time at Oxford: Eileen Wellstone, 19-year-old English woman, said Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near the Oxford where the future President was a student in 1969. A retired State Department employee, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that he spoke with the family of the girl and filed a report with his superiors. Clinton admitted having sex with the girl, but claimed it was consensual. The victim\u2019s family declined to pursue the case. In an interview with Capitol Hill Blue, the retired State Department employee said he believed the story Miss Wellstone, the young English woman who said Clinton raped her in 1969. \u201cThere was no doubt in my mind that this young woman had suffered severe emotional trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we were under tremendous pressure to avoid the embarrassment of having a Rhodes Scholar charged with rape. I filed a report with my superiors and that was the last I heard of it.\u201d Miss Wellstone, who is now married and lives near London, confirmed the incident when contacted, but refused to discuss the matter further. She said she would not go public with further details of the attack. Afterwards, she changed her phone number and hired a barrister who warned a reporter to stay away from his client. In his book, Unlimited Access, former FBI agent Gary Aldrich reported that Clinton left Oxford University for a \u201cEuropean Tour\u201d in 1969 and was told by University officials that he was no longer welcome there. Aldrich said Clinton\u2019s academic record at Oxford was lackluster. Clinton later accepted a scholarship for Yale Law School and did not complete his studies at Oxford. Oxford officials refused comment. The State Department also refused to comment on the incident. A Freedom of Information request filed by Capitol Hill Blue failed to turn up any records of the incident. This account doesn\u2019t jibe with the timeline established in our own research and stated elsewhere, which has Clinton in the United States (not on a \u201cEuropean tour\u201d) during the summer of 1969, and then returning to England for his second year at Oxford (rather than being told \u201che was no longer welcome there\u201d) where he remained at least as late as January 1970:  In his second year at Oxford, Clinton shared a house at 46 Leckford Road with Aller, Strobe Talbot, now an editor at Time, and David Satter, now a judge in Massachusetts. Mandy Merck, now lecturing on feminist writing in New York, arrived at Oxford as an American graduate student in 1969. She met Clinton in her second term and recalls going with him and Sara Maitland, in January 1970, to hear Germaine Greer deliver a lecture on women in literature. Roger Stone was a primary catalyst of the rumor\u2019s spread. But while he maintained in 2014 that Clinton was expelled from Oxford over a sexual assault incident, he said in 2015 that little to no action was taken. His later reference didn\u2019t involve Clinton\u2019s expulsion and hinged on what Stone \u201cbelieved\u201d may have taken place: Ironically, Bill Clinton\u2019s first alleged rape was of a 19-year-old coed named Eileen Wellstone. We believe that he was not prosecuted because the State Department did not want a Rhodes Scholar charged with rape. Stone also made two mentions of Wellstone in his 2015\u00a0book The Clintons\u2019 War on Women, co-authored by Robert Morrow, who was the subject of a 2008 Tampa Bay Times profile which didn\u2019t imply an overabundance of credibility or tendency toward critical examination of Clinton conspiracies: Robert Morrow is on a roll, talking loud enough to draw wary glances from two women lunching nearby at Macaroni Grill. \u201cChelsea is the seed of Web Hubbell and not Bill Clinton.

With no job except occasional day trading of stocks, Morrow spends anywhere from one to 10 hours a day researching Clinton dirt or e-mailing and phoning reporters across the country about his conclusions. \u201cI\u2019ve got other aspects of my life when I\u2019m not, you know, stopping Clinton pond scum,\u201d insists Morrow, who has no steady job but enjoys a family inheritance. Lack of proof means nothing to Morrow. Morrow started his anti-Clinton crusade about three years ago, when he decided he needed to devote himself to making sure Hillary Clinton never wins the White House. He can\u2019t pinpoint what set him on this path beyond his conviction that the Clintons are ruthless \u201csociopaths that need to be crushed and defeated.\u201d Stone and Morrow\u2019s book contained two\u00a0passages about Wellstone which appeared be be based on second- or third-hand information. Moreover, those passages contained contradictory information: in one, the authors said Clinton\u2019s expulsion or coerced departure from Oxford \u201ccould not be confirmed\u201d; in another, the authors plainly asserted without qualification that Clinton had been expelled. And all of the cited information traced back to the single questionable 1999 Capitol Hill Blue report: The original Capitol Hill Blue piece included several instances that all followed the same pattern: A young woman whom no one had ever heard of (in most cases the women weren\u2019t even identified by name) had supposedly accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault decades earlier but had declined to pursue any charges against him at the time. Capitol Hill Blue somehow managed to track all these women down, and all of them allegedly \u201cconfirmed\u201d their experiences \u2014 yet none of them was directly quoted, and all of them declined to go on record or discuss the matter any further. Moreover all of these incidents were coincidentally also \u201cconfirmed\u201d by other people (e.g., government officials, retired policemen, former students), none of whom was identified by name or directly quoted either. Even more curiously, as far as we know no one else has ever located, talked to, or interviewed Eileen Wellstone or any of the other women referenced in  Capitol Hill Blue who were supposedly the victim of sexual assaults by Bill Clinton between 1969 and 1974.

{"claim_id":"34375","hypothesis":"A 31-year-old British woman died of \u2018cannabis poisoning\u2019 in October 2013.","explanation_1":"The fact of the matter is that unexplained, sudden deaths occasionally strike down healthy individuals. The absence of a clear explanation for a death should not compel acceptance of a scientifically implausible one, however. In our view, death from direct cannabis toxicity is unlikely, as this event is generally viewed to be medically impossible. The incidence of a heart attack as a contributing factor in the case of death that is not otherwise fully explainable is certainly a possibility, but the notion that smoking half a joint would trigger a fatal heart attack in a person who did not exhibit any existing cardiovascular disease strains credulity. Accordingly, we rank this claim as unproven.","premise":"On 30 January 2014, the British tabloid Daily Mail published an article with the following liberally capitalized and attention-grabbing headline: Devout Christian Mother-of-Three, 31, Becomes First Woman in Britain to DIE from Cannabis Poisoning After Smoking a Joint in Bed to Help Her Sleep. Based on the testimony of the pathologist who performed an autopsy on a 31-year-old woman named Gemma Moss, who was found dead next to a half-smoked marijuana joint, the Mail concluded that she \u201cdied directly from cannabis poisoning\u201d: A young mother of three died after she was poisoned by the cannabis she smoked to help her get to sleep. Gemma Moss, 31, was killed by the level of the drug in her blood, an inquest heard. The regular churchgoer, who was found dead in her bedroom, is thought to be the first woman in Britain known to have died directly from cannabis poisoning. Her death was caused by cannabis toxicity, and a coroner recorded a verdict of death by cannabis abuse.The inquest was told that Miss Moss smoked half a joint a night to help her sleep. Reports from the local newspaper of the town in which Moss lived confirm both her death, which occurred on 28 October 2013, as well as the suggested link between her demise and a half-smoked joint. An inquest (i.e., a legal investigation into her death) was held on 21 January 2014. During this proceeding, a pathologist provided his opinion that cannabis \u201ccaused [Moss\u2019s] death.\u201d The testimony that inspired that pathologist\u2019s interpretation, however, was a bit more vague than the Daily Mail\u2019s specific claim of cannabis \u201cpoisoning\u201d, based on a longer account of the proceedings published by the UK\u2019s more respectable Telegraph newspaper: A post mortem examination revealed that there were no obvious signs of abnormality in Miss Moss\u2019 body. But Dr Kudair Hussein, a pathologist, told the inquest in Bournemouth, that there were moderate to heavy levels of [chemicals associated with cannabis] in her blood. He said: \u201cThe physical examination and the examination of various organs including the heart and the liver showed no abnormality that could account for her death. The level of cannabinoids in the blood were 0.1 to 0.15 milligrams per litre, this is considered as moderate to heavy cannabis use. I looked through literature and it\u2019s well known that cannabis is of very low toxicity. But there are reports which say cannabis can be considered as a cause of death because it can induce a cardiac arrest.\u201d Mr Sheriff Payne, the Bournemouth coroner, asked Dr Hussein: \u201cYou are satisfied it was the effects of cannabis that caused her death.\u201d Dr Hussain replied: \u201cYes sir.\u201d The phrase \u201cthe effects of cannabis\u201d leaves room for presuming an indirect relationship between Moss\u2019s death and cannabis (i.e., one that would not be considered a \u201cpoisoning\u201d). In captions attached to some of the photographs, and in a sidebar, the Daily Mail seems to suggest a heart attack triggered by cannabis \u2014 an entirely different claim than the one expressed in their headline \u2014 might have been the cause of Moss\u2019s death: Tests of Moss\u2019s vital organs revealed nothing wrong with them, although testimony offered at the inquest was suggested she might have suffered a cardiac arrest triggered by cannabis toxicity. Perhaps unintentionally, then, the article presents two conflicting hypotheses that require investigation: 1) Is it possible to consume enough cannabis that you are directly poisoned by its toxicity? ; and 2) Is it possible for marijuana to trigger a (fatal) heart attack? Is it Possible to Consume Enough Cannabis to Be Directly Poisoned by Its Toxicity? There is a near universal agreement on the answer to this question: No. While no studies designed to ascertain a lethal dose level for THC \u2014 the primary psychoactive component of cannabis \u2014 have been undertaken on humans, a number of animal studies suggest that THC\u2019s potential toxicity is remarkably low. Such studies seek to address what concentration of a chemical causes a lethal reaction in 50% of population of test subjects, known as the LD50. A study performed in the 1970s (whose results are described here) attempted to determine this value in a variety of rodent, dog, and monkey populations: The acute toxicity of THC is low. Acute lethal human toxicity for cannabis has not been substantiated. The median lethal dose (LD50) of oral THC in rats was 800\u20131900 mg\/kg depending on sex and strain. There were no cases of death due to toxicity following the maximum THC dose in dogs (up to 3000 mg\/kg THC) and monkeys (up to 9000 mg\/kg THC). In other words, scientists were literally unable to intentionally cause fatal toxicity from cannabis in both dogs and primates. This lack of lethality was famously put into perspective by an oft-cited 1972 report issued by President Nixon\u2019s \u201cNational Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse\u201d (The Shafer Commission), a group whose findings the Nixon administration ultimately ignored: In summary, enormous doses of Delta 9 THC, All THC and concentrated marihuana extract ingested by mouth were unable to produce death or organ pathology in large mammals but did produce fatalities in smaller rodents due to profound central nervous system depression. The non-fatal consumption of 3000 mg\/kg A THC by the dog and monkey would be comparable to a 154-pound human eating approximately 46 pounds (21 kilograms) of 1%-marihuana or 10 pounds of 5% hashish at one time. In addition, 92 mg\/kg THC intravenously produced no fatalities in monkeys. These doses would be comparable to a 154-pound human smoking at one time almost three pounds (1.28 kg) of 1%-marihuana or 250,000 times the usual smoked dose and over a million times the minimal effective dose assuming 50% destruction of the THC by smoking While higher potency of marijuana would change that math a bit, it would not change it enough for that amount of combustion and inhalation to be possible. A 2011 report on drug abuse from the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) states that there had been (at least at that time), zero documented cases of fatal overdoses from cannabis. If cannabis killed Gemma Moss, it would had to have done so through a mechanism other than direct toxicity. Is it Possible for Marijuana to Trigger a Heart Attack? That cannabis affects the cardiovascular system is uncontroversial. A 2001 study published in the journal Circulation reviewed the most significant interactions between cannabis and the heart: Several effects of smoked marijuana on the cardiovascular system have been well described. For example, smoking marijuana is associated with a dose-dependent increase in heart rate. In addition, most subjects experience an increase in blood pressure, particularly when supine. In addition to the hemodynamic effects, smoked marijuana is associated with an increase in carboxyhemoglobin, resulting in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity. Thus, taken together, smoking marijuana is associated with an increase in myocardial oxygen demand and a concomitant decrease in oxygen supply. To see if these effects contributed to the incidence of heart attacks, researchers surveyed 3882 patients who had suffered heart attacks, asking them to recall when they had most recently smoked marijuana (if at all) prior to their heart attacks. The investigation concluded that: Smoking marijuana is a rare trigger of acute myocardial infarction and may pose a health risk to patients with established coronary artery disease and perhaps to individuals with multiple coronary risk factors. As well, a variety of case reports at least hint at the fact that marijuana could increase the risk of heart attacks in users who already exhibit other risk factors. The question is, however, whether marijuana could cause a heart attack on its own (i.e., in the absence of these risk factors or other contributory causes). To date, the answer to this question remains controversial, but most research suggests that other risk factors need to be present for cannabis use to be a trigger for a heart attack. While we allow it is technically possible that cannabis could have contributed to Gemma Moss\u2019s death, as suggested by a pathologist and some news accounts, it is important to note that \u2014 based on the Daily Mail\u2019s own reporting \u2014 Moss exhibited no signs of a heart attack or any other form of organ failure. Other Explanations The only evidence presented linking Moss\u2019s death to cannabis was the fact that she was found dead next to a half-smoked joint, and that her bloodstream showed that she had consumed marijuana. Nearly any other suggested cause for her sudden death would be, from an evidentiary standpoint, as valid as the pathologist\u2019s claim that it was likely from marijuana. Yes, the most plausible way for cannabis to have contributed to Moss\u2019s death would have been through some sort of cardiovascular event, but research suggests that such an event would be extremely rare (if not impossible) in the absence of other risk factors. Numerous other non-marijuana-related causes of cardiac arrest also appear to have been excluded without investigation.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4075,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"On 30 January 2014, the British tabloid Daily Mail published an article with the following liberally capitalized and attention-grabbing headline: Devout Christian Mother-of-Three, 31, Becomes First Woman in Britain to DIE from Cannabis Poisoning After Smoking a Joint in Bed to Help Her Sleep. Based on the testimony of the pathologist who performed an autopsy on a 31-year-old woman named Gemma Moss, who was found dead next to a half-smoked marijuana joint, the Mail concluded that she \u201cdied directly from cannabis poisoning\u201d: A young mother of three died after she was poisoned by the cannabis she smoked to help her get to sleep. Gemma Moss, 31, was killed by the level of the drug in her blood, an inquest heard. The regular churchgoer, who was found dead in her bedroom, is thought to be the first woman in Britain known to have died directly from cannabis poisoning. Her death was caused by cannabis toxicity, and a coroner recorded a verdict of death by cannabis abuse.The inquest was told that Miss Moss smoked half a joint a night to help her sleep. Reports from the local newspaper of the town in which Moss lived confirm both her death, which occurred on 28 October 2013, as well as the suggested link between her demise and a half-smoked joint. An inquest (i.e., a legal investigation into her death) was held on 21 January 2014. During this proceeding, a pathologist provided his opinion that cannabis \u201ccaused [Moss\u2019s] death.\u201d The testimony that inspired that pathologist\u2019s interpretation, however, was a bit more vague than the Daily Mail\u2019s specific claim of cannabis \u201cpoisoning\u201d, based on a longer account of the proceedings published by the UK\u2019s more respectable Telegraph newspaper: A post mortem examination revealed that there were no obvious signs of abnormality in Miss Moss\u2019 body. But Dr Kudair Hussein, a pathologist, told the inquest in Bournemouth, that there were moderate to heavy levels of [chemicals associated with cannabis] in her blood. He said: \u201cThe physical examination and the examination of various organs including the heart and the liver showed no abnormality that could account for her death. The level of cannabinoids in the blood were 0.1 to 0.15 milligrams per litre, this is considered as moderate to heavy cannabis use. I looked through literature and it\u2019s well known that cannabis is of very low toxicity. But there are reports which say cannabis can be considered as a cause of death because it can induce a cardiac arrest.\u201d Mr Sheriff Payne, the Bournemouth coroner, asked Dr Hussein: \u201cYou are satisfied it was the effects of cannabis that caused her death.\u201d Dr Hussain replied: \u201cYes sir.\u201d The phrase \u201cthe effects of cannabis\u201d leaves room for presuming an indirect relationship between Moss\u2019s death and cannabis (i.e., one that would not be considered a \u201cpoisoning\u201d). In captions attached to some of the photographs, and in a sidebar, the Daily Mail seems to suggest a heart attack triggered by cannabis \u2014 an entirely different claim than the one expressed in their headline \u2014 might have been the cause of Moss\u2019s death: Tests of Moss\u2019s vital organs revealed nothing wrong with them, although testimony offered at the inquest was suggested she might have suffered a cardiac arrest triggered by cannabis toxicity. Perhaps unintentionally, then, the article presents two conflicting hypotheses that require investigation: 1) Is it possible to consume enough cannabis that you are directly poisoned by its toxicity? ; and 2) Is it possible for marijuana to trigger a (fatal) heart attack? Is it Possible to Consume Enough Cannabis to Be Directly Poisoned by Its Toxicity? There is a near universal agreement on the answer to this question: No. While no studies designed to ascertain a lethal dose level for THC \u2014 the primary psychoactive component of cannabis \u2014 have been undertaken on humans, a number of animal studies suggest that THC\u2019s potential toxicity is remarkably low.

Studies on cannabis indicate its toxicity levels are extremely low, with no recorded cases of fatal overdose in humans due to direct toxicity. Additionally, the pathologist mentioned the possibility of cannabis inducing a cardiac event, but this is considered rare and typically associated with other risk factors, which were not mentioned in Moss's case.\n\nGiven the conflicting information and the lack of a direct link between cannabis toxicity and death, there is not enough evidence to definitively confirm the claim that Moss died from \"cannabis poisoning.\""}

One, for instance, reported that her daughter, who \u201cbasically only wears\u201d Jellies, also demonstrated elevated lead levels:   None of the\u00a0postings holding that Walmart\u2019s jellies contained lead came from or cited an official source, such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Protection Agency, or Walmart, nor did they rely upon confirmed laboratory testing. Rather, one posting was based on a home test kit and the other on speculation. While some social media users asserted that they tested jellies and found that they contained unsafe levels of lead, others performed the same testing and found that the products were apparently safe:  Tamara Rubin,\u00a0a lead-poisoning prevention advocate, also tested the jelly shoes and found that they were lead free. It should also be noted that this rumor is based on\u00a0the testing of individual\u00a0products, and not all jelly sandals. Walmart has not issued a recall on any of their jelly shoe products: We haven\u2019t come across any recalls for jelly shoes. However, please be assured that whenever recalls are issued, we take immediate steps to comply with them. If you ever have questions about a product, you can visit http:\/\/corporate.walmart.com\/recalls\u00a0to check the recent recall list issued by government regulatory agencies responsible for product recalls.

Walmart also stated that the shoes underwent additional testing which confirmed they do not contain unsafe levels of lead.

Despite their claims to the contrary, a goodly number of folks do not wash their hands after performing bathroom functions.

An August 2003 survey of handwashing habits in airport restrooms further bore out that observation: reported the American Society of Microbiology, more than 30% of people using restrooms in New York airports, 19% of those in Miami\u2019s airport, and 27% of air travelers in Chicago didn\u2019t wash their hands. However, it is not the interaction of unwashed hands and hand dryers that is the concern (because, after all, no one is trying to dry unwashed hands, since they\u2019re not wet to begin with), but rather of poorly-washed hands. Precious few nasty microbes are dislodged by tap water alone: merely rinsing one\u2019s hands under running water and then drying them with a blower is doing little other than putting microbe-laden (albeit wet) hands in front of a wind generating machine. Also, of those that use soap in the ablutions, not all that many wash their hands long enough to rid themselves of whatever nasties their hands have accumulated. For handwashing to be effective, folks need to lather up and then scrub for no less than 20 seconds before rinsing (roughly the same amount of time it takes to twice run through \u201cHappy Birthday to You\u201d). Those who don\u2019t wash all that well or for long enough are putting still-germy hands under a blower. Whether germs, microbes, or viruses could be blown off still-wet hands and into the surrounding air by such devices is an unanswered question, though. Paper towels offer a couple of advantages that electric hand dryers do not. Since their use is frictional (you rub your hands with them), the act of drying with them can aid in the removal of some bacteria. Also, given that the four most microbe-laden areas of public restrooms are the toilet, the floor around it, the counter area, and door and flush handles, using a paper towel on the door handle when exiting the restroom rather than handling it directly can keep one from coming into contact with one of microbial \u201chot spots\u201d of such venues. However, paper towels also have their microbial downside as used ones are discarded in bins, which means whatever got wiped onto them is now lurking in a communal garbage can, happily multiplying away in that warm, damp environment. One downside inherent to hand dryers is that folks tend not to use them correctly. Whether it\u2019s the noise, or a sense of the user\u2019s being made the center of attention, or just the amount of time such air blasting takes, people tend not to keep their hands under the blower until drying is complete, instead preferring to walk away with damp hands.

Don\u2019t Let Freedom Slip AwayBy: Kitty Werthmann What I am about to tell you is something you\u2019ve probably never heard or will ever read in history books. I believe that I am an eyewitness to history. I cannot tell you that Hitler took Austria by tanks and guns; it would distort history. We elected him by a landslide \u2013 98% of the vote.. I\u2019ve never read that in any American publications. Everyone thinks that Hitler just rolled in with his tanks and took Austria by force. In 1938, Austria was in deep Depression. Nearly one-third of our workforce was unemployed. We had 25% inflation and 25% bank loan interest rates. Farmers and business people were declaring bankruptcy daily. Young people were going from house to house begging for food.. Not that they didn\u2019t want to work; there simply weren\u2019t any jobs. My mother was a Christian woman and believed in helping people in need.. Every day we cooked a big kettle of soup and baked bread to feed those poor, hungry people \u2013 about 30 daily. The Communist Party and the National Socialist Party were fighting each other. Blocks and blocks of cities like Vienna, Linz, and Graz were destroyed. The people became desperate and petitioned the government to let them decide what kind of government they wanted. We looked to our neighbor on the north, Germany, where Hitler had been in power since 1933. We had been told that they didn\u2019t have unemployment or crime, and they had a high standard of living. Nothing was ever said about persecution of any group \u2014 Jewish or otherwise. We were led to believe that everyone was happy. We wanted the same way of life in Austria . We were promised that a vote for Hitler would mean the end of unemployment and help for the family. Hitler also said that businesses would be assisted, and farmers would get their farms back. Ninety-eight percent of the population voted to annex Austria to Germany and have Hitler for our ruler. We were overjoyed, and for three days we danced in the streets and had candlelight parades. The new government opened up big field kitchens and everyone was fed. After the election, German officials were appointed, and like a miracle, we suddenly had law and order. Three or four weeks later, everyone was employed. The government made sure that a lot of work was created through the Public Work Service. Hitler decided we should have equal rights for women. Before this, it was a custom that married Austrian women did not work outside the home. An able-bodied husband would be looked down on if he couldn\u2019t support his family. Many women in the teaching profession were elated that they could retain the jobs they previously had been required to give up for marriage. Hitler Targets Education \u2013 Eliminates Religious Instruction for Children: Our education was nationalized. I attended a very good public school. The population was predominantly Catholic, so we had religion in our schools. The day we elected Hitler (March 13, 1938), I walked into my schoolroom to find the crucifix replaced by Hitler\u2019s picture hanging next to a Nazi flag. Our teacher, a very devout woman, stood up and told the class we wouldn\u2019t pray or have religion anymore. Instead, we sang \u201cDeutschland, Deutschland, Uber Alles,\u201d and had physical education. Sunday became National Youth Day with compulsory attendance. Parents were not pleased about the sudden change in curriculum. They were told that if they did not send us, they would receive a stiff letter of warning the first time. The second time they would be fined the equivalent of $300, and the third time they would be subject to jail. The first two hours consisted of political indoctrination. The rest of the day we had sports. As time went along, we loved it.. Oh, we had so much fun and got our sports equipment free. We would go home and gleefully tell our parents about the wonderful time we had. My mother was very unhappy. When the next term started, she took me out of public school and put me in a convent. I told her she couldn\u2019t do that and she told me that someday when I grew up, I would be grateful. There was a very good curriculum, but hardly any fun \u2013 no sports, and no political indoctrination. I hated it at first but felt I could tolerate it. Every once in a while, on holidays, I went home. I would go back to my old friends and ask what was going on and what they were doing. Their loose lifestyle was very alarming to me. They lived without religion. By that time unwed mothers were glorified for having a baby for Hitler. It seemed strange to me that our society changed so suddenly. As time went along, I realized what a great deed my mother did so that I wasn\u2019t exposed to that kind of humanistic philosophy. Equal Rights Hits Home: In 1939, the war started and a food bank was established. All food was rationed and could only be purchased using food stamps. At the same time, a full-employment law was passed which meant if you didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get a ration card, and if you didn\u2019t have a card, you starved to death. Women who stayed home to raise their families didn\u2019t have any marketable skills and often had to take jobs more suited for men. Soon after this, the draft was implemented. It was compulsory for young people, male and female, to give one year to the labor corps. During the day, the girls worked on the farms, and at night they returned to their barracks for military training just like the boys. They were trained to be anti-aircraft gunners and participated in the signal corps. After the labor corps, they were not discharged but were used in the front lines. When I go back to Austria to visit my family and friends, most of these women are emotional cripples because they just were not equipped to handle the horrors of combat. Three months before I turned 18, I was severely injured in an air raid attack. I nearly had a leg amputated, so I was spared having to go into the labor corps and into military service. Hitler Restructured the Family Through Daycare: When the mothers had to go out into the work force, the government immediately established child care centers. You could take your children ages 4 weeks to school age and leave them there around-the-clock, 7 days a week, under the total care of the government. The state raised a whole generation of children.. There were no motherly women to take care of the children, just people highly trained in child psychology. By this time, no one talked about equal rights. We knew we had been had. Health Care and Small Business Suffer Under Government Controls: Before Hitler, we had very good medical care. Many American doctors trained at the University of Vienna . After Hitler, health care was socialized, free for everyone. Doctors were salaried by the government. The problem was, since it was free, the people were going to the doctors for everything. When the good doctor arrived at his office at 8 a.m., 40 people were already waiting and, at the same time, the hospitals were full. If you needed elective surgery, you had to wait a year or two for your turn. There was no money for research as it was poured into socialized medicine. Research at the medical schools literally stopped, so the best doctors left Austria and emigrated to other countries. As for healthcare, our tax rates went up to 80% of our income. Newlyweds immediately received a $1,000 loan from the government to establish a household. We had big programs for families. All day care and education were free. High schools were taken over by the government and college tuition was subsidized. Everyone was entitled to free handouts, such as food stamps, clothing, and housing. We had another agency designed to monitor business. My brother-in-law owned a restaurant that had square tables. Government officials told him he had to replace them with round tables because people might bump themselves on the corners. Then they said he had to have additional bathroom facilities. It was just a small dairy business with a snack bar. He couldn\u2019t meet all the demands. Soon, he went out of business. If the government owned the large businesses and not many small ones existed, it could be in control. We had consumer protection. We were told how to shop and what to buy. Free enterprise was essentially abolished. We had a planning agency specially designed for farmers. The agents would go to the farms, count the live-stock, then tell the farmers what to produce, and how to produce it. \u201cMercy Killing\u201d Redefined: In 1944, I was a student teacher in a small village in the Alps . The villagers were surrounded by mountain passes which, in the winter, were closed off with snow, causing people to be isolated. So people intermarried and offspring were sometimes retarded. When I arrived, I was told there were 15 mentally retarded adults, but they were all useful and did good manual work. I knew one, named Vincent, very well. He was a janitor of the school. One day I looked out the window and saw Vincent and others getting into a van. I asked my superior where they were going. She said to an institution where the State Health Department would teach them a trade, and to read and write. The families were required to sign papers with a little clause that they could not visit for 6 months. They were told visits would interfere with the program and might cause homesickness. As time passed, letters started to dribble back saying these people died a natural, merciful death. The villagers were not fooled. We suspected what was happening. Those people left in excellent physical health and all died within 6 months. We called this euthanasia. The Final Steps \u2013 Gun Laws: Next came gun registration. People were getting injured by guns. Hitler said that the real way to catch criminals (we still had a few) was by matching serial numbers on guns. Most citizens were law abiding and dutifully marched to the police station to register their firearms. Not long afterwards, the police said that it was best for everyone to turn in their guns. The authorities already knew who had them, so it was futile not to comply voluntarily. No more freedom of speech. Anyone who said something against the government was taken away. We knew many people who were arrested, not only Jews, but also priests and ministers who spoke up. Totalitarianism didn\u2019t come quickly, it took 5 years from 1938 until 1943, to realize full dictatorship in Austria .Had it happened overnight, my countrymen would have fought to the last breath. Instead, we had creeping gradualism. Now, our only weapons were broom handles. The whole idea sounds almost unbelievable that the state, little by little eroded our freedom. After World War II, Russian troops occupied Austria. Women were raped, preteen to elderly. The press never wrote about this either. When the Soviets left in 1955, they took everything that they could, dismantling whole factories in the process. They sawed down whole orchards of fruit, and what they couldn\u2019t destroy, they burned. We called it The Burned Earth. Most of the population barricaded themselves in their houses. Women hid in their cellars for 6 weeks as the troops mobilized. Those who couldn\u2019t, paid the price. There is a monument in Vienna today, dedicated to those women who were massacred by the Russians. This is an eye witness account. \u201cIt\u2019s true..those of us who sailed past the Statue of Liberty came to a country of unbelievable freedom and opportunity.

I\u2019ve never read that in any American publications. Everyone thinks that Hitler just rolled in with his tanks and took Austria by force. In 1938, Austria was in deep Depression. Nearly one-third of our workforce was unemployed. We had 25% inflation and 25% bank loan interest rates. Farmers and business people were declaring bankruptcy daily. Young people were going from house to house begging for food.. Not that they didn\u2019t want to work; there simply weren\u2019t any jobs. My mother was a Christian woman and believed in helping people in need.. Every day we cooked a big kettle of soup and baked bread to feed those poor, hungry people \u2013 about 30 daily. The Communist Party and the National Socialist Party were fighting each other. Blocks and blocks of cities like Vienna, Linz, and Graz were destroyed. The people became desperate and petitioned the government to let them decide what kind of government they wanted. We looked to our neighbor on the north, Germany, where Hitler had been in power since 1933. We had been told that they didn\u2019t have unemployment or crime, and they had a high standard of living. Nothing was ever said about persecution of any group \u2014 Jewish or otherwise. We were led to believe that everyone was happy. We wanted the same way of life in Austria . We were promised that a vote for Hitler would mean the end of unemployment and help for the family. Hitler also said that businesses would be assisted, and farmers would get their farms back. Ninety-eight percent of the population voted to annex Austria to Germany and have Hitler for our ruler. We were overjoyed, and for three days we danced in the streets and had candlelight parades. The new government opened up big field kitchens and everyone was fed. After the election, German officials were appointed, and like a miracle, we suddenly had law and order. Three or four weeks later, everyone was employed. The government made sure that a lot of work was created through the Public Work Service. Hitler decided we should have equal rights for women. Before this, it was a custom that married Austrian women did not work outside the home. An able-bodied husband would be looked down on if he couldn\u2019t support his family. Many women in the teaching profession were elated that they could retain the jobs they previously had been required to give up for marriage. Hitler Targets Education \u2013 Eliminates Religious Instruction for Children: Our education was nationalized. I attended a very good public school. The population was predominantly Catholic, so we had religion in our schools. The day we elected Hitler (March 13, 1938), I walked into my schoolroom to find the crucifix replaced by Hitler\u2019s picture hanging next to a Nazi flag. Our teacher, a very devout woman, stood up and told the class we wouldn\u2019t pray or have religion anymore. Instead, we sang \u201cDeutschland, Deutschland, Uber Alles,\u201d and had physical education. Sunday became National Youth Day with compulsory attendance. Parents were not pleased about the sudden change in curriculum. They were told that if they did not send us, they would receive a stiff letter of warning the first time. The second time they would be fined the equivalent of $300, and the third time they would be subject to jail. The first two hours consisted of political indoctrination. The rest of the day we had sports. As time went along, we loved it.. Oh, we had so much fun and got our sports equipment free. We would go home and gleefully tell our parents about the wonderful time we had. My mother was very unhappy. When the next term started, she took me out of public school and put me in a convent. I told her she couldn\u2019t do that and she told me that someday when I grew up, I would be grateful. There was a very good curriculum, but hardly any fun \u2013 no sports, and no political indoctrination. I hated it at first but felt I could tolerate it. Every once in a while, on holidays, I went home. I would go back to my old friends and ask what was going on and what they were doing. Their loose lifestyle was very alarming to me. They lived without religion. By that time unwed mothers were glorified for having a baby for Hitler. It seemed strange to me that our society changed so suddenly. As time went along, I realized what a great deed my mother did so that I wasn\u2019t exposed to that kind of humanistic philosophy. Equal Rights Hits Home: In 1939, the war started and a food bank was established. All food was rationed and could only be purchased using food stamps. At the same time, a full-employment law was passed which meant if you didn\u2019t work, you didn\u2019t get a ration card, and if you didn\u2019t have a card, you starved to death. Women who stayed home to raise their families didn\u2019t have any marketable skills and often had to take jobs more suited for men. Soon after this, the draft was implemented. It was compulsory for young people, male and female, to give one year to the labor corps. During the day, the girls worked on the farms, and at night they returned to their barracks for military training just like the boys. They were trained to be anti-aircraft gunners and participated in the signal corps. After the labor corps, they were not discharged but were used in the front lines. When I go back to Austria to visit my family and friends, most of these women are emotional cripples because they just were not equipped to handle the horrors of combat. Three months before I turned 18, I was severely injured in an air raid attack. I nearly had a leg amputated, so I was spared having to go into the labor corps and into military service. Hitler Restructured the Family Through Daycare: When the mothers had to go out into the work force, the government immediately established child care centers. You could take your children ages 4 weeks to school age and leave them there around-the-clock, 7 days a week, under the total care of the government. The state raised a whole generation of children.. There were no motherly women to take care of the children, just people highly trained in child psychology. By this time, no one talked about equal rights. We knew we had been had. Health Care and Small Business Suffer Under Government Controls: Before Hitler, we had very good medical care. Many American doctors trained at the University of Vienna . After Hitler, health care was socialized, free for everyone. Doctors were salaried by the government. The problem was, since it was free, the people were going to the doctors for everything. When the good doctor arrived at his office at 8 a.m., 40 people were already waiting and, at the same time, the hospitals were full. If you needed elective surgery, you had to wait a year or two for your turn. There was no money for research as it was poured into socialized medicine. Research at the medical schools literally stopped, so the best doctors left Austria and emigrated to other countries. As for healthcare, our tax rates went up to 80% of our income. Newlyweds immediately received a $1,000 loan from the government to establish a household. We had big programs for families. All day care and education were free. High schools were taken over by the government and college tuition was subsidized. Everyone was entitled to free handouts, such as food stamps, clothing, and housing. We had another agency designed to monitor business. My brother-in-law owned a restaurant that had square tables. Government officials told him he had to replace them with round tables because people might bump themselves on the corners. Then they said he had to have additional bathroom facilities. It was just a small dairy business with a snack bar. He couldn\u2019t meet all the demands. Soon, he went out of business. If the government owned the large businesses and not many small ones existed, it could be in control. We had consumer protection. We were told how to shop and what to buy. Free enterprise was essentially abolished. We had a planning agency specially designed for farmers. The agents would go to the farms, count the live-stock, then tell the farmers what to produce, and how to produce it. \u201cMercy Killing\u201d Redefined: In 1944, I was a student teacher in a small village in the Alps . The villagers were surrounded by mountain passes which, in the winter, were closed off with snow, causing people to be isolated. So people intermarried and offspring were sometimes retarded. When I arrived, I was told there were 15 mentally retarded adults, but they were all useful and did good manual work. I knew one, named Vincent, very well. He was a janitor of the school. One day I looked out the window and saw Vincent and others getting into a van. I asked my superior where they were going. She said to an institution where the State Health Department would teach them a trade, and to read and write. The families were required to sign papers with a little clause that they could not visit for 6 months. They were told visits would interfere with the program and might cause homesickness. As time passed, letters started to dribble back saying these people died a natural, merciful death. The villagers were not fooled. We suspected what was happening. Those people left in excellent physical health and all died within 6 months. We called this euthanasia. The Final Steps \u2013 Gun Laws: Next came gun registration. People were getting injured by guns. Hitler said that the real way to catch criminals (we still had a few) was by matching serial numbers on guns. Most citizens were law abiding and dutifully marched to the police station to register their firearms. Not long afterwards, the police said that it was best for everyone to turn in their guns. The authorities already knew who had them, so it was futile not to comply voluntarily. No more freedom of speech. Anyone who said something against the government was taken away. We knew many people who were arrested, not only Jews, but also priests and ministers who spoke up. Totalitarianism didn\u2019t come quickly, it took 5 years from 1938 until 1943, to realize full dictatorship in Austria .Had it happened overnight, my countrymen would have fought to the last breath. Instead, we had creeping gradualism. Now, our only weapons were broom handles. The whole idea sounds almost unbelievable that the state, little by little eroded our freedom. After World War II, Russian troops occupied Austria. Women were raped, preteen to elderly. The press never wrote about this either. When the Soviets left in 1955, they took everything that they could, dismantling whole factories in the process. They sawed down whole orchards of fruit, and what they couldn\u2019t destroy, they burned. We called it The Burned Earth. Most of the population barricaded themselves in their houses. Women hid in their cellars for 6 weeks as the troops mobilized. Those who couldn\u2019t, paid the price. There is a monument in Vienna today, dedicated to those women who were massacred by the Russians. This is an eye witness account. \u201cIt\u2019s true..those of us who sailed past the Statue of Liberty came to a country of unbelievable freedom and opportunity.

{"claim_id":"40146","hypothesis":" Warnings on Facebook have gone viral alleging that using Huggies Snug and Dry diapers on babies could result in second degree chemical burns. ","explanation_1":"Second Degree Chemical Burns from Huggies Diapers ","premise":"TruthOrFiction.Com was contacted a spokesperson at Kimberly-Clark who gave us an official statement saying that \u201cthere is no indication that this complaint is part of any larger product issues.\u201d\u00a0 The statement also said that such customer complaints are rare but when Kimberly-Clark hears about them they follow up to ensure the safety of their products. Here is their statement : At HUGGIES, nothing is more important than the safety of the little ones who use our products. Families have put their trust in HUGGIES diapers for decades and all of our diapers have been thoroughly tested to ensure they are safe. Our primary interest remains with the wellbeing of the child involved. When we first learned about this report, we immediately reached out to the mom to express our concern and learn as much as we could about what happened. In addition to requesting samples of the diapers used by the mom for testing, we also initiated an internal review. While we have not yet received any samples from this consumer, our internal review has not found any product issues or abnormalities. We understand how deeply moms care about the health of their baby\u2019s skin and we are always troubled by any report of skin irritation. In each and every case, we try to work closely with the moms to learn about their individual situation to ensure that our products can better meet their needs and help inform our ongoing product development. All of our products must pass stringent safety reviews prior to making it to retailer shelf. This review includes the superabsorbent material in question which has been thoroughly evaluated by more than 450 medical and scientific studies and has been used safely for years in our HUGGIES products and across the diaper industry. There is no indication that this complaint is part of any larger product issues. Complaints of this nature are highly unusual \u2013 in fact over the past six months the rate is about one for every 40 million diapers sold. We take our responsibility to provide families with products they can use with confidence very seriously, and will continue to do everything we can to understand what occurred and how we can help. Additional Background The Superabsorbent materials (SAM) found in HUGGIES diapers is being used in virtually all disposable diapers on the market today. Superabsorbent materials (SAM), also known as polyacrylate absorbents, are a family of polymers that have extraordinary absorbency \u2014 the particles will absorb up to 100 times their weight in moisture. The safety of superabsorbent material has been proven in more than 450 consumer safety tests that have studied every way a person could come in contact with it \u2014 through skin contact, ingestion or even inhalation. Each study has consistently demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this material. The crystals in the diaper are forms of a superabsorbent material that\u2019s been used in diapers for many years. The superabsorbent material looks like a tiny bead when it\u2019s dry and looks like a gel when it\u2019s wet (and mixed with the other fluffy fibers in the diaper). Superabsorbent material in diapers offers significant benefits, like drawing wetness away from baby\u2019s skin and helping to keep baby\u2019s skin healthy. In HUGGIES diapers, superabsorbent material is mixed with the fluffy diaper padding. This material turns liquid into a gel, helping to prevent leakage. Occasionally, you may see small beads of gel on the diaper or on your baby, but the gel is nontoxic and not harmful.

In addition to requesting samples of the diapers used by the mom for testing, we also initiated an internal review. While we have not yet received any samples from this consumer, our internal review has not found any product issues or abnormalities. We understand how deeply moms care about the health of their baby\u2019s skin and we are always troubled by any report of skin irritation. In each and every case, we try to work closely with the moms to learn about their individual situation to ensure that our products can better meet their needs and help inform our ongoing product development. All of our products must pass stringent safety reviews prior to making it to retailer shelf. This review includes the superabsorbent material in question which has been thoroughly evaluated by more than 450 medical and scientific studies and has been used safely for years in our HUGGIES products and across the diaper industry. There is no indication that this complaint is part of any larger product issues. Complaints of this nature are highly unusual \u2013 in fact over the past six months the rate is about one for every 40 million diapers sold. We take our responsibility to provide families with products they can use with confidence very seriously, and will continue to do everything we can to understand what occurred and how we can help. Additional Background The Superabsorbent materials (SAM) found in HUGGIES diapers is being used in virtually all disposable diapers on the market today. Superabsorbent materials (SAM), also known as polyacrylate absorbents, are a family of polymers that have extraordinary absorbency \u2014 the particles will absorb up to 100 times their weight in moisture. The safety of superabsorbent material has been proven in more than 450 consumer safety tests that have studied every way a person could come in contact with it \u2014 through skin contact, ingestion or even inhalation. Each study has consistently demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this material. The crystals in the diaper are forms of a superabsorbent material that\u2019s been used in diapers for many years. The superabsorbent material looks like a tiny bead when it\u2019s dry and looks like a gel when it\u2019s wet (and mixed with the other fluffy fibers in the diaper). Superabsorbent material in diapers offers significant benefits, like drawing wetness away from baby\u2019s skin and helping to keep baby\u2019s skin healthy. In HUGGIES diapers, superabsorbent material is mixed with the fluffy diaper padding. This material turns liquid into a gel, helping to prevent leakage. Occasionally, you may see small beads of gel on the diaper or on your baby, but the gel is nontoxic and not harmful.

The statement from Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Huggies diapers, indicates that they are not aware of any broader product issues and that complaints of this nature are extremely rare. Additionally, they mention that their products undergo extensive safety testing and reviews, and the superabsorbent materials used in the diapers have been proven safe in numerous studies.

A portion of the release suggested that the illnesses were not necessarily due to standard use of products as intended. In a section titled \u201cwhat people should avoid,\u201d two of CDPHE\u2019s advisories stood out:Do not buy e-cigarette products off the street (for example, e-cigarette products with THC or other cannabinoids).Do not modify e-cigarette products or add any substances to these products that are not intended by the manufacturer.Local news reports made little effort to determine why cases presented in August 2019 when the practice of vaping or use of e-cigarettes had been fairly regular in the United States since at least\u00a02006. Scattered reports of\u00a0\u201csudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping\u201d began cropping up in the summer of 2019, but very few articles went into detail about what may have changed.On August 31 2019, the\u00a0New York Times published a far more in-depth article about clusters of \u201csudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping.\u201d It began:An 18-year-old showed up in a Long Island emergency room, gasping for breath, vomiting and dizzy. When a doctor asked if the teenager had been vaping, he said no.The patient\u2019s older brother, a police officer, was suspicious. He rummaged through the youth\u2019s room and found hidden vials of marijuana for vaping.\u201cI don\u2019t know where he purchased it. He doesn\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. Melodi Pirzada, chief pediatric pulmonologist at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y., who treated the young man. \u201cLuckily, he survived.\u201d\u2026Patients, mostly otherwise healthy and in their late teens and 20s, are showing up with severe shortness of breath, often after suffering for several days with vomiting, fever and fatigue. Some have wound up in the intensive care unit or on a ventilator for weeks. Treatment has been complicated by patients\u2019 lack of knowledge \u2014 and sometimes outright denial \u2014 about the actual substances they might have used or inhaled.That introduction was notable for two reasons: That the patient denied vaping overall, and that the patient was vaping products adulterated to contain cannabis in a state where such products are not available for regulated sale. The piece goes on to reiterate that patients were often unable or unwilling to disclose which substances they may have vaped before falling ill \u2014 understandably, if the substances were illicit or illegal.Instances of \u201csudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping\u201d did not appear to be striking older vapers, many of whom have long used mainstream vaping products. The cases highlighted by the New York\u00a0Times appeared to affect largely teenagers and young adults, and modification of vaping equipment to vape cannabis products was frequently cited.The article cited oils as a factor in many of the cases:\u201cInhaling oil into your lungs is extremely dangerous behavior that could result in death,\u201d said Thomas Eissenberg, who studies vaping at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cThat is probably the biggest message we can get out of this.\u201dMany vaping ingredients are not listed on the products. Vitamin E oil appears to have been a common substance associated with the severe and sudden respiratory problems in some of the New York cases, according to state health officials. It is not known how it was used. Vitamin E is sometimes advertised as a supplement in cannabidiol oil, which is not designed for vaping but has been used that way.Mainstream e-cigarette solutions for vaping, commonly known as \u201ce-juice\u201d or \u201cjuice,\u201d does not use oil as a carrier due to the danger inherent in vaping oils. Products purchased in stores contain nicotine, flavoring, propylene glycol, and\/or vegetable glycerin. E-cigarette manufacturers are presumably aware that vaping oil is dangerous and exclude it from their carrier solutions, whereas users modifying juices or delivery devices may not be aware of the risks when adulterating products in order to vape THC.Suspected modification of e-cigarettes to vape cannabis products is always present in reports on outbreaks of \u201csudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping.\u201d The Times article quoted a public safety expert:Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said he suspected a link to illicit products \u2014 perhaps related to ingredients including THC \u2014 because the main manufacturers of e-cigarettes had not suddenly altered their ingredients on a wide scale. \u201cIt\u2019s probably something new that has been introduced into the market by an illegal manufacturer, either a new flavor or a new way to emulsify THC that is causing these injuries,\u201d he said.Another public health expert consulted for the article interviewed a number of patients about the products they had inhaled before falling ill. She said \u201cinterviews with patients suggested they were getting the marijuana liquid from friends in states with legal supplies of the drug, like California and Colorado.\u201d The article goes on to highlight the intersection of regulated nicotine vaping products with the largely unregulated, federally illegal topic of cannabis products:The F.D.A. oversees CBD products sold as dietary supplements, but does not regulate THC, which is illegal under federal law. Liquid nicotine and THC, sometimes sold in cartridges for use in vaping devices, can each contain oils that may be safe to swallow but can damage the lung when vaporized into a mix of unknown chemicals.On August 30 2019, the Centers for Disease Control issued a public health advisory about cases of\u00a0\u201csudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping.\u201d In it, the CDC noted that \u201cmany patients have reported using e-cigarettes containing cannabinoid products such as THC or CBD\u201d before falling ill.In a section advising the public, the CDC recommended not modifying e-cigarette products and not buying them \u201coff the street\u201d:Regardless of the ongoing investigation, anyone who uses e-cigarette products should not buy these products off the street (e.g., e-cigarette products with THC, other cannabinoids) and should not modify e-cigarette products or add any substances to these products that are not intended by the manufacturer.Twitter user Amelia Howard shared an annotated version of the CDC advisory, noting portions where vague or confusing language obfuscated aspects of the notice:I used Hypothesis to make some annotations on The CDC's heath advisory on \"\"Severe Pulmonary Disease Associated with Using E-Cigarette Products\"\" You can read the advisory with my notes here: https:\/\/t.co\/TXTC5lb8Vg Click on the arrow at the top right to expand the comments.\u2014 Amelia Howard (@Amelia_RH) September 2, 2019Howard noted in part that no commercial product had been implicated, and that with the exception of one state, the cases were in states where THC products were not legally marketed or sold, and thus unregulated:The term \u201ce-cigarettes\u201d is commonly understood to mean nicotine vaping products, not THC oil pens\/cartridges. Based on the available evidence, it is quite clear that the majority, if not all of the observed cases are associated with the use of THC oils, most of which were accessed through the black market. Conversely, there is currently no evidence that any commercial nicotine vaping product has caused any one of the cases of pulmonary disease in the outbreak.By and large (and with the exception of California) the cases are clustered in states with no legal recreational cannabis market, and either extremely restrictive medical cannabis regulations, or no legal market for medical cannabis. In other words, the cases are happening in places where the black market is the only option for people who use cannabis recreationally.Howard referenced remarks from Dr. Michael Siegel, Professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health. Siegel explained that conflating common use of e-cigarettes with the illnesses likely caused by black-market products poses a risk to public health:This is a public health crisis and I think that any physician who makes public statements about these cases has a responsibility to provide accurate information that will actually help to prevent further cases from occurring. Scaring people into thinking that any vaping product can cause respiratory failure is not only inaccurate, but it is irresponsible because it doesn\u2019t provide useful information that can help youth avoid the specific products that are responsible for the observed cases.As an trained epidemiologist, it was immediately clear to me that these cases are not being caused by vaping products generally because these products have been on the market for years without any significant problems and because the reports are clustered in specific geographic areas. Now that further information is available, it is clear that the majority of the observed cases are associated with the use of THC oils that were obtained from unlicensed sellers. It is also likely that cases occurring among people using nicotine-containing e-liquids without THC are due to a contaminant that is appearing in products being sold on the black market, not in retail stores.Siegel concluded:In a disease outbreak such as this one, responsible public warnings need to be as specific as possible about the risk. In an outbreak of E. coli caused by a contaminated batch of lettuce, we don\u2019t tell the public that the disease is associated with eating, or even that it is associated with eating lettuce. People need much more specific guidance if they are to take appropriate action to avoid or reduce the risk of further spread of the outbreak.Here, we need to start telling the public the truth. However much physicians or anti-nicotine groups may not like it, the truth is that the outbreak we are seeing is not due to the risks of using standard vaping products. It appears much more likely that the outbreak is mostly, if not completely attributable to illicit products\u2013especially THC extracts\u2013that are being sold by unlicensed sellers on the black market. Unless people are provided with this specific information, they will not take action to avoid the products that could put them at risk.Some reporting on the outbreak mentioned a company \u2014 Dank Vapes \u2014 and its link to some of the cases. A Wisconsin man sickened by vaping black market items identified\u00a0a cartridge from Dank Vapes as the possible culprit. A\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0article\u00a0referenced Dank Vapes as a \u201cblack market brand of ambiguous origins,\u201d and referenced the case on Long Island and a vitamin E oil adulterant:Lab testing of [Dr. Melodi ] Pirzada\u2019s patient\u2019s cartridge revealed that it tested positive for not just THC, but also vitamin E. If inhaled, oils like Vitamin E can cause lipoid pneumonitis, a rare condition that results from fat particles being inhaled into the lungs, says Pirzada. When she submitted the results to the Department of Health, it informed her that there were two other cases of THC cartridges testing positive for vitamin E oil, though she says the cartridge is currently being retested for other substances.The viral Facebook post from the parent of a teenager hospitalized in Colorado due to \u201csudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping\u201d was a clearly emotional plea shared due to the illness of the girl in the photograph. Misinformation about\u00a0sudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping was rampant on social media in August 2019, due to clusters of the illness reported in several states.Although the poster said that it is not only unregulated products causing illness (which public health officials continue to investigate), all available information suggested that the illnesses indeed were likely attributable to adulterated vape products and not commercial e-cigarette components or juices. We have been so far unable to locate any reports associated solely with standard vaping or e-cigarette usage, and the illness seemed to strike young users. The nature of the mechanism of injury (suspected vaping of cannabis in states where it is illegal) suggests that some patients might not be willing to disclose that activity to doctors or parents.Cases of sudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping are real, and there is no reason to suspect that the Facebook post did not reference one such case. However, its focus on all vaping and e-cigarette products was misguided when read in contrast with commentary by public health experts. Although investigators struggled to identify a highly specific common factor in all the cases, most seemed to agree that e-cigarette cartridges and juice adulterated with oil and\/or cannabis products in states without legal dispensaries were likely to blame. Commercial vaping products existed for well over a decade in the United States before sudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping cases began popping up, but few if any illnesses linked directly to those products followed before the 2019 cases appeared.Update: September 5 2019, 4:48 PMOn September 5 2019, the\u00a0Washington Post reported that investigators identified a common thread in samples of cannabis products used by many patients with sudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping \u2014 vitamin E oil:State and federal health officials investigating mysterious lung illnesses linked to vaping have found the same chemical in samples of marijuana products used by people sickened in different parts of the country and who used different brands of products in recent weeks.The chemical is an oil derived from vitamin E. Investigators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found the oil in cannabis products in samples collected from patients who fell ill across the United States. FDA officials shared that information with state health officials during a telephone briefing this week, according to several officials who took part in the call.That same chemical was also found in nearly all cannabis samples from patients who fell ill in New York in recent weeks, a state health department spokeswoman said.\u2026 \u201cWe knew from earlier testing by New York that they had found vitamin E acetate, but to have FDA talk about it from their overall testing plan, that was the most remarkable thing that we heard,\u201d said one official who took part in the briefing but was not authorized to speak publicly.The Washington\u00a0Post further reported that state and federal health authorities said they were \u201cfocusing on the role of contaminants or counterfeit substances as a likely cause\u201d of the illnesses in question. Federal findings aligned with those in New York State, where \u201cvery high levels of vitamin E acetate in nearly all\u201d samples tested, and \u201cvitamin E acetate is now a key focus\u201d in the New York investigation. What makes the presence of vitamin E acetate so worrisome boils down to its unsuitable nature for inhalation:Unlike the human digestive tract, which can break down and get rid of foreign substances, the lungs aren\u2019t designed to handle anything except gases, experts said.When oils are inhaled, they are temporarily heated and vaporized. That heated and vaporized substance returns to its original state after it is inhaled, coating the inside of the user\u2019s lungs with oils. Inhaling products adulterated with oils such as vitamin E acetate can lead to a rare but serious condition known as lipoid pneumonia (less commonly called cholesterol pneumonia. )Literature from 1996 [PDF] described lipoid pneumonia as typically fatal; aspiration of oil-based substances such as laxatives have been previously identified as causes of lipoid pneumonia.Although authorities said they had not yet ruled out adulterants in nicotine-only samples, the Food and Drug Administration thus far has analyzed \u201c12 viable nicotine samples and 18 viable THC products,\u201d adding that \u201cVitamin E acetate was found in 10 of the 18 THC products.\u201d\u00a0By contrast, FDA lab tests found \u201cnothing unusual in nicotine products that had been collected from sick patients.\u201dIn a September 2019 bulletin issued in Oregon, health officials indicated that one sudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping death occurred in an individual who had recently used \u201can e-cigarette or vaping device containing cannabis.\u201d\"","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4516,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"\"On August 30 2019, a Facebook user shared a lengthy\u00a0post\u00a0(archived here) about her daughter Piper\u2019s purported illness, in a screed blaming \u201cvaping\u201d for the girl\u2019s condition.In the post, Johnson claimed that two weeks previously, her daughter became ill during a journey to college in Colorado and reported difficulty breathing.

That heated and vaporized substance returns to its original state after it is inhaled, coating the inside of the user\u2019s lungs with oils. Inhaling products adulterated with oils such as vitamin E acetate can lead to a rare but serious condition known as lipoid pneumonia (less commonly called cholesterol pneumonia. )Literature from 1996 [PDF] described lipoid pneumonia as typically fatal; aspiration of oil-based substances such as laxatives have been previously identified as causes of lipoid pneumonia.Although authorities said they had not yet ruled out adulterants in nicotine-only samples, the Food and Drug Administration thus far has analyzed \u201c12 viable nicotine samples and 18 viable THC products,\u201d adding that \u201cVitamin E acetate was found in 10 of the 18 THC products.\u201d\u00a0By contrast, FDA lab tests found \u201cnothing unusual in nicotine products that had been collected from sick patients.\u201dIn a September 2019 bulletin issued in Oregon, health officials indicated that one sudden and severe lung illness associated with vaping death occurred in an individual who had recently used \u201can e-cigarette or vaping device containing cannabis.\u201d\"\", and claim \"\"A teenager leaving for college in Colorado became severely ill due to \"\"vaping,\"\" or the standard use of an e-cigarette.\"\".

Some young women actually anticipate the wedding night ordeal with curiosity and pleasure! Beware such an attitude! A selfish and sensual husband can easily take advantage of such a bride. One cardinal rule of marriage should never be forgotten: GIVE LITTLE, GIVE SELDOM, AND ABOVE ALL, GIVE GRUDGINGLY. Otherwise what could have been a proper marriage could become an orgy of sexual lust. On the other hand, the bride\u2019s terror need not be extreme. While sex is at best revolting and at worse rather painful, it has to be endured, and has been by women since the beginning of time, and is compensated for by the monogamous home and by the children produced through it. It is useless, in most cases, for the bride to prevail upon the groom to forego the sexual initiation. While the ideal husband would be one who would approach his bride only at her request and only for the purpose of begetting offspring, such nobility and unselfishness cannot be expected from the average man. Most men, if not denied, would demand sex almost every day. The wise bride will permit a maximum of two brief sexual experiences weekly during the first months of marriage. As time goes by she should make every effort to reduce this frequency. Feigned illness, sleepiness, and headaches are among the wife\u2019s best friends in this matter. Arguments, nagging, scolding, and bickering also prove very effective, if used in the late evening about an hour before the husband would normally commence his seduction. Clever wives are ever on the alert for new and better methods of denying and discouraging the amorous overtures of the husband. A good wife should expect to have reduced sexual contacts to once a week by the end of the first year of marriage and to once a month by the end of the fifth year of marriage. By their tenth anniversary many wives have managed to complete their child bearing and have achieved the ultimate goal of terminating all sexual contacts with the husband. By this time she can depend upon his love for the children and social pressures to hold the husband in the home. Just as she should be ever alert to keep the quantity of sex as low as possible, the wise bride will pay equal attention to limiting the kind and degree of sexual contacts. Most men are by nature rather perverted, and if given half a chance, would engage in quite a variety of the most revolting practices. These practices include among others performing the normal act in abnormal positions; mouthing the female body; and offering their own vile bodies to be mouthed in turn. Nudity, talking about sex, reading stories about sex, viewing photographs and drawings depicting or suggesting sex are the obnoxious habits the male is likely to acquire if permitted. A wise bride will make it the goal never to allow her husband to see her unclothed body, and never allow him to display his unclothed body to her. Sex, when it cannot be prevented, should be practiced only in total darkness. Many women have found it useful to have thick cotton nightgowns for themselves and pajamas for their husbands. These should be donned in separate rooms. They need not be removed during the sex act. Thus, a minimum of flesh is exposed. Once the bride has donned her gown and turned off all the lights, she should lie quietly upon the bed and await her groom. When he comes groping into the room she should make no sound to guide him in her direction, lest he take this as a sign of encouragement. She should let him grope in the dark. There is always the hope that he will stumble and incur some slight injury which she can use as an excuse to deny him sexual access. When he finds her, the wife should lie as still as possible. Bodily motion on her part could be interpreted as sexual excitement by the optimistic husband. If he attempts to kiss her on the lips she should turn her head slightly so that the kiss falls harmlessly on her cheek instead. If he attempts to kiss her hand, she should make a fist. If he lifts her gown and attempts to kiss her anyplace else she should quickly pull the gown back in place, spring from the bed, and announce that nature calls her to the toilet. This will generally dampen his desire to kiss in the forbidden territory. If the husband attempts to seduce her with lascivious talk, the wise wife will suddenly remember some trivial non-sexual question to ask him. Once he answers she should keep the conversation going, no matter how frivolous it may seem at the time. Eventually, the husband will learn that if he insists on having sexual contact, he must get on with it without amorous embellishment. The wise wife will allow him to pull the gown up no farther than the waist, and only permit him to open the front of his pajamas to thus make connection. She will be absolutely silent or babble about her housework while his huffing and puffing away. Above all, she will lie perfectly still and never under any circumstances grunt or groan while the act is in progress. As soon as the husband has completed the act, the wise wife will start nagging him about various minor tasks she wishes him to perform on the morrow. Many men obtain a major portion of their sexual satisfaction from the peaceful exhaustion immediately after the act is over. Thus the wife must insure that there is no peace in this period for him to enjoy. Otherwise, he might be encouraged to soon try for more. One heartening factor for which the wife can be grateful is the fact that the husband\u2019s home, school, church, and social environment have been working together all through his life to instill in him a deep sense of guilt in regards to his sexual feelings, so that he comes to the marriage couch apologetically and filled with shame, already half cowed and subdued.

One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.The Daily Caller or CBN presumably inspired the sourceless Facebook post, which claimed that Pelosi and Democrats had tried to sneak funding for abortion into an unrelated coronavirus bill. But another top result for \u201cabortion coronavirus bill\u201d was a post on Reddit\u2019s r\/politics, featuring a title with inverse claims:Republicans Are Sneaking Abortion Restrictions into the Coronavirus Bill. Anti-choice lawmakers are stalling emergency legislation. from politicsThat r\/politics post linked to a Vice.com article, which in turn reported that anti-abortion lawmakers were \u201cstalling emergency legislation\u201d around COVID-19. Just as the Facebook post claimed Pelosi \u201cand the Dems\u201d were trying to \u201cslip\u201d funding for abortions into a coronavirus bill, Vice.com\u2019s report (\u201cRepublicans Tried to Sneak Abortion Restrictions into the Coronavirus Bill\u201d) involved \u201creport\u201d or \u201creportedly,\u201d beginning:As lawmakers neared a deal on a coronavirus rescue package that would include paid sick leave and free virus testing, a few roadblocks emerged. Among them: Republican attempts to wedge anti-choice restrictions into the House\u2019s relief bill, turning \u2014 if momentarily \u2014 a public health crisis into an abortion debate.The tensions reportedly revolved around the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old provision that blocks federal funds from going to abortion services, preventing millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid from accessing abortion care. [\u2026]According to conservative media, some top Republicans believed a stipulation in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories doing coronavirus testing could effectively overturn the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions. In response, anti-choice lawmakers insisted on including language in the legislation that would reaffirm the principles of the amendment.According to the Daily Caller, \u201cWhite House officials [said testing reimbursement] would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.\u201d Vice.com said \u201csome top Republicans believed a stipulation in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories doing coronavirus testing could effectively overturn the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions.\u201dBoth approaches described Republican concern over whether a portion of the bill involving reimbursement for laboratories \u2014 if not otherwise stipulated \u2014 would weaken the Hyde Amendment, which explicitly blocks use of federal funds for abortions, by establishing coronavirus-related streams of federal reimbursement not explicitly subject to restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion.Vice.com linked Vox as its source, which framed its March 12 2020 article as reporting on negotiations involving a coronavirus \u201ceconomic relief bill,\u201d which had nothing to do with abortion. Describing an announcement from House Democrats on March 11 2020, Vox.com noted that Republicans and Democrats were working on legislation to offset the financial impact of COVID-19 on Americans.In its fifth paragraph, the article mentioned abortion and the Hyde amendment:House Democrats released their coronavirus economic relief bill late [on March 11 2020, at] night, as layoffs related to the outbreak were reported. But the timing of when they\u2019ll vote on it is still up in the air nearly 24 hours later.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been negotiating the text of the bill with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin throughout the day on [March 12 2020]. The two had their fifth phone call shortly before 4 pm, her spokesperson said. (This piece will be updated as negotiations on the bill continue. )The new multibillion-dollar bill contains a number of emergency economic measures designed to assist working people and families dealing with the virus \u2014 including free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, and expanded unemployment benefits for those laid off related to the virus. Provisions in the bill expanding food assistance alone would cost $1 billion; a Congressional Budget Office score is expected.\u201cIt will be in the billions, and I won\u2019t go beyond that, but it will be costly,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) told reporters of the bill. \u201cBut I will tell you this: It will be much more costly if we don\u2019t provide relief.\u201d (For context, the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending was well over $1 trillion last year. )The impasse between Republicans and Democrats on the bill centers on two things; Republicans don\u2019t like a provision in the relief bill that would establish a permanent paid sick leave program, and Democrats are pushing back on Republicans wanting to add language referencing the Hyde amendment, which bans federal funds being used to pay for abortions.What is the Hyde Amendment? According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF.org), it came into existence shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision, and it prohibits public funding from being used on abortion or related services in all but a few circumstances:Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, abortion has been squarely in the middle of political debates at the national and state levels. Soon after the Court\u2019s ruling, Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funds from being used to pay for abortion outside of the exceptions for rape, incest, or if the pregnancy is determined to endanger the woman\u2019s life, resulting in dramatically limited coverage of abortion under Medicaid and other federal programs.In Vox\u2019s excerpt above, the words \u201c[Republicans] wanting to add language referencing the Hyde amendment\u201d linked to a March 12 2020 Roll Call item about expected action on the bill the following day (March 13 2020). However, the words \u201cabortion\u201d or \u201cHyde amendment\u201d did not appear in that\u00a0reporting:Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were nearing agreement on an economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic but weren\u2019t close enough to be ready for a vote [on the night of March 12 2020].After eight phone calls between the two, and several hours of meetings between Pelosi and top Democratic lawmakers, negotiations were set to continue into [March 12 2020].It\u2019s fair to say we are close to an agreement subject to the exchange of paper and hope to have an agreement tomorrow,\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., said late [on March 12 2020].If a deal is reached [March 13 2020], the House would vote on the package later in the day. But senators left town for the weekend [on the afternoon of March 12 2020] and can\u2019t take a roll call vote on the measure until [March 16 2020] at the earliest. Despite guidance from state and federal health officials to limit travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many senators planned to go back to their states this weekend before returning to the Hill on[March 16 2020].At the center of the negotiations is a dispute over paid leave provisions in the Democrats\u2019 initial bill. The legislation would require employers to let workers accrue seven days of leave that would apply in future public health emergencies, on top of an immediate 14 days of leave due to coronavirus-related work stoppages.Republicans have been pressing to use the incentive of tax credits to employers rather than government mandates to make paid emergency and sick leave available to workers, according to multiple sources who spoke on condition they not be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.Roll Call\u2019s reporting was in-depth, but it didn\u2019t describe any sort of dispute over abortion or the Hyde Amendment when discussing differences between Republicans and Democrats on the bill. The outlet described provisions sought by Democrats, but didn\u2019t mention taxpayer-funded abortion:The Democrat-authored aid package would offer, in addition to paid sick leave, expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance, free coverage of coronavirus testing and increased federal funding for state and territorial Medicaid costs, among other things.Over and again in most articles, talks between the parties were described as \u201csensitive,\u201d and sources for all reporting insisted they not be named.

Mnuchin reached a deal [March 13 2020] on an economic stimulus package to address the coronavirus, providing paid sick leave for workers and pumping billions of dollars to states for food programs and unemployment benefits.Pelosi announced the agreement [March 13 2020 in the] evening, not long after President Trump trashed it at an afternoon news conference.\u201cWe are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,\u201d she wrote in a letter to colleagues late [on March 13 2020].A few hours later, Trump tweeted his own endorsement. \u201cI encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!\u201d Trump wrote.The deal hit a last-minute hitch when some Republicans reportedly voiced concerns about some elements.As of March 16 2020, the bill passed the House and moved to the Senate; neither abortion nor the Hyde Amendment appeared in reporting on the bill\u2019s initial passage in the House and its move to the Senate.The claim we set out to fact-check held that Democrats and\/or Nancy Pelosi attempted \u201cto slip taxpayer funded abortion funding into a Coronavirus bill.\u201d But that\u2019s not what the Daily Caller \u2014 presumptively the first source for the claim \u2014 actually claimed in their reporting. Partisan outlets, both conservative and liberal, accused both parties respectively of delaying the bill as they haggled over abortion, but those same outlets described the same abortion coronavirus bill scenario in strikingly similar terms. Putting aside the fact all those pieces were predicated on \u201csources\u201d who refused to be named (thus making the claims unverifiable and indicating an internecine information battleground within the United States government), the Daily Caller didn\u2019t say that Pelosi or Democrats tried to \u201csneak\u201d or \u201cslip\u201d abortion funding into the coronavirus bill, but instead that that parties had debated whether laboratory reimbursement provisions need explicitly be subject to the Hyde Amendment. One day after the March 12 2020 articles appeared, an agreement was reached and the bill moved on to the Senate.Update, April 15 2020:\u00a0For additional information on the current status of coronavirus stimulus payments, or if your deposit has not arrived, please visit this page:Where is My Stimulus?

That is just sick Nancy and the DemsAs noted in previous fact-checks, images generated by text-based Facebook status updates remained a pernicious source for the spread of false information. The posts, which are limited to a small number of characters and with no linking functionality, are visually bold statements designed to circulate quickly, regardless of their\u00a0veracity.According to this particular rumor, Democrats (led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) attempted to \u201cslip\u201d provisions for \u201ctaxpayer funded abortion\u201d into a bill that is designed to fight the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Alas, no contextual information accompanied the claim, making it difficult for users to check whether it was true before sharing.And share it they did, with more than 44,000 users passing the claim forward as of March 16 2020. A cursory search for similar claims led to a CBN News item\u00a0headlined, \u201cReport: Pelosi Stalled Coronavirus Aid Bill by Trying to Sneak Abortion Funding Agenda into It\u201d:According to several White House officials, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to include federal funding for abortion in the coronavirus economic stimulus plan.In an exclusive story, The Daily Caller reports several officials allege that while Pelosi was negotiating the stimulus package with US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, she tried to lobby for \u201cseveral\u201d provisions which stalled bipartisan guarantees to the measure.CBN referenced the Daily Caller, whose piece\u00a0(\u201cEXCLUSIVE: White House Officials Allege Speaker Pelosi Pushed To Include Hyde Amendment Loophole Into Coronavirus Stimulus Plan\u201d) also leaned heavily on its status as a \u201creport,\u201d citing \u201csources\u201d in the White House:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to include a potential way to guarantee federal funding for abortion into the coronavirus economic stimulus plan, according to multiple senior White House officials.Speaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for \u201cseveral\u201d provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.The Daily Caller or CBN presumably inspired the sourceless Facebook post, which claimed that Pelosi and Democrats had tried to sneak funding for abortion into an unrelated coronavirus bill. But another top result for \u201cabortion coronavirus bill\u201d was a post on Reddit\u2019s r\/politics, featuring a title with inverse claims:Republicans Are Sneaking Abortion Restrictions into the Coronavirus Bill. Anti-choice lawmakers are stalling emergency legislation. from politicsThat r\/politics post linked to a Vice.com article, which in turn reported that anti-abortion lawmakers were \u201cstalling emergency legislation\u201d around COVID-19. Just as the Facebook post claimed Pelosi \u201cand the Dems\u201d were trying to \u201cslip\u201d funding for abortions into a coronavirus bill, Vice.com\u2019s report (\u201cRepublicans Tried to Sneak Abortion Restrictions into the Coronavirus Bill\u201d) involved \u201creport\u201d or \u201creportedly,\u201d beginning:As lawmakers neared a deal on a coronavirus rescue package that would include paid sick leave and free virus testing, a few roadblocks emerged. Among them: Republican attempts to wedge anti-choice restrictions into the House\u2019s relief bill, turning \u2014 if momentarily \u2014 a public health crisis into an abortion debate.The tensions reportedly revolved around the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old provision that blocks federal funds from going to abortion services, preventing millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid from accessing abortion care. [\u2026]According to conservative media, some top Republicans believed a stipulation in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories doing coronavirus testing could effectively overturn the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions. In response, anti-choice lawmakers insisted on including language in the legislation that would reaffirm the principles of the amendment.According to the Daily Caller, \u201cWhite House officials [said testing reimbursement] would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.\u201d Vice.com said \u201csome top Republicans believed a stipulation in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories doing coronavirus testing could effectively overturn the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions.\u201dBoth approaches described Republican concern over whether a portion of the bill involving reimbursement for laboratories \u2014 if not otherwise stipulated \u2014 would weaken the Hyde Amendment, which explicitly blocks use of federal funds for abortions, by establishing coronavirus-related streams of federal reimbursement not explicitly subject to restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion.Vice.com linked Vox as its source, which framed its March 12 2020 article as reporting on negotiations involving a coronavirus \u201ceconomic relief bill,\u201d which had nothing to do with abortion. Describing an announcement from House Democrats on March 11 2020, Vox.com noted that Republicans and Democrats were working on legislation to offset the financial impact of COVID-19 on Americans.In its fifth paragraph, the article mentioned abortion and the Hyde amendment:House Democrats released their coronavirus economic relief bill late [on March 11 2020, at] night, as layoffs related to the outbreak were reported. But the timing of when they\u2019ll vote on it is still up in the air nearly 24 hours later.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been negotiating the text of the bill with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin throughout the day on [March 12 2020]. The two had their fifth phone call shortly before 4 pm, her spokesperson said. (This piece will be updated as negotiations on the bill continue. )The new multibillion-dollar bill contains a number of emergency economic measures designed to assist working people and families dealing with the virus \u2014 including free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, and expanded unemployment benefits for those laid off related to the virus. Provisions in the bill expanding food assistance alone would cost $1 billion; a Congressional Budget Office score is expected.\u201cIt will be in the billions, and I won\u2019t go beyond that, but it will be costly,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) told reporters of the bill. \u201cBut I will tell you this: It will be much more costly if we don\u2019t provide relief.\u201d (For context, the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending was well over $1 trillion last year. )The impasse between Republicans and Democrats on the bill centers on two things; Republicans don\u2019t like a provision in the relief bill that would establish a permanent paid sick leave program, and Democrats are pushing back on Republicans wanting to add language referencing the Hyde amendment, which bans federal funds being used to pay for abortions.What is the Hyde Amendment? According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF.org), it came into existence shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision, and it prohibits public funding from being used on abortion or related services in all but a few circumstances:Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, abortion has been squarely in the middle of political debates at the national and state levels. Soon after the Court\u2019s ruling, Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funds from being used to pay for abortion outside of the exceptions for rape, incest, or if the pregnancy is determined to endanger the woman\u2019s life, resulting in dramatically limited coverage of abortion under Medicaid and other federal programs.In Vox\u2019s excerpt above, the words \u201c[Republicans] wanting to add language referencing the Hyde amendment\u201d linked to a March 12 2020 Roll Call item about expected action on the bill the following day (March 13 2020). However, the words \u201cabortion\u201d or \u201cHyde amendment\u201d did not appear in that\u00a0reporting:Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were nearing agreement on an economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic but weren\u2019t close enough to be ready for a vote [on the night of March 12 2020].After eight phone calls between the two, and several hours of meetings between Pelosi and top Democratic lawmakers, negotiations were set to continue into [March 12 2020].It\u2019s fair to say we are close to an agreement subject to the exchange of paper and hope to have an agreement tomorrow,\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., said late [on March 12 2020].If a deal is reached [March 13 2020], the House would vote on the package later in the day. But senators left town for the weekend [on the afternoon of March 12 2020] and can\u2019t take a roll call vote on the measure until [March 16 2020] at the earliest. Despite guidance from state and federal health officials to limit travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many senators planned to go back to their states this weekend before returning to the Hill on[March 16 2020].At the center of the negotiations is a dispute over paid leave provisions in the Democrats\u2019 initial bill. The legislation would require employers to let workers accrue seven days of leave that would apply in future public health emergencies, on top of an immediate 14 days of leave due to coronavirus-related work stoppages.Republicans have been pressing to use the incentive of tax credits to employers rather than government mandates to make paid emergency and sick leave available to workers, according to multiple sources who spoke on condition they not be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.Roll Call\u2019s reporting was in-depth, but it didn\u2019t describe any sort of dispute over abortion or the Hyde Amendment when discussing differences between Republicans and Democrats on the bill. The outlet described provisions sought by Democrats, but didn\u2019t mention taxpayer-funded abortion:The Democrat-authored aid package would offer, in addition to paid sick leave, expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance, free coverage of coronavirus testing and increased federal funding for state and territorial Medicaid costs, among other things.Over and again in most articles, talks between the parties were described as \u201csensitive,\u201d and sources for all reporting insisted they not be named. In the same article, a summary of Republican provisions also appeared:Republicans have been pressing to use the incentive of tax credits to employers rather than government mandates to make paid emergency and sick leave available to workers, according to multiple sources who spoke on condition they not be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.On March 13 2020, the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported Democrats and Republicans hammered out an agreement on an economic stimulus bill during the coronavirus pandemic.

Also, a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared July 7, 2010. See the note and letter at the end of this story. When we read a recent news release issued by state Rep. Kevin Levitas (D-DeKalb County), we thought back to a small town named Blakely. His announcement said that Gov. Sonny Perdue\u2019s signing of the Sanitary Activity for Food-Processing Enterprises Act celebrated the strength of the state\u2019s food-safety system:  \"\"Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety, and the SAFE Act continues our state\u2019s long tradition of protecting the consuming public,\"\" Levitas said in the release. \"\"An overwhelming majority of food processors in Georgia keep quality and safety as their primary concerns. The SAFE Act is intended to keep out the bad actors and punish the few who put profit over human life and safety.\"\" Georgia-produced peanut butter took a huge hit a few years back. The South Georgia town of Blakely was the home to a Peanut Corporation of America plant that helped spawn one of the biggest outbreaks of food-borne illness in the nation\u2019s history. The salmonella outbreak in late 2008 sickened about 700 and was linked to nine deaths nationwide. Georgia Agriculture Department plant inspection reports showed grease and dirt buildup on equipment, unmarked chemical containers and gaps in doors large enough for rodents to scuttle through. One worker testified before Congress that she spotted roaches and rodents inside. Blakely came to symbolize Georgia\u2019s lax culture of food-safety regulation. In 2007, salmonella from ConAgra Foods in Sylvester, the maker of Peter Pan peanut butter, made more than 600 people ill. That same year, botulism was found in canned chili from a plant in Augusta. It was the first outbreak of botulism from commercially canned foods in nearly four decades. Can a state that produced a tainted peanut butter that killed nine people set the \"\"gold standard\"\" for food safety? It\u2019s hard to establish what a \"\"gold standard\"\" might be in the food safety arena. No ranking of state programs exists because it\u2019s difficult to come up with a good way of scoring them. When we asked experts to name states with good systems, they cited Oregon, Minnesota and New York. Not Georgia. We asked Levitas for evidence backing his claim. He said that since the outbreak, the state Legislature has strengthened food-safety laws in two crucial ways: It created a requirement that food processors alert the state within 24 hours when tainted food is discovered, and it made it a felony for food processors to knowingly release\u00a0 contaminated products to the public. The reporting requirement is the result of 2009\u2019s Senate Bill 80, which was passed in response to the peanut butter scare. Food processing safety experts we talked with had not heard of another state with a similar rule, so Georgia is unique in this regard. The problem is that the reporting rule applies to only a portion of food processors. A loophole allows food processors who submit a special \"\"written food safety plan\"\" to avoid being subject to the 24-hour reporting standard, according to the text of the bill, media coverage and interviews with experts. So while this requirement may be unusual, its impact is limited. This year\u2019s House Bill 883 made the knowing release of tainted products to the public a felony in Georgia. Experts said this state law is unusual but the act is already a crime under federal law. Levitas said it was necessary to make releasing tainted food a crime on the state level to help local prosecutors. It\u2019s easier to prosecute a bad food producer in court when there is a death of a consumer if it was the result of a state crime, he said. There are other ways to measure the strength of Georgia\u2019s food-safety system. Some states are better than others at figuring out the cause of an outbreak. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog group, Georgia had 283 tainted food outbreaks between 1998 and 2007. Ninety-nine were solved, said David Plunkett, a staff attorney for the group. \"\"We\u2019d say Georgia is fair to middling,\"\" Plunkett said. Another sign of a good food safety program is adherence to the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program, which was created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state food-safety regulators, said Joe Corby, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials and a respected food-safety expert. These standards, which Corby said are difficult to meet, establish requirements for inspector training, inspection, self-auditing and other procedures. Georgia is among 25 states implementing the program, according to the organization. That\u2019s good, but not great. While Georgia legislators have passed new and sometimes unique food-safety regulations since the peanut butter scare, this state is far short of setting a gold standard. Georgia has a history of major food-safety lapses that have killed and debilitated consumers, and the laws passed in response are limited. Update: A June 13 item on Rep. Kevin Levitas' statement that Georgia sets \"\"the gold standard\"\" on food safety contained a factual error. PolitiFact Georgia said that a new food safety law has a loophole that exempts some processors from having to report tainted food to the state within 24 hours. That's not the case.

The mean age at death in the right-handed sample was 75 years, as compared with the life-span for the left-handers is significant (Fl,945 = 22.36, P<0.0001). Critics of these studies have noted that their methodologies are flawed, as they assume an static\u00a0proportion of left and right handed people throughout time \u2014 despite the fact that many people who were born in early 1900s were likely pressured to become right-handed at an early age, and would not identify as left-handed at death. Historical records support this argument, presented in the book Language Lateralization and Psychosis: About 90% of people are right-handed and 10% are lefthanded [\u2026]. It is probable that about 8% to 10% of the population has been left-handed for at least the past 200 000 years or so. Detailed data only began to become available for those born in the nineteenth century, and there is growing evidence that the rate of left-handedness fell precipitously during the Victorian period, reaching a nadir of about 3% in about 1895 or so, and then rising quite quickly until an asymptote is reached for those born after about 1945 to 1950, with 11% to 12% of men and 9% to 10% of women typically being left-handed in Western countries.

In the headline, main text and quotes, the release makes unjustified claims about treatment effectiveness, claiming SBRT can \u201csafely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it.\u201d However, the study was merely a look back at a few dozen cases that produced results the researchers considered evidence that age, by itself, should not disqualify patients. There was no comparison group that would allow any conclusions about effectiveness, including longer survival. The release does not mention cost nor does it report funding or author disclosures. Many research studies investigating the benefits and risks of various therapies exclude very old individuals. As such, it is often difficult to provide evidence-based recommendations for this population. A study of elderly people, if evidence-based, would be helpful to patients, their families and physicians. But it is important for news releases to be clear about what was studied and what was not. This summary of the experience of a few dozen elderly patients may provide some assurance that patients should not be disqualified from considering SBRT for early stage lung cancer merely because they are old. However, there was no control group, no comparison to other treatments that would support claims of effectiveness and added years of life. Muddling study results with the opinions of researchers that are based on their clinical experience or interpretation of other studies produces a confusing picture of the evidence or lack thereof.","premise":"The release does not report the cost of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or any alternatives a patient could consider. The release provides some data on benefits with this statement: \u201cAt two years following definitive SBRT for lung cancer among elderly patients, survival rates were 73 percent for cancer specific survival (CSS) and 57 percent for overall survival (OS).\u201d So the release is claiming that SBRT can add years to the lives of elderly patients. But the study was merely a review of a series of cases and did not actually compare SBRT to any other treatment, so it provides no direct evidence of a survival benefit. The same section of the release refers to other studies, but provides no numerical description of the benefits from the other studies. In fact, other studies have relied on comparisons to historical controls, not randomized trials, so even though SBRT has become standard care for this sort of lung cancer patient when surgery is not an option, there is a lack of evidence about the precise benefits. The release reports that just over one-third of the 58 patients experienced radiation pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), and that two had cases severe enough to possibly require oxygen or steroid treatment. However, the release does not mention other harms of this sort of radiation treatment, which can include fatigue lasting for several weeks, neuropathic pain, rib fractures and other problems. There is no mention of any measurements of these other radiation effects. The release reports that the study was a retrospective analysis of 58 patients with different types of tumors \u2014 adenocarcinomas (40 percent), squamous cell carcinomas (29 percent) and those not diagnosed with biopsy (31 percent). Half of those not receiving a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer. The fact that more than one-third of the tumors treated were not categorized is concerning. We would have liked to see a clear note that this study was neither randomized nor blinded and that the study design is not able to provide evidence of effectiveness. Without this sort of clarifying statement, the release relies on readers to understand the generally low quality of evidence that a retrospective case series produces. Because the results are not compared to any other treatments, it is impossible to state whether the treatment offered benefit, and if it did, how much. It should be clear to readers that this study applies only to elderly patients with early stage lung cancer who are not able to undergo surgery.

The use of \u201ccurative\u201d in the headline and the suggestion that SBRT is a \u201ccurative treatment\u201d is misleading. The release doesn\u2019t say whether the tumors treated originated in the lung or if they metastasized from some other part of the body.

Particularly in the case of metastasized tumors, the treatment would be \u201cpalliative,\u201d but not curative. The claims of treatment effectiveness and added survival are not supported by this study. What\u2019s more, evidence from other studies is weaker than the release implies. It is not justifiable for a researcher to plainly state the \u201cSBRT can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients\u201d when the study did not compare treatments. It would have been better for the release to limit itself to the actual results of the study; that is, that this group of elderly patients appeared to do as well as their doctors expected, and so age itself should not be used to disqualify patients from considering SBRT.\", and claim \"SBRT Offers Curative Option for Lung Cancer Patients Age 80 and Older\".

The claim of SBRT being a curative option for lung cancer patients age 80 and older lacks sufficient evidence to support it.","explanation_gpt4":"The claim \"SBRT Offers Curative Option for Lung Cancer Patients Age 80 and Older\" is false because the study referenced in the evidence was a retrospective case series that did not compare SBRT to any other treatments, nor was it randomized or blinded. This means there is no direct evidence from the study to support the effectiveness of SBRT as a curative treatment compared to other options. Additionally, the study design itself (retrospective case series) is generally considered to provide a lower quality of evidence. The claim overstates the conclusions that can be drawn from the study, as it does not establish SBRT as definitively curative, especially since it does not clarify whether the tumors treated were primary lung cancers or metastases from other areas, which would influence the interpretation of SBRT as curative or palliative."}
{"claim_id":"24281","hypothesis":"Rick Perry Says his executive order requiring young girls to be vaccinated against HPV wasn't mandatory.","explanation_1":"Perry says the HPV vaccine he mandated would have been optional","premise":"\"When Gov. Rick Perry issued an executive order in 2007 requiring all Texas girls to receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus before entering the sixth grade, lawmakers balked and blocked it. Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, one of Perry's opponents in the GOP gubernatorial primary, frequently slams Perry's stilled order. Perry has stood by his action, most recently casting it as having created an optional vaccination requirement. \"\"That piece of legislation was not mandatory, in the sense of when you can say no, something's not mandatory,\"\" he said during the second Republican gubernatorial debate Jan. 29. A just-say-no gubernatorial order? We decided to check. What we found: On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order \u2014 not a piece of legislation, as he said \u2014 requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade to receive a vaccination against the types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, that causes most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. The order included an opt-out \"\"in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care.\"\" Perry ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form, which has been available since 2003, enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information. According to the Department of State Health Service's 2008-09 immunization report, which uses data from kindergarten and seventh-grade students at 1,300 independent school districts and 800 private schools, 0.28 percent of the students filed conscientious objection forms. Parents must renew exemption affidavits every two years to maintain their validity, according to Allison Lowery, assistant press officer at the Texas Department of State Health Services. We thought the opt-out form for public-school students proved Perry correct until we learned that not all private schools accept the affidavit. That means some private schools may not allow their students to exempt themselves from any state-required vaccinations. Some 15 percent of more than 1 million Texas girls in fifth through 12th grade in 2008 were enrolled in private schools, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. According to a 2006 Texas Attorney General's opinion: \"\"A private school that does not accept state tax funds is not required to accept for enrollment a child who has received an exemption from the immunizations required by the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"\" In its policy for Catholic schools, the Catholic Diocese of Austin states: \"\"Immunizations are not in conflict with the Catholic faith. Conscientious objections or waivers, which may be permissible for enrollment in public schools, do not qualify as an exception to this policy.\"\" Catholic schools in the diocese do accept medical exemptions, meaning if the immunization could somehow harm the child, it's not required to enroll. We wondered if the diocese's policy in favor of requiring state-mandated immunizations would have extended to refusing the opt-out form for girls subject to the HPV vaccination. Perry aides may have had the same question. According to internal e-mails published online by Hutchison's campaign (also obtained by the Austin American-Statesman under Texas open records laws in 2007), Brandon LeBlanc, then the governor's community affairs public liaison, wrote Feb. 6, 2007: \"\"I don't have an answer for the questions I'm getting regarding private schools.

This trustworthy old friend so often invited to our tables can, at times, slip us a little bit of poison. The potato \u2014 or, rather, green versions of it \u2014 contains a natural toxin called solanine. The greenish hue that should warn you away from such spuds is actually chlorophyll, but its presence indicates concentrations of solanine are present in the tuber. A glycoalkaloid poison found in species of the nightshade, solanine is a nerve toxin produced in the green part of the potato (the leaves, the stem, and any green spots on the skin). This bitter poisonous crystalline alkaloid is part of the plant\u2019s defenses against insects, disease, and predators. Potato leaves and stems are naturally high in glycoalkaloids, so ingestion of these parts of the plant should be avoided. Solanine develops in potatoes when spuds are subjected to light or either very cold or very warm temperatures. The toxin interferes with the body\u2019s ability to use a particular chemical that facilitates the transmission of impulses between cells. Ingested in large enough amounts, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and even paralysis of the central nervous system. However, unless you are deliberately seeking out green potatoes to eat, you are unlikely to ingest enough of the toxin to do harm.

While it is true that green potatoes contain solanine, a toxic compound which can cause nausea, headache, and other neurological symptoms if ingested in large quantities, the levels of solanine in slightly green potatoes are generally not high enough to pose a serious health risk for most adults. The typical consumption levels of these potatoes would not provide enough solanine to cause poisoning.

{"claim_id":"16898","hypothesis":"Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes.","explanation_1":"\"The DCCC said \"\"Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes.\"\" The DCCC points to some votes that went against funding certain veterans\u2019 services or addressing the backlog. However, the DCCC ignores that Duffy took other votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans\u2019 services -- just not as much as Democratic proposals would have offered. The bigger issue is that most of these votes came within elaborate games of tit-for-tat, in which each side offers proposals that they expect will fail, just to get lawmakers on the other side to take votes that look superficially bad. The reality of Duffy\u2019s voting record is much more nuanced than the DCCC\u2019s cherry-picked account would suggest. This, combined with the \"\"A-minus\"\" rating he's received from a veterans' advocacy group, undercut the DCCC's claim that he has a \"\"long\"\" voting record of voting against the interests of veterans.\"","premise":"\"As President Barack Obama faced attacks over long waits for appointments at Veterans Administration health centers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm -- engaged in some finger-pointing. The DCCC sent out a news release claiming that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) \u00a0-- and other Republicans -- voted against fixing the VA backlog. Here is part of the June 2, 2014 news release, which was headlined \"\"Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes.\"\" \"\"As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congressman Sean Duffy\u2019s votes tell the true story of his record: when he had a chance to fix this problem, he voted against the fixes.\"\" The release went on to quote DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin saying, \"\"It\u2019s a shame that when Congressman Duffy had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA he voted no. Congressman Duffy voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better.\"\" PolitiFact National rated a similar DCCC claim against U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami and rated it . (The DCCC issued a series of virtually identical news releases) Leaning heavily on PolitiFact National\u2019s work, here is a look at how the claim fares when used against Duffy. VA backlog In the item on Ros-Lehtinen, PolitiFact reporter Amy Sherman wrote: We should start by distinguishing between two related, but separate, issues relating to veterans. One concerns longstanding problems with handling benefits claims from veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die as a result of their service. The other concerns long waits for service at VA hospitals. On the first issue -- benefits -- the backlog refers to requests that go unaddressed by the government for at least 125 days. PolitiFact found that the backlog nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in the summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012. In April 2014, the Obama administration released numbers suggesting the backlog was shrinking, but veterans groups said they had serious doubts about the numbers. The second issue -- the wait for health care -- stemmed from news reports that revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, and that some veterans died while awaiting care. This is what ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30. The DCCC essentially conflates the two issues in the quest to highlight any vote that portrays Duffy \u00a0as voting against veterans\u2019 interests. Of course, political groups tend to cherry-pick the records of their opponent. As the Ros-Lehtinen \u00a0item noted: It\u2019s possible to dig up a vote made by virtually any member of Congress of either party and claim that the politician is for -- or against -- anything, including veterans benefits. So, just as the Democrats were able to find some votes in which Duffy voted against a service for veterans, there are other votes which he voted for veterans\u2019 services. Many of the votes that the DCCC cited were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes. In most of the instances, the votes broke down overwhelmingly on party lines, with Duffy joining his Republican colleagues. That said, let\u2019s start with the votes that are directly about the backlog: The votes \u2022 Veterans Backlog Reduction Act: A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. William Enyart, D-Ill., ordered the VA to provisionally pay any disability claim if the VA didn\u2019t respond within 125 days. Enyart introduced the bill in April 2013 and it was referred to the House committee on Veterans Affairs. It never received a vote. The DCCC said Duffy voted against considering that bill by pointing to a vote on the \"\"previous question\"\" -- a parliamentary move to force a vote. During a debate about a higher education bill, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. stated \"\"if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will allow the House to vote on the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act.\"\" Enyart then explained his veterans\u2019 bill and urged a \"\"no\"\" vote. His fellow Democrats complied and all voted \"\"no\"\" while the Republicans voted \"\"yes,\"\" which defeated his effort. Something the DCCC omitted is that in October 2013, Duffy had voted to establish a commission or task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That measure passed, 404-1. \u2022 Increasing funds to reduce the backlog in disability claims: The DCCC said Duffy \u00a0voted no, along with nearly every Republican, on a motion that would have added $9.2 million to hire an additional 94 VA claims processors tasked with reducing the disability claims backlog. The June 2013 motion was a \"\"motion to recommit\"\" on an appropriations bill to fund military construction and veterans affairs. A \"\"motion to recommit\"\" in the House refers to a last-ditch attempt by the minority party to amend a bill before it passes. Left unsaid: The overall bill, which did pass, provided money to address the backlog, just not as much as Democrats proposed. \u2022 Mental health funds: On June 2, 2011, Congress agreed in a voice vote to set aside $20 million for suicide prevention for veterans. On June 14, 2011, Duffy voted against a Democratic motion to recommit that would add $20 million for veterans\u2019 suicide prevention. The GOP argued that such services were already funded, and the motion failed. Duffy, along with nearly every member of Congress, voted for the overall bill, which increased money for the military. The bill included an additional $20 million for suicide prevention outreach, according to Congressional Quarterly. \u2022 Medical and prosthetic research: In May 2012, Duffy joined all but three Republicans in voting against a motion to recommit that would have increased funding for veterans\u2019 medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. Here too, Duffy joined the overwhelming majority in passing the overall bill. The bill provided a $1.7 million increase for medical, rehabilitative, health services and prosthetic research -- an amount equal to the Obama administration\u2019s request, according to CQ. The DCCC also cited votes Duffy took leading up to the October 2013 federal shutdown. In August, he voted for a House Republican \"\"continuing resolution\"\" -- a stopgap funding bill -- that the Associated Press reported would \"\"likely result\"\" in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. The shutdown led to a delay in death benefits for veterans among other delayed services, the Washington Post reported. DCCC also cited a pair of votes Duffy took in September, including one on a motion to commit to H.J. Res. 59, to make continuing appropriations that would have ensured veterans benefits wouldn\u2019t be delayed during a shutdown. All but one Republican voted \"\"no.\"\" However, left out of the DCCC\u2019s account is that Duffy voted for in favor of H.J. Res. 72, the \"\"Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution\"\" -- a mini-funding resolution favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The measure passed the House with unanimous Republican support and overwhelming Democratic opposition. (Showing how both sides play this game, the RNC plucked out that vote to attack DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a claim we rated .) Democrats also cited multiple other votes including a few that related to housing for veterans but Republicans could point to other votes on bills that did provide housing assistance. Veterans\u2019 group report card Meanwhile, we found a veterans\u2019 organization that issue voting \"\"report cards\"\" for members of Congress: The American Veterans (Amvets) gave Duffy an A-minus in 2013, based on eight pieces of legislation. In response to questions from PolitiFact National, DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner said, \"\"These Republicans\u2019 votes speak for themselves. Taken in their totality, they show an unfortunate pattern of refusing to cross party lines and vote for commonsense fixes to the problems at the VA.\"\" However, we don't think the votes chosen show the \"\"totality\"\" of Duffy\u2019s record. Our rating The DCCC said \"\"Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes.\"\" The DCCC points to some votes that went against funding certain veterans\u2019 services or addressing the backlog. However, the DCCC ignores that Duffy took other votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans\u2019 services -- just not as much as Democratic proposals would have offered. The bigger issue is that most of these votes came within elaborate games of tit-for-tat, in which each side offers proposals that they expect will fail, just to get lawmakers on the other side to take votes that look superficially bad. The reality of Duffy\u2019s voting record is much more nuanced than the DCCC\u2019s cherry-picked account would suggest. This, combined with the \"\"A-minus\"\" rating he's received from a veterans' advocacy group, undercut the DCCC's claim that he has a \"\"long\"\" voting record of voting against the interests of veterans.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":4957,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"\"As President Barack Obama faced attacks over long waits for appointments at Veterans Administration health centers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm -- engaged in some finger-pointing. The DCCC sent out a news release claiming that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) \u00a0-- and other Republicans -- voted against fixing the VA backlog. Here is part of the June 2, 2014 news release, which was headlined \"\"Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes.\"\" \"\"As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congressman Sean Duffy\u2019s votes tell the true story of his record: when he had a chance to fix this problem, he voted against the fixes.\"\" The release went on to quote DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin saying, \"\"It\u2019s a shame that when Congressman Duffy had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA he voted no. Congressman Duffy voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better.\"\" PolitiFact National rated a similar DCCC claim against U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami and rated it . (The DCCC issued a series of virtually identical news releases) Leaning heavily on PolitiFact National\u2019s work, here is a look at how the claim fares when used against Duffy. VA backlog In the item on Ros-Lehtinen, PolitiFact reporter Amy Sherman wrote: We should start by distinguishing between two related, but separate, issues relating to veterans. One concerns longstanding problems with handling benefits claims from veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die as a result of their service. The other concerns long waits for service at VA hospitals. On the first issue -- benefits -- the backlog refers to requests that go unaddressed by the government for at least 125 days. PolitiFact found that the backlog nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in the summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012. In April 2014, the Obama administration released numbers suggesting the backlog was shrinking, but veterans groups said they had serious doubts about the numbers. The second issue -- the wait for health care -- stemmed from news reports that revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, and that some veterans died while awaiting care. This is what ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30. The DCCC essentially conflates the two issues in the quest to highlight any vote that portrays Duffy \u00a0as voting against veterans\u2019 interests. Of course, political groups tend to cherry-pick the records of their opponent. As the Ros-Lehtinen \u00a0item noted: It\u2019s possible to dig up a vote made by virtually any member of Congress of either party and claim that the politician is for -- or against -- anything, including veterans benefits. So, just as the Democrats were able to find some votes in which Duffy voted against a service for veterans, there are other votes which he voted for veterans\u2019 services. Many of the votes that the DCCC cited were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes. In most of the instances, the votes broke down overwhelmingly on party lines, with Duffy joining his Republican colleagues. That said, let\u2019s start with the votes that are directly about the backlog: The votes \u2022 Veterans Backlog Reduction Act: A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. William Enyart, D-Ill., ordered the VA to provisionally pay any disability claim if the VA didn\u2019t respond within 125 days. Enyart introduced the bill in April 2013 and it was referred to the House committee on Veterans Affairs. It never received a vote. The DCCC said Duffy voted against considering that bill by pointing to a vote on the \"\"previous question\"\" -- a parliamentary move to force a vote. During a debate about a higher education bill, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. stated \"\"if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will allow the House to vote on the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act.\"\" Enyart then explained his veterans\u2019 bill and urged a \"\"no\"\" vote. His fellow Democrats complied and all voted \"\"no\"\" while the Republicans voted \"\"yes,\"\" which defeated his effort.

Please explain why the claim is False.","explanation_llama":"The claim \"Congressman Duffy has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes\" is False. While Duffy did vote against some specific measures related to the VA backlog, he also voted in favor of other measures that addressed the issue. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) selectively presented a limited number of votes to create the impression that Duffy consistently opposed fixes to the VA backlog, but this ignores his votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans' services and other measures. Additionally, the DCCC's cherry-picked account of Duffy's votes is misleading, as many of the votes were procedural or part of a larger legislative package.","explanation_gpt35":"The claim that Congressman Duffy has a long record of voting against VA backlog fixes is false because the evidence provided shows that he did take some votes in favor of addressing the backlog, such as establishing a task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims and voting for measures to increase funding for veterans' services.","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that \"Congressman Duffy has a long record of voting against VA backlog fixes\" is rated as False because it selectively highlights a few votes where Congressman Duffy voted against specific veterans' services or funding proposals, while ignoring other instances where he voted in favor of measures designed to address or improve veterans' services. The DCCC's claim overlooks the complexity of legislative voting, where votes can often be strategic and influenced by broader party lines or legislative tactics. Additionally, the claim does not account for Duffy's votes that supported veterans' services or his overall voting record, which included supporting legislation that benefited veterans. Moreover, the American Veterans (Amvets) awarded Duffy an A-minus rating, indicating a positive assessment of his support for veterans-related legislation, which further contradicts the DCCC's claim. Thus, the characterization of Duffy's voting record as predominantly against veterans' interests is misleading and does not reflect the totality of his actions and stances in Congress."}

You\u2019re letting the LBGTQ \u201ccommunity\u201doutsmart you. If they want to demand that society accept their horseshit identities, then it\u2019s time we slip in one of our own, for godly keks. How do we do this? We convince them that Pedos deserve rights too. Think about it, if this were to catch any traction at all it would only further remove any legitimization they\u2019ve gained. Flood twitter with #lgbtp and #loveisageless with pics like this\u00a0  This. You have to just act like it\u2019s another form of sexual identification. No love is ageless shit. You have to get a Tumblr thing going with legit stuff first, and then eventually start slow, and then post that one and keep pushing it, eventually people will fight for molester rights! Nor was it the last time a 4chan group tried this. A January 2017\u00a0thread\u00a0titled \u201cLGBTP General: Subversive Memesmithing Edition\u201d laid out further plans to spread the idea that the LGBT community supports pedophilia: Greetings, I come to you as a humble meming acolyte. I would like to propose a PsyOp centered around generating disgust for the burgeoning pedophile acceptance movement. This op, as you can probably deduce, will introduce fracture points in the LGBT movement by adding a \u201cP\u201d for pedophilia to their title. The left has continued to push perversions and this nudge will further polarize public sentiment for \/ against LGBT. This op, if it gained traction, would have several benefits:\u00a0 First, you associate that community with a blight that in fact is realistic \u2013 we all know faggots molest children at an alarming rate. Second, it D\/Cs the LGBT(P) community, some of whom will actually ACCEPT these vermin into their ranks. This is incredibly damaging from a PR standpoint, as in lose-your-job \/ all public support damaging. Third, it encourages more people to out themselves out of a perceived security, which is nothing but an illusion manufactured (by us \/ cooperatives in the know) to destroy them. Phase 1 \u2013 Introduce OC. Push pedo acceptance particularly on the LGBT bandwagon via twitter sockpuppets etc. Offline, letters to editors and \/ or news orgs as an \u201coppressed person due to my sexual preferences.\u201d Imagine if your 5pm news ran a story on this? Phase 2 \u2013 Dox pedos (they bring it upon themselves, as in Heart Progress), utilize national sex offender registry, familywatchdog.us actually specifies \u201coffense against minor\u201d Compile a list. Phase 3 \u2013 Distribute dox \/ propoganda in local settings, use your imagination. Here is some OC, in dire need of polishing to reach normies. Fire up GIMP and twitter puppets and let the triggering commence. Possible hashtags:\u00a0 WeArentMonsters GaysForPedoSexuality ConsentToLove ChooseNotAbuse Troll accounts posing as supporters of the \u201cLGBTP\u201d movement and at least one account posing as an official \u201cLGBTQP\u201d organization started to push the narrative on Twitter:  To be clear, no LGBT organization has ever come out in favor of child molestation. Furthermore, this attempt to link homosexuality to pedophilia was rooted in bigotry, not statistics: An especially pernicious myth is that most adults who sexually abuse children are gay. A number of researchers have looked at this question to determine if homosexuals are more likely to be\u00a0pedophiles\u00a0than heterosexuals, and the data indicate that\u2019s not the case. For example, in a 1989 study led by Kurt Freund of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry in Canada, scientists showed pictures of children to adult gay and straight males, and measured sexual arousal. Homosexual men reacted no more strongly to pictures of male children than heterosexual men reacted to pictures of female children.\", and claim \"\"The group LGBT is adding a \"\"P\"\" to their name in order to represent pedosexuals.\"\".

So when Republican candidate for attorney general Erik Wallin issued a news release warning voters that his opponent, Democrat Peter Kilmartin, voted to allow sex offenders to shave time off their prison sentences for good behavior, it caught our attention. His claim began like this: \"\"Erik Wallin, candidate for Attorney General, today criticized Representative Kilmartin for his vote in favor of expanding the 'good behavior' statute to sex offenders and called for its overall repeal for those who commit violent felonies (including sex crimes) and domestic violence offenses.\"\" He repeated much of that accusation in a subsequent appearance on WPRO 630-AM's \"\"John DePetro Show.\"\" The good behavior statute he's talking about is part of a state law that dictates when and how prison inmates are allowed to earn time off their sentences. He is referring to a change in that policy enacted by lawmakers in 2008. But let's go back to what the law said before that rewrite. Since 1976, the statute has allowed well-behaved prison inmates -- except those serving life sentences -- to trim up to 10 days a month off their prison stays under a formula that was tied to the length of their sentence. For example, an inmate sentenced to eight\u00a0 years could knock eight days per month off his or her prison time, while someone serving five years could earn up to five days off a month. Prisoners could also earn small amounts of additional time off for what is known as meritorious service. Sex offenders were not excluded from those guidelines. Nor were violent felons or anyone else besides those with life sentences. In 2008, faced with cost concerns, crowding and calls for a good conduct policy that would allow those serving short sentences to earn as much time off as those imprisoned for more serious crimes, the state convened a panel to revamp the policy. That group was made up of prosecutors, public defenders, state police, the chief judge of the Superior Court, corrections officials and legislators. The result was a line item in Governor Carcieri's midyear budget that would have allowed all inmates except those serving life sentences to earn up to 10 days per month off their time -- a full third -- regardless of their crimes. The proposal also allowed inmates to earn up to five days more per month off for participating in rehabilitation programs such as substance-abuse treatment and anger management. House leaders later decided to consider the measure as a separate bill, rather than a budget item. (It is worth noting that as the House whip, Kilmartin was a member of that leadership team.) But as that bill made its way to the House floor, a small group of legislators on both sides of the aisle roared in protest. The new rules, they said, did not specifically exclude sex offenders, meaning they too were eligible for the increased good behavior benefits. House lawmakers rewrote the bill to specifically exclude sex offenders from benefiting from the new policy. In other words, they were still governed by the less generous statute from the 1970s. The legislation passed March 27, 2008, with Kilmartin voting yes. For procedural reasons, it found its way back into the midyear budget bill. It passed, complete with the language excluding sex offenders, in May of that year. Kilmartin again voted yes. But neither of his two votes that year gave any new privileges to sex offenders, as Wallin suggests. In fact, they did exactly the opposite, targeting sex offenders as the only inmates -- along with\u00a0 those serving life sentences -- who could not benefit. \"\"Basically every other inmate at the [Adult Correctional Institutions] got a real benefit from this change, and the sex offenders did not,\"\" said Patricia Coyne-Fague, chief legal council for the state Department of Corrections.

Initially, sex offenders, like other inmates, were able to earn time off for good behavior under the pre-existing statute from 1976. However, the 2008 legislation, which Kilmartin supported, revised this policy to exclude sex offenders from the new, more beneficial terms. Thus, Kilmartin's votes were directly aimed at preventing sex offenders from gaining additional good behavior credits, directly contradicting Wallin's claim.

The story centered around a South African couple, who had taken in 143 people following a wave of xenophobic attacks which\u00a0swept\u00a0the country in\u00a0April 2015. A white bleeding-heart leftist couple made headlines when they generously opened their home to a group of Muslim refugees allegedly fleeing devout Muslim militants.

In July, the headline read \u201cMeet the angels who opened their hearts and home to 143 lost strangers,\u201d and the left was drooling over the couple who followed their socialist values to the letter.

After escaping Islamic brutality in the Central African Republic, the Muslim migrants traveled to South Africa, where they were again set upon by South African natives in black-on-black attacks. So, the good-natured yet naive white couple welcomed the refugee families to their land, which included Obama\u2019s favored \u201cwidows and orphans.\u201d However, after only a few months of graciously allowing the Muslim migrants to live for free on their property, the loving couple soon found that they would actually be the refugees. The Wartnabys were threatened with slaughter by the same people they were helping escape brutality. While Mad World News\u00a0repeatedly states that the incident involved \u201cMuslim refugees,\u201d less sensationalized reports from local sources such as\u00a0News 24 \u00a0and\u00a0eNCA\u00a0made no mention of the group\u2019s religions, referring to them instead as \u201cforeign nationals\u201d \u2014 among the many who had initially fled other parts of Africa because of political persecution and extreme poverty.

The\u00a0Mad World News\u00a0article also cherry-picked and exaggerated facts in order to chastise this \u201cbleeding heart liberal\u201d couple for taking in refugees.

Fifty Five members accepted the terms, but the remaining 85 refused saying they wanted to be moved as a group. Since then, tensions between the two sides have risen. Wartnaby claims that on Tuesday the opposing group refused any food or water that was provided and the next morning, he had to call police to disperse the group which was protesting outside his home. Later that day, the electric fence around his property was cut and Wartnaby later discovered that the main tent had been torched.

{"claim_id":"11181","hypothesis":"Higher dietary fiber intake in young women may reduce breast cancer risk","explanation_1":"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will lead a push by the United Nations to make the finance sector take proper account of the risks posed by climate change, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday.","premise":"Guterres said the Canadian, due to leave the bank on Jan. 31, was \u201ca remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to work on climate\u201d. He told a news conference before a U.N. climate summit in Madrid beginning on Monday that Carney would be the U.N. special envoy on climate action and climate finance from next year. Michael Bloomberg, billionaire owner of the Bloomberg financial data and news service and former New York City mayor, was the U.N. special envoy for climate action until he stepped down in November, shortly before filing paperwork to run for U.S. president. Carney first spoke of the risks that climate change poses to finance in 2015, and since then has urged better risk management, supervision and disclosure. He has spoken of \u201cstranded assets\u201d - deposits of coal, oil and gas that might lose their value if the world shifts away from carbon - and decried a lack of transparency about the effect on global warming of trillions of dollars of potential investments. The 54-year-old has spent nearly seven years at the head of the bank, and previously led the Bank of Canada and worked for Goldman Sachs. The Bank of England said Carney would seek to make the impact of climate change central to financial reporting, risk management and the calculation of returns ahead of a global summit in Glasgow in November 2020. \u201cThe disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream,\u201d Carney said in a statement. Some 70 countries have promised to go \u2018net zero\u2019 - offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions with measures such as carbon capture or planting trees - by 2050. Last week, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said addressing climate change was a job for governments. But the new head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has promised to discuss sustainability considerations in an impending strategic review. The Band of England said Carney would earn $1 a year in his new role, nearly 900,000 pounds ($1.15 million) less than his annual package at the British central bank. Carney was originally due to leave in 2018 but stayed on to help steer Britain\u2019s economy through the Brexit transition.

He told a news conference before a U.N. climate summit in Madrid beginning on Monday that Carney would be the U.N. special envoy on climate action and climate finance from next year. Michael Bloomberg, billionaire owner of the Bloomberg financial data and news service and former New York City mayor, was the U.N. special envoy for climate action until he stepped down in November, shortly before filing paperwork to run for U.S. president. Carney first spoke of the risks that climate change poses to finance in 2015, and since then has urged better risk management, supervision and disclosure. He has spoken of \u201cstranded assets\u201d - deposits of coal, oil and gas that might lose their value if the world shifts away from carbon - and decried a lack of transparency about the effect on global warming of trillions of dollars of potential investments. The 54-year-old has spent nearly seven years at the head of the bank, and previously led the Bank of Canada and worked for Goldman Sachs. The Bank of England said Carney would seek to make the impact of climate change central to financial reporting, risk management and the calculation of returns ahead of a global summit in Glasgow in November 2020. \u201cThe disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream,\u201d Carney said in a statement. Some 70 countries have promised to go \u2018net zero\u2019 - offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions with measures such as carbon capture or planting trees - by 2050.

Young breast cancer survivors can be devastated by the possibility that treating their cancer may leave them unable to bear children.

Scott Walker\u2019s support of concealed carry gave his critics, some of whom want to recall him from office in 2012, another reason to slam him. On Oct. 30, 2011, two days before the concealed carrying of guns and other weapons became legal in Wisconsin, one visitor to a Facebook site that bashes Walker took a shot at the Republican governor and the law. She posted this statement from the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort Educational Fund:  \"\"People are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms than in those that prohibit it.\"\" Concealed carry has drawn high interest from gun owners -- more than 80,000 application forms for permits were downloaded by 9 a.m. on the first day the law took effect -- and from people who fear more gun carrying will lead to more violence. So we decided to check WAVE\u2019s statement. In becoming the 49th state to legalize concealed carry, Wisconsin generally allows people age 21 and over to carry hidden handguns, stun guns, most knives and other weapons. But there are restrictions, including some that apply to workplaces. Owners and occupants of property can prohibit concealed carry on or in the property. And employers can prohibit employees from carrying concealed weapons while on the job. WAVE, which describes itself as the \"\"only statewide grassroots organization solely dedicated to reducing gun violence, injuries and deaths,\"\" has been pushing businesses to post signs prohibiting concealed carry on their premises. It has made the claim that people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms to tens of thousands of people through its website, emails and direct mail, said executive director Jeri Bonavia. The claim, she said, is based on a May 2005 article in the American Journal of Public Health, which publishes peer-reviewed scientific research. The article was written by researchers from the University of North Carolina\u2019s Department of Epidemiology and Injury Prevention Research Center. We also found an earlier article on the same study, which appeared in another research publication, the American Journal of Epidemiology. The researchers examined 152 homicides that occurred in 143 workplaces in North Carolina from January 1994 through March 1998.

In contrast, WAVE said people are five to seven times more likely to be murdered in workplaces that allow firearms. We asked Stephen Marshall, one of the researchers, whether WAVE\u2019s wording was an accurate expression of what his study found; he simply reiterated the phrasing used in the study. We put the same question to other researchers; some said they thought WAVE\u2019s statement was an essentially accurate expression of what the study found, while others thought WAVE\u2019s wording was problematic.

Marshall said one could not assume that the five-to-seven-times statistic from his study would be true for Wisconsin or any other place. Other experts, however, gave a range of answers on whether the finding of the North Carolina study is applicable to Wisconsin workplaces. Applicability unknown: Susan Gerberich, co-director of the Regional Injury Prevention Center at the University of Minnesota, said that because the study was limited to North Carolina, it is not known whether the increased risk of workplace homicide would be true in other places.

Record crossings Tens of thousands of people, including children mostly from Central American countries, have been crossing the border, resulting in a record number of non-Mexicans getting apprehended. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Survey says... And what was Cruz citing? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out June 2014 news stories in The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner summarizing a Border Patrol survey reportedly brought to light in an undated document Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed into the records of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a June 2014 hearing. A copy of Grassley\u2019s document, emailed to us by Texas Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s office, describes May 2014 interviews of adults and children by Border Patrol officers in the agency\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector. By telephone, Grassley spokeswoman Beth Pellett Levine said the senator knows a whistleblower summarized the interviews, though she said that as of June 24, 2014, Homeland Security hadn\u2019t confirmed or denied the document\u2019s authenticity. By email, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, declined to comment on the four-page document. According to the document, the agents interviewed 230 adults and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala on May 28, 2014. The focus, the document says, was to \"\"obtain a general consensus as to why\"\" the border crossers \"\"are migrating en masse\"\" into the country through the Rio Grande Valley.

Also, the document says in many cases, \"\"the subjects mentioned more than one reason,\"\" including gang-related violence, extreme poverty, high unemployment, poor living conditions and subpar educational circumstances -- with many women mentioning domestic abuse. Still, the document says, the main reason interviewed individuals \"\"chose this particular time to migrate\"\" was to \"\"take advantage of the \u2018new\u2019 U.S. \u2018law\u2019 that grants a \u2018free pass\u2019 or permit (referred to as \u2018permisos\u2019) being issued by the U.S. government to female adult\"\" non-Mexicans \"\"traveling with minors and to\"\" unaccompanied children.\"\" The document says the issue of \"\"permisos\"\" was the \"\"main reason provided by 95% (+\/-) of the interviewed subjects.\"\" The document doesn\u2019t confirm any new law and we\u2019re unaware of any.

But that\u2019s not \"\"amnesty,\"\" as in an absolution enabling people to stay indefinitely without risk of penalty, and indeed \"\"amnesty\"\" goes unmentioned in the survey summary. Also, as unsaid by Cruz, the immigrants listed other reasons for coming, including crime and violence in home countries. The document, with its anonymous origins, doesn\u2019t specify how many individuals singled out these other factors. Another study, in which the United Nations earlier surveyed twice as many immigrants, pointed to gang violence as the vital factor. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\"\", and claim \"\"Ted Cruz Says 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said in a survey \"\"we are coming because we\u2019ve been promised amnesty.\"\". Please explain why the claim is Partially true and false.","explanation_llama":"The claim is partially true because Ted Cruz did quote a statistic from a survey, which states that 95% of people caught crossing the border said they were coming because of promises of permisos. However, the claim is also partially false because the survey did not mention amnesty, and the permisos referred to in the survey are actually notices to appear in immigration court, not a guarantee of staying in the country indefinitely. Additionally, the survey participants also mentioned other reasons for coming, including gang violence and poverty.","explanation_gpt35":"The claim that \"95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said in a survey 'we are coming because we\u2019ve been promised amnesty'\" is partially true and false. While it accurately reflects a statistic in a Border Patrol document stating that 95% of individuals cited the issuance of \"permisos\" as a main reason for crossing, the term \"permisos\" does not equate to \"amnesty\" as it refers to notices to appear in immigration court, not absolution from deportation or penalties. Additionally, the document also shows that immigrants cited other reasons for coming, such as violence and poverty in their home countries.","explanation_gpt4":"Ted Cruz's claim that \"95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said in a survey 'we are coming because we\u2019ve been promised amnesty'\" is partially true but also misleading. It is true that a document made public by Senator Chuck Grassley cites that 95 percent of interviewed border crossers indicated the U.S. government issuing \"permisos\" as a main reason for their journey. \"Permisos\" here refers to notices to appear in immigration court, which allow recipients to stay in the U.S. temporarily until their hearing.\n\nHowever, the claim is misleading because the term \"amnesty\" suggests a permanent legal status or forgiveness of violations, which is not what \"permisos\" grant. Furthermore, Cruz's statement omits that those interviewed also cited other significant reasons for migration, such as violence and economic hardship in their home countries. Thus, while the statistic about \"permisos\" is accurate, the context and interpretation of \"amnesty\" make the claim partially"}

Under Obamacare, states are being encouraged to expand Medicaid, the government-run healthcare program for the poor and disabled. In return, Washington is offering to pay all the new costs at first, and 90 percent of the new tab in 2020 and thereafter. Expansion in Virginia, which is strongly opposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, would open Medicaid to an estimated 400,000 people. Across the nation, about 16 million would become eligible for Medicaid if every state accepted the Obamacare offer. Almost all of these people are now uninsured -- making too little money to afford private health insurance but earning above the poverty levels that qualify for Medicaid. The U.Va. study is being cited by several conservatives -- including former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- as an argument against expansion. They say the study offers evidence that spreading Medicaid will spread bad health care results. Fact-checking Snyder\u2019s statement requires two determinations: 1) Did the U.Va. study actually find that Medicaid recipients face a greater risk of surgery-related death than uninsured people and all other categories of patients and, if so; 2) Was the heightened risk caused by Medicaid? The U.Va. study, published in 2010, considered how surgical patients fared during their hospitalization based on whether they had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or were uninsured. The researchers looked at almost 900,000 major operations across the country and adjusted for many population and health care variables, including age, income, region, type of hospital, type of operation and other health factors. \"\"Even after adjusting for all those things, the payer was still a predictor of poorer outcomes,\"\" Dr. Gorav Ailawadi, one of the authors of the paper, told us. The patients covered by Medicaid had the highest risk. They were 1.97 times more likely to die in the hospital than those with private insurance. Compared to the privately insured, Medicare recipients were 1.54 times more likely to die in the hospital and uninsured patients were 1.74 times more likely. With adjustments, Medicaid patients also had the longest hospital stays and greatest total costs. So Snyder is correct -- those covered by Medicaid did have an increased risk of mortality during their hospital stays. And he\u2019s right that Medicaid recipients were 13 percent more likely to die in the hospital during or after surgery than uninsured patients. But researchers place little of the blame on Medicaid. They noted that Medicaid recipients are the poorest, sickest and least educated group of patients. They are the least likely group to seek preventive health care. As a result, they are more likely to enter hospitals in dire conditions that require emergency surgery. \"\"Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders and psychoses,\"\" the study said. \"\"Furthermore, Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of metastatic cancer.\"\" The researchers said that uninsured patients have similar characteristics to Medicaid recipients and that it is \"\"plausible\"\" that both groups may suffer from a \"\"system bias\"\" that limits their access to private hospitals and top physicians. \"\"For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease,\"\" the study said. \"\"Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons.\"\" Does the research prove, as Snyder and other conservatives suggest, that it\u2019s safer to be uninsured than on Medicaid?

{"claim_id":"28492","hypothesis":"We fact-check a series of claims about the damage caused by Colorado's legalization of recreational cannabis.","explanation_1":"Interestingly, the rate of teen usage has gone down in Colorado since 2012-2013, when recreational use was legalized in the state. Then,11.16 percent of 12-17 year-olds said they had tried marijuana that month, and\u00a018.76 percent that year.","premise":"When Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 on Election Day 2012, the state joined Washington in becoming one of the first in the country to legalize the personal, recreational use of cannabis. Since then, observers and activists on every side of the wider drug-legalization debate have closely monitored the effects and consequences of Colorado and Washington\u2019s choice. Opponents to legalization alleged an increase in crime, traffic accidents, and other problems ahead of the vote. To mark the fifth anniversary of Amendment 64 in November 2017, the Colorado Springs Gazette published an editorial highlighting what it claimed was the \u201cembarrassing cautionary tale\u201d of the policy: an increase in homelessness, a doubling of fatal traffic collisions involving weed-intoxicated drivers, and a rise in drug violations in Colorado\u2019s schools. The article was later republished by the Oklahoman newspaper, and we received enquiries from readers about the accuracy of its claims. Homelessness \u201cFive years of retail pot,\u201d the editorial claimed, \u201ccoincide with five years of a homelessness growth rate that ranks among the highest rates in the country.\u201d Directors of homeless shelters, and people who live on the streets, tell us homeless substance abusers migrate here for easy access to pot. The statistical element of this claim is somewhat complicated, but largely accurate. According to figures published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the number of people in homelessness in Colorado actually fell by 34.8 percent between January 2012 (before the law changed) and January 2017. That\u2019s the ninth biggest decrease in homelessness in the country during that period. However, if you measure from January 2013 (a month after personal cannabis use became legal) to January 2017, there was a 12.2 percent increase, the sixth-highest in-state increase in homelessness in the nation, but this is largely due to an unusually low base in 2013, caused by an extraordinary 42 percent decline between 2012 and 2013. On average, the number of homeless people in Colorado fell by six percent each year between 2012 and 2017, which gives Colorado the 17th-highest average annual rate of decline in homelessness during those six years. However, between January 2013 and January 2017, there was an average annual increase of 2.94 percent, among the 10 worst records in the country. From January 2014 (six months before retail sales of cannabis became legal) and January 2017, there was a 9.1 percent increase in homelessness in Colorado, the seventh-highest increase in the nation during that period. And the average annual increase in those three years was 2.98 percent, also among the 10 highest annual increases in the country. The statistics present a mixed picture but generally give support to the claim that homelessness has increased in Colorado since the legalization of cannabis, and that this increase has been among the highest seen nationwide. However, there is significant doubt over whether the legalization of cannabis caused or contributed to that increase in homelessness. Statistics can rise simultaneously without being linked. Cathy Alderman, Vice President of Communications at the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, rejects the notion of a causal connection. Speaking by phone, she told us \u201cthere\u2019s no actual data that shows that.\u201d We don\u2019t necessarily believe that people are moving to Colorado, becoming homeless because of legalized marijuana\u2026We know that, among the people experiencing homelessness, marijuana use is more visible because, unlike people who can go to the dispensary, buy their product, take it home and use it, these people don\u2019t have a home to take it to\u2026but we haven\u2019t really heard that because of marijuana, people are becoming homeless. Alderman says there \u201cabsolutely\u201d has been an increase in homelessness in the state since 2012\/2013, and that Housing and Urban Development statistics are known to be underestimations. However, she told us the main causes of the increase (among which she does not count marijuana legalization) include: A lack of affordable housing options, increasing rent\u2026and the fact that wages are not keeping up with the cost of living and inflation. Fatal traffic collisions The op-ed claims: Five years of Big Marijuana ushered in a doubling in the number of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana, based on research by the pro-legalization Denver Post. This claim appears to be taken from an August 2017 report by the Denver Post, which read: The number of drivers involved in fatal crashes in Colorado who tested positive for marijuana has risen sharply each year since 2013, more than doubling in that time, federal and state data show. The article pointed to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics which show that the number of drivers in fatal accidents who tested positive for marijuana had risen by 145 percent between 2013 and 2016. Similarly, the percentage of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana grew, from 10 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2016, the article said. However, the Denver Post report highlights one important disclaimer. THC (the key component of cannabis) can stay in a person\u2019s bloodstream for weeks after usage, meaning a positive test does not mean a driver was impaired at the time of a fatal accident, or that cannabis use caused the collision. In general, marijuana use has significantly increased in Colorado since its legalization. According to figures from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, adults in the state who had consumed marijuana in the month before being surveyed went from being 12.86 percent of the adult population in 2012\/13 to 16.62 percent in 2015\/16. That\u2019s a rise of 29 percent, as compared to the 100 percent increase in the percentage of drivers in fatal accidents testing positive for cannabis (up from 10 percent to 20 percent.) This suggests that the general increase in cannabis consumption in Colorado could account for some of that rise in positive marijuana testing\u2014but it remains a suggestion, without more effective testing for pot intoxication. Increase in school drug violations The op-ed reads: Five years of commercial pot have been five years of more marijuana in schools than teachers and administrators ever feared. As evidence for this, the Gazette points to what it calls a \u201clate 2016\u201d\u00a0report by the Rocky Mountain affiliate of PBS. That report\u00a0vaguely refers to \u201cthe past four years\u201d as a period in which \u201cthe number of drug violations reported by Colorado\u2019s K-12 schools have [sic] increased 45 percent.\u201d According to the Gazette, the PBS investigation also discovered \u201can increase in high school drug violations of 71 percent since legalization.\u201d This summary of the Rocky Mountain PBS report is extremely misleading. While the online version of the report was updated in October 2016, it was originally published in February 2012. The \u201cfour years\u201d in question were from 2007-08 to 2010-11. In other words, the increase in school drug violations and drug-related suspensions which the Gazette blamed on the legalization of recreational cannabis happened 18 months before recreational cannabis was legalized. Medical marijuana has been legal in Colorado since 2000. What\u2019s more, the 2012 PBS report stipulated that the 71 percent rise in high school drug violations was specific to the city of Denver, a detail that the Gazette editorial left out. And as the 2012 report pointed out, the 45 percent increase in drug violations at K-12 schools was not specific to marijuana, although the report\u2019s authors added that \u201cinterviews with school and district officials, health care workers and students across Colorado depict marijuana as the overwhelming cause of the increase.\u201d Colorado authorities only began separating out marijuana-related incidents from incidents involving other drugs in 2015-16. That year, there were 3,704 marijuana violations and 2,047 violations involving other drugs. The Gazette editorial also falsely claimed that Colorado\u2019s teenagers had the highest rate of cannabis use in the country: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found Colorado ranks first in the country for marijuana use among teens, scoring well above the national average. In 2015-16, some 9.08 percent of 12-17 year-olds in Colorado said they had used marijuana in the month before they took the survey. That\u2019s the seventh-highest (not the highest) rate of monthly use in the country. When it comes to using marijuana in the year before the survey, Colorado\u2019s teens have the sixth-highest rate in the nation, with\u00a016.21 percent saying they had dabbled in the preceding 12 months.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":7576,"input_string":"Given the evidence \"When Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 on Election Day 2012, the state joined Washington in becoming one of the first in the country to legalize the personal, recreational use of cannabis. Since then, observers and activists on every side of the wider drug-legalization debate have closely monitored the effects and consequences of Colorado and Washington\u2019s choice. Opponents to legalization alleged an increase in crime, traffic accidents, and other problems ahead of the vote. To mark the fifth anniversary of Amendment 64 in November 2017, the Colorado Springs Gazette published an editorial highlighting what it claimed was the \u201cembarrassing cautionary tale\u201d of the policy: an increase in homelessness, a doubling of fatal traffic collisions involving weed-intoxicated drivers, and a rise in drug violations in Colorado\u2019s schools. The article was later republished by the Oklahoman newspaper, and we received enquiries from readers about the accuracy of its claims. Homelessness \u201cFive years of retail pot,\u201d the editorial claimed, \u201ccoincide with five years of a homelessness growth rate that ranks among the highest rates in the country.\u201d Directors of homeless shelters, and people who live on the streets, tell us homeless substance abusers migrate here for easy access to pot. The statistical element of this claim is somewhat complicated, but largely accurate. According to figures published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the number of people in homelessness in Colorado actually fell by 34.8 percent between January 2012 (before the law changed) and January 2017. That\u2019s the ninth biggest decrease in homelessness in the country during that period. However, if you measure from January 2013 (a month after personal cannabis use became legal) to January 2017, there was a 12.2 percent increase, the sixth-highest in-state increase in homelessness in the nation, but this is largely due to an unusually low base in 2013, caused by an extraordinary 42 percent decline between 2012 and 2013. On average, the number of homeless people in Colorado fell by six percent each year between 2012 and 2017, which gives Colorado the 17th-highest average annual rate of decline in homelessness during those six years. However, between January 2013 and January 2017, there was an average annual increase of 2.94 percent, among the 10 worst records in the country. From January 2014 (six months before retail sales of cannabis became legal) and January 2017, there was a 9.1 percent increase in homelessness in Colorado, the seventh-highest increase in the nation during that period. And the average annual increase in those three years was 2.98 percent, also among the 10 highest annual increases in the country. The statistics present a mixed picture but generally give support to the claim that homelessness has increased in Colorado since the legalization of cannabis, and that this increase has been among the highest seen nationwide. However, there is significant doubt over whether the legalization of cannabis caused or contributed to that increase in homelessness. Statistics can rise simultaneously without being linked. Cathy Alderman, Vice President of Communications at the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, rejects the notion of a causal connection. Speaking by phone, she told us \u201cthere\u2019s no actual data that shows that.\u201d We don\u2019t necessarily believe that people are moving to Colorado, becoming homeless because of legalized marijuana\u2026We know that, among the people experiencing homelessness, marijuana use is more visible because, unlike people who can go to the dispensary, buy their product, take it home and use it, these people don\u2019t have a home to take it to\u2026but we haven\u2019t really heard that because of marijuana, people are becoming homeless. Alderman says there \u201cabsolutely\u201d has been an increase in homelessness in the state since 2012\/2013, and that Housing and Urban Development statistics are known to be underestimations. However, she told us the main causes of the increase (among which she does not count marijuana legalization) include: A lack of affordable housing options, increasing rent\u2026and the fact that wages are not keeping up with the cost of living and inflation. Fatal traffic collisions The op-ed claims: Five years of Big Marijuana ushered in a doubling in the number of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana, based on research by the pro-legalization Denver Post. This claim appears to be taken from an August 2017 report by the Denver Post, which read: The number of drivers involved in fatal crashes in Colorado who tested positive for marijuana has risen sharply each year since 2013, more than doubling in that time, federal and state data show. The article pointed to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics which show that the number of drivers in fatal accidents who tested positive for marijuana had risen by 145 percent between 2013 and 2016. Similarly, the percentage of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana grew, from 10 percent in 2013 to 20 percent in 2016, the article said. However, the Denver Post report highlights one important disclaimer. THC (the key component of cannabis) can stay in a person\u2019s bloodstream for weeks after usage, meaning a positive test does not mean a driver was impaired at the time of a fatal accident, or that cannabis use caused the collision. In general, marijuana use has significantly increased in Colorado since its legalization. According to figures from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, adults in the state who had consumed marijuana in the month before being surveyed went from being 12.86 percent of the adult population in 2012\/13 to 16.62 percent in 2015\/16. That\u2019s a rise of 29 percent, as compared to the 100 percent increase in the percentage of drivers in fatal accidents testing positive for cannabis (up from 10 percent to 20 percent.) This suggests that the general increase in cannabis consumption in Colorado could account for some of that rise in positive marijuana testing\u2014but it remains a suggestion, without more effective testing for pot intoxication. Increase in school drug violations The op-ed reads: Five years of commercial pot have been five years of more marijuana in schools than teachers and administrators ever feared. As evidence for this, the Gazette points to what it calls a \u201clate 2016\u201d\u00a0report by the Rocky Mountain affiliate of PBS. That report\u00a0vaguely refers to \u201cthe past four years\u201d as a period in which \u201cthe number of drug violations reported by Colorado\u2019s K-12 schools have [sic] increased 45 percent.\u201d According to the Gazette, the PBS investigation also discovered \u201can increase in high school drug violations of 71 percent since legalization.\u201d This summary of the Rocky Mountain PBS report is extremely misleading. While the online version of the report was updated in October 2016, it was originally published in February 2012. The \u201cfour years\u201d in question were from 2007-08 to 2010-11. In other words, the increase in school drug violations and drug-related suspensions which the Gazette blamed on the legalization of recreational cannabis happened 18 months before recreational cannabis was legalized. Medical marijuana has been legal in Colorado since 2000. What\u2019s more, the 2012 PBS report stipulated that the 71 percent rise in high school drug violations was specific to the city of Denver, a detail that the Gazette editorial left out. And as the 2012 report pointed out, the 45 percent increase in drug violations at K-12 schools was not specific to marijuana, although the report\u2019s authors added that \u201cinterviews with school and district officials, health care workers and students across Colorado depict marijuana as the overwhelming cause of the increase.\u201d Colorado authorities only began separating out marijuana-related incidents from incidents involving other drugs in 2015-16.

A healthy diet and breast cancer risk reduction are worthy topics, but the story doesn\u2019t touch on some important points \u2014 such as the fact that a previous study in Pediatrics by the same researchers, using the same cohort data, pointed to adolescent dietary fiber intake as a significant factor in reducing breast cancer risk. We also were confused by the data discussion: What does a 25% reduction actually mean? Without absolute numbers, we\u2019re just not sure. As we noted in our story reviews related to the earlier Pediatrics study, the CDC reports that breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States \u2014 with more than 224,000 new cases reported in 2012 alone. Research findings that identify new ways to reduce the incidence of breast cancer are newsworthy, particularly when the new health measures may also have significant ancillary health benefits \u2014 as is likely the case with consuming a diet high in fruits.","premise":"Cost was not discussed, and because this is about fruit, we\u2019ll rate this N\/A.

No approach is likely to satisfy critics at both ends of the political spectrum.","premise":"In May 2018, a photograph of two children sleeping inside a fenced enclosure was widely circulated via social media with accompanying text stating that it pictured a \u201ckids\u2019 concentration camp\u201d in the U.S.:  This photograph dates from 2014 (during the Obama administration) and was not directly related to a mid-2018 controversy over Trump administration policy of separating children from undocumented migrant parents at the U.S. border. The picture was one of several that accompanied an Arizona Republic article about a detention center for undocumented migrant children in Nogales, Arizona. What this photograph depicts is not a \u201cconcentration camp\u201d as the term is most commonly used (i.e., a facility where \u201cpolitical prisoners or members of persecuted minorities are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution\u201d) but rather a temporary holding facility\/processing center for undocumented children who were apprehended entering the U.S. by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) during the height of an unprecedented surge of child migration from Central America that took place in 2014:  They are undocumented. They entered the country illegally. And when they were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they were shipped to Nogales from overwhelmed processing facilities in Texas. But they are still children in cages, not gangsters, not delinquents. Just children, 900 of them, in a makeshift border-town processing center that is larger than a football field. They pass the day sitting on benches or lying side by side on tiny blue mattresses pressed up against each other on nearly every square inch of the floor in the fenced areas.

They entered the country illegally. And when they were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, they were shipped to Nogales from overwhelmed processing facilities in Texas. But they are still children in cages, not gangsters, not delinquents. Just children, 900 of them, in a makeshift border-town processing center that is larger than a football field.

The photograph actually shows a temporary holding facility for undocumented migrant children in Nogales, Arizona, which was used during an unprecedented surge of child migration from Central America in 2014. While the conditions were indeed difficult, the facility was not a concentration camp in the classical sense, as it was not a facility where children were deliberately imprisoned for political or racial reasons. The facility was a temporary holding center where children were held until they could be placed with relatives or other caretakers pending adjudication of their cases.","explanation_gpt35":"The claim that the photograph shows a \"kids' concentration camp\" in the U.S. is partially true and false.

The children were treated humanely, provided with medical care, and were held until they could be placed with relatives or caretakers.","explanation_gpt4":"The claim that the photograph shows a \"kids' concentration camp\" in the U.S. is partially true in that it depicts a facility where children are held in conditions that could be seen as harsh and inadequate due to overcrowding and limited amenities. However, it is also false because the term \"concentration camp\" historically refers to places where political prisoners or persecuted minorities are deliberately imprisoned in extremely harsh conditions, often to provide forced labor or await mass execution. The facility in the photograph, a detention center for undocumented migrant children in Nogales, Arizona, does not fit this definition. It was intended as a temporary holding and processing center for children who entered the U.S. illegally, where they were to be provided with care and eventually placed with relatives or in suitable accommodations while awaiting immigration proceedings. The use of the term \"concentration camp\" is therefore misleading and not accurate for the context of this facility."}
{"claim_id":"9322","hypothesis":"3-Drug Therapy Might Be Cystic Fibrosis 'Breakthrough'","explanation_1":"This story reports on two trials that showed adding adding one of two new drugs to standard therapy possibly improved short-term lung function in cystic fibrosis patients who fall into two common categories of gene mutations. The story wisely included the high cost of some of these compounds, known as CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulators. However, the story did not give enough data to help readers make sense of the scope of the benefits. And while it did contain some caveats about the quality of evidence, those cautions were drowned out by numerous optimistic\u2013and speculative\u2013statements about how the drug will perform in future trials. Cystic fibrosis is genetic disease affecting about 80,000 people worldwide that leads to early death due to progressive lung disease. In recent years CFTR modulators have been developed to target the mutations themselves by correcting the malfunctioning CFTR protein, which regulates the flow of water and chloride in and out of cells lining the lungs and other organs. But there are many types of mutations that cause cystic fibrosis, and medications developed thus far have been effective only with certain ones. More widely effective CFTR modulators could greatly improve and dramatically extend the lives of people with cystic fibrosis. But that remains to be seen. As a result, journalists need to proceed very carefully in reporting about studies that test a small number of patients, measure a limited number of outcomes, and cover a short treatment period\u2013especially when these drugs cost could more than a quarter of a million dollars per year.","premise":"The story brought up the \u201creal-world issue of price\u201d if the drugs are approved. It reported that the company that makes them \u2014 Vertex Pharmaceuticals \u2014 markets the combination of two other CFTR modulators \u2014 tezacaftor and ivacaftor \u2014 for a list price of $292,000 a year. Additional cost comes from the continued need for hospitalization on a regular basis, at least for some patients. Treating these patients may well cost millions over the course of a decade.

What was the average starting number? And how did the control groups do in comparison? We\u2019re not told.

That should have been pointed out. The story reported: \u201cSo far, the treatments appear safe. Most side effects in the four-week trials were \u2018mild to moderate,\u2019 the researchers said, and included cough, headache and increased sputum.\u201d The story should also have said that three patients in the VX-445 trial discontinued treatment, due to severe adverse events including intestinal blockages intestines and temporary worsening of lung function.

On the plus side, it described the findings as \u201cpreliminary\u201d and the trial as \u201cshort-term,\u201d lasting four weeks. It mentioned outstanding questions such as whether the improved lung function can be sustained over longer periods, and whether the therapy can achieve other meaningful outcomes such as reducing episodes of diminished lung function or helping with weight gain. It also quoted researcher Steven Rowe, MD, saying these drugs are \u201cnot a cure\u201d and that important questions remain, including how well they work for younger patients. But those cautions might easily be overlooked due to the prominent hype.

{"claim_id":"11320","hypothesis":"Study says bypass surgery for heart patients better than stents in the long term","explanation_1":"\"There were enough problems with the execution of this story, which presents results of a study comparing open-heart surgery to angioplasty in patients with serious heart disease, that, in the end, one could question the decision to publish it. The story failed to evaluate the quality of the evidence and to emphasize factors which raise questions about that quality:    The results were reported at a medical meeting and have not been published or peer-reviewed. (See our primer on the potential pitfalls of reporting on such stories.) It was financed by a leading maker of stents. Patients were followed for only one year. The surgery-vs.-stent topic is highly controversial, even emotional, raising questions of benefits, risks, doctors\u2019 self-interest and medical costs \u2013 all against a background of contradictory research. Publishing an article on this topic for a mass audience without raising more questions about the quality of the evidence is not in the public interest. Having said all that, the reporter follows many health journalism best practices, including reporting absolute risks, quoting sources with no connection to the research, revealing the study\u2019s funding source and providing context about previous research into stents. Experience suggests that the decision to report a story like this can result when a reporter attends a medical conference and feels obligated to \"\"come back with something.\"\" This invites overselling of the story by the reporter or the editor. This tension may be apparent in the lede, which seeks to present a novel viewpoint on the findings. The reporter suggests the findings mean the choice to have surgery or angioplasty \"\"may come down to one question: How many procedures would you like to have?\"\" That\u2019s a spurious question. This research does nothing to change the established considerations that should drive a surgery-vs.-stent decision: Underlying patient health, disease state, death risk, stroke risk, recuperation time, access to a highly skilled surgeon and so on. To imply this potentially life-changing decision should rest on \"\"how many procedures\"\" you want to have is foolish.\"","premise":"\"The costs of open-heart-surgery and stenting should have been mentioned.

It also adequately describes the size, duration and methodology of the study. The study mentions the potential harms of surgery and stents, including death and need for additional procedures. But the story fails to distinguish in meaningful way between the 2 percent risk of stroke linked to surgery and the 8 percent greater chance of requiring a second procedure linked to stents compared to heart surgery. Stroke is a potentially debilitating, life-shortening condition; a second angioplasty presumably carries a very low risk of serious side effects. The story fails to mention the demonstrated risks of heart attack and cognitive dysfunction linked to the surgery option. Further, the story fails to indicate whether a \"\"second procedure\"\" means a heart surgery or a stent, and how that varies for each treatment group. Would someone with a stent require a heart operation as a second procedure, or another stent? That\u2019s a big difference. Without this information, it\u2019s impossible to compare the risks of the first procedures properly. The story is based on results of a study that were presented at a conference and sponsored by the maker of a stent. The results cover only one year. The research has not been peer reviewed. The results may be specific to the stent used in the procedures included in the study. The story never emphasized these factors to comment on the quality of the evidence.
