{"claim_id":"23027","hypothesis":"Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the United States.","explanation_1":"Hospital says Georgia's kids second-fattest in nation","premise":"\"The news was enough to make the AJC PolitiFact Georgia scribe toss her leftover Halloween candy corn to the squirrels. \"\"Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the United States,\"\" said a recent news release from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, a hospital that specializes in pediatric care. Second? Out of all the states in the union? Are Georgia kids really that hefty? Yes, we felt guilty. One PolitiFact Georgia reporter had spent a recent afternoon dressed as a witch, handing out fistfuls of sweets to trick-or-treaters. Childhood obesity can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol and other potentially deadly problems. It also places more burdens on the health care system. We called a spokeswoman for Children's Healthcare Atlanta, who pointed us to \"\"F as in Fat,\"\" a report issued by the Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit group that specializes in disease prevention. Sure enough, there Georgia was, second only to Mississippi in 2007 for obesity rates among 10- to 17-year-olds. In this state, 21.3 percent of children were obese, the report said. Mississippi's rate was 21.9 percent. The report defined an \"\"obese\"\" child as one with a body mass index greater than the 95th percentile for his age group. For instance, a 10-year-old boy with a height of 4 foot 6 inches and weighing 100 pounds would be obese. That's because his body mass index is 24.1, which is in the 97th percentile of his age group. Of the 10 states with the highest childhood obesity rates, nine were in the South, the report said. Children in Western states tended to be far more svelte. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest obesity rates were located in that region. The trust used figures from the National Survey of Children's Health, an effort funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The telephone survey asks parents for their children's ages, races, genders, weights and heights. Almost all the state-by-state rankings we found were based on data from that same survey. Understandably, they came up with similar results. The National Kids Count Program, run by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, used the same data to rank Georgia third in 2007. Its analysis ranked a slightly different group of kids: the number of children age 10-17 who are overweight as well as obese. Those are children whose body mass index is above the 85th percentile for their age and gender. A set of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided different results, but this survey was far from comparable. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System asks high school students in grades nine through 12 to report whether they are obese. The CDC does not rank states by high school obesity rates, but the data show that in 2009, 12.4 percent of Georgia high schoolers said they were obese. That's the 19th-highest of the states. But again, high schoolers report their own weight for this survey, and they might not be as accurate as their parents. The CDC does conduct a survey in which children are measured in person, but it doesn't break down the data by state. Why are Georgia's kids so heavy? We could locate no studies that answer that question, but there are some hints. The children who are at the highest risk for obesity are minorities or from rural areas, and they make up a large proportion of the state's child population, said Marsha Davis, a professor at the University of Georgia who studies childhood obesity. In rural areas, parents have trouble getting to supermarkets that sell fruits and vegetables. They end up feeding children with junk food they find at gas station convenience stores. For instance, the agricultural industry in South Georgia's Colquitt County ships produce across the country but sells very little locally, Davis said. The obesity rate there is extremely high. So while there is some variance in what surveys tell us, there's widespread agreement that Georgia kids are obese. And by one widely respected measure, Georgia's kids are the second-most obese in the nation. Now, that's not to say you need to throw out your kid's stash of Halloween candy. \"\"Halloween is fun,\"\" Davis said. \"\"The problem is we're having Halloween every day.\"\".\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":1208}
{"claim_id":"8051","hypothesis":"'Like wartime' - Philippine doctors overwhelmed by coronavirus deluge.","explanation_1":"Private hospitals in the Philippines capital Manila have stopped accepting coronavirus patients in the face of surging numbers of sufferers and people seeking tests, the hospitals said.","premise":"The Philippines has reported relatively fewer infections than many other countries in Southeast Asia, but medical experts say a lack of testing has meant that the scale of the epidemic has gone undetected. \u201cIt\u2019s like wartime,\u201d said Eugenio Ramos, a doctor and head of The Medical City, a Manila private hospital, which was among the first to turn away coronavirus patients. It has attended to more than 1,000 people who feared they had coronavirus and is currently treating more than 100 suspected coronavirus patients, 14 in intensive care. \u201cMore and more are coming, a lot of scared people, some of them already in their advanced stage,\u201d Ramos said this week - adding that facilities were so stretched that many who should be in the intensive care unit were just being intubated with breathing tubes to keep them alive. The scenes are akin to those in hospitals in countries that have been overwhelmed by coronavirus cases, but comes less than three weeks since the country of 107 million reported its first case of local transmission. The Philippines has reported 803 cases and 54 deaths. Malaysia, with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at 2,161, has had 26 deaths. The situation in the Philippines is similar to that in Indonesia, the region\u2019s most populous country, where there is an even higher ratio of deaths to detected cases - an indicator for doctors that the number of infections may be much higher. Former Health Minister Esperanza Cabral said the reported infection rate was probably just the tip of the iceberg, given the Philippines has so far only tested 2,147 people. \u201cWe cannot gauge the extent of the outbreak until we have tested about 10,000 to 20,000 people,\u201d Cabral told Reuters. Testing in the Philippines is to be ramped up with the arrival of 100,000 test kits from China. Modeling from the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford suggests the number of infections in the Philippines may already be higher than 11,000. The Philippines took drastic measures to contain the spread after its first domestic case on March 7, becoming the third country after China and Italy to put its people under home quarantine, suspend transport, work and commercial activity. But the health system is weak. The Philippines, which on average sends 19,000 trained nurses overseas each year, has 10 beds and 14 doctors per 10,000 people, according to data from the World Health Organization. Italy has more than 40 doctors and 30 beds per 10,000 people. An emergency ward worker who spoke to Reuters described patients waiting up to six hours to be seen and inexperienced staff treating critical patients due to manpower shortages. Nine medical workers have died, and hundreds more have been quarantined for being close to sufferers. The University of Santo Tomas hospital has 530 staff quarantined. The Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center said it had insufficient testing kits and protective gear and could not take more coronavirus patients. Under pressure from 11 private hospitals, the government has now dedicated three public hospitals to serve as special COVID-19 treatment centers - but they themselves are also under strain. \u201cWe have every reason to be scared,\u201d the private hospitals said in a letter appealing for help. The head of the emergency department of St. Luke\u2019s Medical Centre, Richard Enecilla, said it had received 120 possible coronavirus-related patients in one day, and made them line up on the hospital driveway to limit exposure. \u201cThe way it exploded caught a lot us off-guard,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThe volume of cases went up and our capacity to serve went down at the same time.\u201d","label":0,"__index_level_0__":1447}

{"claim_id":"38992","hypothesis":"\u00a0 A Germanwings airbus crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people was an act of terror because Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam before the crash. ","explanation_1":"Germanwings Pilot Had Converted to Islam-Investigation Pending!","premise":"There has been a lot of speculation about why Germanwings co-pilot Andrea Lubitz intentionally flew an airplane into a mountain, but there\u2019s no clear answer yet. The Germanwings airbus crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015. Two days later, Germanwings  said in a statement that the crash \u201cappeared\u201d to be a deliberate act by co-pilot Andrea Lubitz: \u201cWe are horrified to discover today that the aircraft that crashed in the south of France appears to\u00a0have been crashed deliberately \u2013 probably by the co-pilot of flight 4U9525. Based on audio taken\u00a0from the voice recorder, the French authorities have come to the conclusion that after the aircraft\u00a0had reached cruising altitude, the captain left the cockpit for a short time and was then unable to re-enter. It appears that the co-pilot, who had stayed in the cockpit, prevented the captain from re-entering by fully locking the cockpit door in order to then initiate the fatal descent. All Germanwings\u00a0and Lufthansa employees are deeply shocked. We could never have imagined that a tragedy like\u00a0this could occur within our company.\u201d It\u2019s not yet known why Andreas Lubitz would deliberately fly the plane into the side of a mountain. Early reports indicated that Lubitz had been treated for mental illness in the past and had previously attempted suicide. French authorities found a torn up sick note from a doctor that would have excused Andreas Lubitz from work on the day of the crash, but the reason for the note hasn\u2019t been revealed. Germanwings  said that Lubitz didn\u2019t submit the sick note to them. German officials said that Andreas Lubitz had hid \u201can unspecified medical condition\u201d from his employers, the Telegraph  reports: \u201cThe fact there are sick notes saying he was unable to work, among other things, that were found\u00a0torn up, which were recent and even from the day of the crime, support the assumption based on\u00a0the preliminary examination that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and his professional\u00a0colleagues. \u201cThe prosecutors said in a statement that the documents were found in searches of Lubitz\u2019s homes\u00a0in Duesseldorf and in the town of Montabaur in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. \u201cThe Uniklinik hospital in Dusseldorf confirmed that it had treated Lubitz in recent weeks but said it\u00a0was not for depression. \u201cMeanwhile Bild, the German newspaper, reported that \u2018Lubitz had a serious relationship crisis with\u00a0his girlfriend before the disaster and the resulting heartbreak is thought to have led to this.\u2019\u201d Just before the crash, Andreas Lubitz\u2019s pregnant girlfriend broke up with him. Her friends said Lubitz was a \u201ctormented and erratic man\u201d who suffered from unpredictable behavior and mood swings. He had also been having an affair with a Germanwings flight attendant in the months leading up to the crash, the Daily Mail  reports. Early indicators suggest that Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental illness and that led him to deliberately crash the airplane. Sill, other theories claim that it was an act of terrorism and that Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam. One of those  claims comes from the German blog site Pi-News: \u201cAll evidence\u00a0indicates that the copilot of Airbus\u00a0machine in his six-months break during his\u00a0training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and\u00a0subsequently either\u00a0by the order of \u2018radical,\u2019 ie. devout Muslim , or received the order\u00a0from the book of terror, the\u00a0Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this\u00a0mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of\u00a0the\u00a0investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that\u00a0he \u2014 as Mohammed Atta, in the\u00a0attack against New York \u2014 received his\u00a0instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque.\u201d That report has been repeated by a number of blog sites across the web. However, Pi-News isn\u2019t a trustworthy news source. The website  describes itself as against \u201cthe mainstream, America, Israel, basic and human laws and the fight against the Islamisation of Europe.\u201d Officials in France and Germany have not said that the crash could have been an act of terrorism, but the investigation is ongoing.

KOTV shared a statement from Glenpool schools confirming the incident occurred, but declined to provide details: Glenpool Public Schools is aware of a student fight which occurred on campus after the lunch period as students were transitioning back to class. The fight occurred at 11:25 approximately one and a half hour after a student led campus walk-out protesting school violence.

{"claim_id":"34581","hypothesis":"An 86-year-old woman's severely  painful and curved back was cured by her practicing yoga for a month.","explanation_1":"Without contacting her personal doctor or seeing her medical records, it\u2019s hard to verify exactly what helped her overcome her back problem. Yoga seems to have played a positive role in her life, regardless of whether it was the cure, but doctors caution that it isn\u2019t for everyone and urge potential yogis to seek out professional medical care\u00a0and good instructors to ensure safety.","premise":"An August 2016 New York Post article reporting that an elderly New York woman got complete relief from a curved and painful back by doing one month of yoga has gone viral. But a spine surgeon told us it\u2019s unlikely yoga alone miraculously cured her. The 8 August 2016 account stated that 86-year-old Anna Pesce, the \u201cyoga grandma,\u201d now stands tall despite suffering from a herniated disc, scoliosis, and osteoporosis, and the feel-good premise has become popular on Facebook, prompting other news outlets to cover the story. The Post article said Pesce had lived with a hunched-over posture for decades, and in 2014 she experienced debilitating pain trying to climb a set of stairs that left her wheelchair-bound \u2014 until she discovered yoga: [Yoga instructor Rachel] Jesien visited Pesce in her home once a week, teaching her restorative poses and stretches such as child\u2019s pose and chair savasana, in which Pesce would rest her lower legs on a chair while lying on the floor with her knees slightly bent and a strap around her thighs. After one month of sessions, Pesce was able to walk again. But Dr. Nick Shamie, a spine surgeon and professor of orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery at the University of California at Los Angeles, told us that while practicing yoga has likely been good for Pesce\u2019s overall health, he can\u2019t credit it with healing her back: The reason people\u00a0get excited about this story is someone who was in severe pain, with one month of treatment, has had a complete return to normalcy\u00a0with something that is safe and enjoyable. But we need to be objective of our statements. Acute pain from a back injury, depending on the source and severity, often goes away with no more help than the body\u2019s natural ability to heal over time. Dr. Shamie said he himself practices yoga but stressed that while he generally considers it beneficial, people with back pain need to see a medical doctor before jumping into an exercise regimen: One needs to objectively look at her symptoms and try and correlate the symptom with a diagnosis \u2014 when did her pain start versus what medical conditions are acute. Then you have to see if yoga is an appropriate treatment\u00a0for that diagnosis. If someone has a fracture of the spine, the last thing you want to do is go and do a down dog. It\u2019s\u00a0not uncommon for patients and their loved ones to\u00a0mistake whatever course of action they\u2019ve taken to relieve their symptoms\u00a0as a miracle cure when it coincides with relief (even though the relationship isn\u2019t necessarily a causal one): Yoga, regular exercise, appropriate diet, regular and ample hours of sleep all have a positive effect on your sense of well being. But to say someone was suffering from three conditions, not know which was symptomatic and saying after yoga all three of them got better, I think it\u2019s a stretch. Notwithstanding that, I believe that yoga is definitely a great form of exercise and can certainly, if done correctly, with proper guidance and training, help with pain that many people\u00a0are suffering from regarding the spine and may even increase the longevity of your spine. Like any other exercise regimen, if done inappropriately and with bad habits can actually be harmful. Dr. Jeffrey Wang, co-director of the Spine Center at the University of Southern California and professor of orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery, said yoga does help some of his patients \u2014 the regimen can help straighten out a hunched spine if the patient doesn\u2019t have a rigid deformity, which can only be corrected through surgery: There are people\u00a0that lean forward because their muscles are fatigued and tired. The bone isn\u2019t in that position, it\u2019s the muscles. If you strengthen the muscles you can get back your posture. The danger is that there are a lot of people\u00a0in her age group that have fixed deformities\u00a0that are not flexible. If so you can do all the exercises in the world and it\u2019s not going to give back your posture. He believes Pesce to have had a flexible deformity, which are caused by muscle weakness and not fixed skeletal issues. If that is the case, it is possible yoga could have helped her strengthen core muscles and straighten out her back: You have someone who has a flexible deformity that had weak muscles and\u00a0got into a good exercise program and I think that\u2019s fantastic. Pesce\u2019s yoga instructor, Rachel Jesien, pointed out that she and other teachers she works with have developed a special yoga program to help people with scoliosis and other back problems. She said Pesce\u2019s dedication and hard work were key to her recovery.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":8942}
{"claim_id":"34601","hypothesis":"Hanging plastic bags filled with water will repel flies.","explanation_1":"Will hanging plastic bags filled with water repel flies from your area? Opinion is divided on that technique's effectiveness.","premise":"In the same vein as the oft-asserted claim that leaving bottles of water on one\u2019s lawn will keep dogs from using that space as their personal lavatory is the belief that see-thru plastic bags filled with water and hung where flies can see them will keep those airborne pests at bay. Numerous folks swear by the practice, with restaurant operators from the Florida Keys to Texas numbering among that group. While the Internet-circulated how-to on repelling flies mandates the inclusion of four pennies in the bag, others who endorse the practice advocate placing only a single penny in each water-filled pouch, and others recommend using instead flakes of tin foil. However, the most common array of this sort is the unadorned bag of water, with such filled pouches to be either taped to one\u2019s doors or suspended in areas where flies are a particular problem. As to whether this method works, some swear by it, while others who have tried it assert that such preventives don\u2019t deter the flies one whit. Theories abound as to why such a practice might work. Some practitioners claim that flies perceive such bags as the surface of a large body of water and therefore avoid them. (This is a somewhat puzzling explanation, as flies are no strangers to ponds, puddles, lakes, and the like). Others maintain that the flies are scared off at seeing their own magnified reflections in the water bags. (Again, though, flies don\u2019t seem to shy away from other types of surfaces that reflect and\/or magnify their images.) The most common theory is that flies bases their sense of direction by where sunlight is coming from, and their complex eyes are overwhelmed and confused by the multi-directional refracted light produced by the bags, causing them to fly off rather than hang around. Science has yet to provide a definitive answer either way. In 2007, Mike Stringham, a North Carolina State University (NCSU) researcher, reported on his findings after spending 13 weeks studying the effects of water bags on flies at an egg-packing plant. After meticulously counting droppings left by flies on white \u201cspot cards,\u201d he concluded that the bags, rather than repelling the flying annoyances, actually attracted more of them. Said Stringham, \u201cIn the control room versus bags, the bags were consistently higher every time.\u201d  However, Stringham\u2019s study was conducted indoors under fluorescent and incandescent lighting, a factor which may limit its applicability: it\u2019s possible the effects of direct sunlight on the bags might produce a different result (as sunlight in outdoor environments varies and dances in ways that unwavering manmade sources of light do not). A December 2010 episode of Mythbusters found no significant difference between the number of flies attracted to a chamber holding both rotten meat and a plastic bag of water (without coins) and one which held only rotten meat. As with the NCSU experiment, however, the results might have been an artifact of the particular setup used rather than proof of a general truism. San Francisco Examiner columnist Richard Fagerlund (aka \u201cBugman\u201d) has tackled this question (in a decidedly unscientific way) several times over the course of years:  Q: At a Mississippi drive-in, I questioned the waitress about the bag of water over the door, thinking it might be a prank. I am 51 and had never come across this so I thought she was kidding when she told me it repelled flies. She was familiar with its use last summer and was convinced that it is a valid theory. I was motivated to look it up on the Internet. What can you tell me about it? A: This is a result of a column I wrote a number of years ago and is worth repeating. Fill a sandwich-size Ziploc bag about half full of water. Tape the top of the bag to the outside of your door. Replenish the water as needed. It is not clear why these water bags repel flies, but they do. I have gotten a ton of mail from all over the world when this column originally ran and the mail ran 9 to 1 saying this method worked. You may also get some questions from visitors as to why you have a Ziploc bag of water on your front door. Some possible answers are: It attracts flies. It scares flies. If it freezes, we know it\u2019s cold outside. If it boils, we know it is hot outside. I don\u2019t know, ask the Bug Man, it was his idea. When you drive around town, look for Ziploc bags on doors and you will know who reads this column. A possible explanation for the \u201cbags of water repel flies\u201d phenomenon is simple confirmation bias. When people put up bags of water and notice a decrease in the amount of flies hanging around (for reasons which are coincidental and have nothing to with any actual repellant qualities of the bags), they gleefully report far and wide that the method absolutely works. But when people try it and obtain no noticeable positive results, they tend to simply forget about it and move on without publicizing the outcome of their efforts.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":3818}

We\u2019ll start with the researcher whose work, indirectly, lies behind Baker\u2019s central argument. More than four decades ago, in a report for the congressional Joint Economic Committee, medical sociologist Harvey Brenner assessed the impact of sustained unemployment. Brenner found that in a five-year period, a 1.4% rise in unemployment added about 30,000 deaths due to suicides (1,540), homicides (1,740), liver disease (870) and cardiovascular\/kidney disease (26,440). Factoring in America\u2019s growing population, a recent opinion piece estimated the added deaths to be 58,000. That piece, citing Brenner, was the source of Baker\u2019s claim. But Brenner, now a professor at the University of North Texas, described how the video fundamentally misused his work. Brenner said his work is about \"\"the permanent loss of jobs,\"\" not an immediate rise in unemployment, no matter how dramatic. The deaths he identified started two years after a sustained economic downturn. \"\"It is not now statistically possible to render a verdict on the economy-based mortality implications of the immediate downturn of the past two months,\"\" Brenner said. \"\"Baker\u2019s video is not factually correct.\"\" Baker builds his entire case on Brenner\u2019s findings. But over the decades, other researchers have cast doubt on Brenner\u2019s core conclusion, some going so far as to say he got things upside down. There are deaths of despair, said Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They wrote a New York Times bestseller \"\"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism.\"\" The deaths primarily were among less educated white Americans and started in the 1990s. \"\"They rose before the Great Recession, they grew during the Great Recession and they grew after the Great Recession,\"\" Case and Deaton wrote in a recent op-ed. \"\"The line of rising deaths shows no perceptible effect of the collapse of the economy.\"\" Case and Deaton point to Spain and Greece as the poster children of the beneficial effects of recession. \"\"Unemployment in Greece and Spain more than tripled, to the point where more than a quarter of the population was unemployed,\"\" they wrote. \"\"Yet Greece and Spain saw increases in life expectancy that were among the best in Europe.\"\" As counterintuitive as it might sound, mortality from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. typically falls during a downturn, as Christopher Ruhm, a University of Virginia economist found. One study reported that in a lackluster economy, people exercise more and smoke less. That\u2019s particularly telling, since heart related deaths were a huge factor in Brenner\u2019s total. Ruhm cautions, though, that the tie between the economy and any given disease is complex and changeable. The reduction in heart disease deaths seen in decades past was not as strong in recent years and might give way further in the current crisis if fear of the virus keeps people from seeking treatment. Still, he called the statistics in Baker\u2019s video \"\"silly.\"\" Ruhm\u2019s overarching warning is that the country is in new territory. \"\"The fundamental fact is that we can\u2019t extrapolate from the recent past to understand the effects of the coronavirus,\"\" he said. \"\"The nature and magnitude of the effects are just too different from past experience.\"\" And as he and other researchers have noted, if the country hadn\u2019t moved to stop the spread of COVID-19, deaths would have mounted astronomically \u2014 which would have brought economic devastation in its own right. A TikTok user said it\u2019s the economic downturn, not the coronavirus, \"\"that\u2019s killing people.\"\" He brought up the statistic that a 1% rise in unemployment causes 58,000 additional deaths over five years, due to heart attacks, drug abuse and other \"\"diseases of despair.\"\" The researcher whose work lies behind that statistic said it doesn\u2019t apply and that he has no question that current deaths, now over 80,000, stem from the virus. No analyst said the immediate scale of deaths could be tied to rising unemployment.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":5450}

It would be easier to accept NASA\u2019s official explanation if they were not so secretive about everything they study and do in space \u2013 but one thing is for certain \u2013 NASA\u2019s own personnel have admitted that lithium, along with other chemicals, are intentionally being placed into our environment regularly. It is possible that many of NASA\u2019s own employees aren\u2019t even aware of the true motivations for carrying out such a project, ironically displaying the very behaviors that these chemicals\/pharmaceuticals are meant to instill. In the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ([redacted]@nasa.gov) admits that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere, and says that it is \u201charmless to the environment.\u201d NASA Confesses to Thoughts on this? \ud83d\udc49 Dosing Americans with Air-borne Lithium & Other Chemicals AnonHQ https:\/\/t.co\/zfElekED5a \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 19, 2016  The article then\u00a0launched into assigning of purported motives for dosing Americans with lithium, a potent anti-manic psychiatric\u00a0medication. From there, the article made its case for the existence of a NASA lithium spraying\u00a0program (without any citations,\u00a0and bearing a strong similarity to a\u00a0previous\u00a0hoax): It is very real, and there is ample scientific documentation to corroborate what I put forth here: A Pub Med abstract titled, Feasibility of Aerosol Vaccinations in Humans discusses how an increase in antigen volumes can be beneficial in aerosol delivery of vaccines, and could be used in \u201cdeveloping countries and disaster areas.\u201d The abstract also admits that several thousand human subjects have already been aerosol vaccinated with live attenuated measles and influenza A vaccines. The executive summary further states that aerosol vaccinations are ideal for \u201clarge populations.\u201d This has apparently been happening since as early as 2003. Another discussion of aerosolized vaccinations can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine. A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Aerosolized Vaccines Against Measles states that these vaccines were tested on children in India that were as young 9 months old. The World Health Organization has been researching aerosol vaccines for years now, as have \u201cphilanthropic\u201d agencies which have clear aims to sterilize the population. It is also worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry has been absolved from any legal responsibility for medicating the masses since they were awarded legal protection from all lawsuits by Congress in 1986. This law was challenged, but upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. Many powerful agencies are making sure that we \u201ctake our medicine.\u201d In fact, many nations are participating in our unwitting, forced vaccination, and the dumping of any number of attenuated viruses, chemical concoctions and other \u2018chemtrails\u2019 on our heads with dogged frequency. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) considered giving a license application to PaxVax Australia (PaxVax) for the intentional release of a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into the environment in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. They planned to release cholera on their people. According to the regulator, this GMO vaccine qualified as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000. Of course, we can\u2019t ignore the USA. Michael Greenwood wrote an article stating that: \u201cThe incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through large\u2013scale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes, according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health.\u201d Buried among the tinfoil were a few actual facts:\u00a0that 2003 study\u00a0does exist, but it studied aerosolized vaccines \u2014 i.e. ones that are inhaled as opposed to injected \u2014 and had nothing to do with dropping chemicals from planes. Another unrelated piece of \u201cproof\u201d offered up by the author was the widespread and well-documented efforts to combat the spread of West Nile virus by spraying\u00a0insecticide,\u00a0initiatives that targeted mosquitos, not humans. The excerpt also referenced \u201cGMO vaccines,\u201d a term we were unable to\u00a0even define (a\u00a01998 paper speculated on the promise\u00a0of \u201cgenetically engineered vaccines\u201d). Also included was a video titled \u201cNASA admits chemtrails,\u201d published to YouTube on 13 July 2013 (and purportedly recorded three days earlier):  The clip\u00a0(which had no video component, only audio) was purported to be\u00a0a recorded phone call between a woman identified only as \u201cSue\u201d and NASA astrophysicist\u00a0Douglas Rowland. \u201cSue\u201d brought up\u00a0a\u00a0video she watched in which lithium was mentioned, and the exchange that followed illustrated how the caller and the NASA scientist were carrying\u00a0on entirely separate conversations. Sue\u00a0fixated on the use of the word \u201clithium\u201d as Rowland tried\u00a0to explain NASA\u2019s study of the upper atmosphere, and why conditions\u00a0there differed from those\u00a0at lower altitudes: Sue: When the article came out in the major newspapers including The Huffington Post there was no mention of lithium, not one. Not one mention of lithium until I heard the recording of the actual \u2026 I \u2026 listened to the rockets go off. I had no idea there was going to be a lithium dispersed until I heard \u2018Payload \u2026 lithium \u2026 dispersed.\u2019\u201d Rowland: Right, there was lithium dispersed and I\u2019d be happy to talk about it. I think you may be under so misconceptions about what we\u2019re doing, but I\u2019m happy to tell you any details that you need. Sue: It says in your article that you\u2019re doing it for communications. Rowland: There are many reasons we\u2019re doing it because we don\u2019t understand how the wind in the upper atmosphere moves. Chemtrails \u2026 there are different kinds of chemtrails. Different trails at night. We use different trails during the day. The wind blows them around. They glow either on their own or from scattered sunlight. We take pictures and we can see how the wind trail moves around. It\u2019s just like if you were taking a picture of an airplane contrail. You could use that to see how the wind was blowing. This is much higher altitude so we use these chemical trails. Sue: What is the purpose of knowing what the wind\u2019s going to do in the ionosphere? Rowland: The purpose is really to understand our planet. It\u2019s very fundamental science. Every day we know there is electrical current that flow over the head that is naturally there. They have been there ever since the Earth had an atmosphere and electrical field. And the wind is driven by the sun. The sun heats the atmosphere, the wind blows and every day that wind drives an electric current and we\u2019re trying to understand what causes that. Simply how does it work in detail, and also importantly when the sun becomes active with lots of sun spots and lots of magnetic activity that changes the wind pattern and changes the electric current. We want to understand both what it is on a regular day when there is no solar activity and then what it is when there is a lot of solar activity. Sue: Is there some other way you can do it without dispersing the lithium? Rowland: We\u2019re researching other ways. The lithium is actually harmless to the environment and we can show you more about that but it is tricky to use because it\u2019s very faint. You can\u2019t see it with your naked eye. You have to have special cameras to see it so we don\u2019t like to use it for that reason. It\u2019s hard measurement to make. We\u2019re researching other ways to put censors directly on the rocket to measure the wind and those are ongoing. We\u2019re trying to develop them now and one of the purposes of this mission was to do that. Between incorrectly framed data about unrelated studies of mass vaccination or West Nile virus spraying and the video,\u00a0AnonHQ concluded that \u201chopefully we\u2019ve established that this IS happening,\u201d when neither the article nor video had established any\u00a0such thing. What actually transpired was folks\u00a0(one of whom harassed a NASA scientist and encouraged others to do the same) misinterpreted\u00a0publicized\u00a0scientific research to\u00a0fit a pre-existing conspiracy theory. In the conversation between Rowland and Sue (during which portions were clearly elided) the only admissions made were those about the detail of upper atmosphere study, already publicly disclosed on a regular basis by NASA and linked in this article. The use of lithium in such research was neither\u00a0a\u00a0secret nor\u00a0cause for concern. NASA published an article\u00a0in January 2013 explaining its purpose, one of many highlighting projects of the nature Rowland discussed: NASA successfully launched a Terrier-Improved Orion suborbital rocket at 5:50 p.m. EST this evening from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. During the flight, two red-colored lithium vapor trails were produced. Reports from those viewing the launch or vapor trails came from as far away as the Outer Banks, N.C.; eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Two different methods for creating the lithium vapor were tested to determine which configuration is best for observing various science phenomena in space. NASA has two missions later this year that will use lithium trails to assist scientists in observing events in space \u2026 In the technology test launch, two canisters in the rocket\u2019s payload section contained solid metal lithium rods or chips embedded in a thermite cake. The thermite was ignited and produced heat to vaporize the lithium. The vapor was released in space to be detected and tracked optically. The lithium combustion process posed no threat to the public during the release in space. When heated, the lithium rods change to lithium vapor and small amounts of lithium oxide. The thermite reaction produces iron and aluminum oxide. NASA similarly reported the same sort of research\u00a0in\u00a0July 2011, in an\u00a0openly-available article\u00a0about the observation of\u00a0lithium trails in the upper atmosphere: The rockets \u2014 known as sounding rockets from the nautical term \u201cto sound,\u201d meaning to measure \u2014 will launch sometime between July 5 and 23 depending on ionospheric and weather conditions. NASA\u2019s sounding rocket program at Wallops dates back to the agency\u2019s inception in 1958. Not only do sounding rockets offer a low cost way to access space, they also provide access to areas of the atmosphere too low for satellites. In this experiment, the scientists will fly two pair of rockets. One in each pair will measure data about the charged or \u201cionized\u201d gas \u2014 called plasma \u2014 as well as the neutral gas, through which it travels. The other will shoot out a long trail of lithium gas to track the wind movement. The instrumented rockets are 40 feet long and 17 inches in diameter, carrying a payload of 600 lbs. The lithium rockets are 14 inches in diameter and are about six feet long. Beginning July 5, the team will set up each day from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT, ready to launch as soon as there\u2019s evidence of currents in the ionosphere as well as a crystal clear skies \u2013 necessary for successful observation of the lithium trail. With all the focus conspiracy sites placed on NASA, none appeared to discover the agency\u2019s explanation of purpose for lithium in rocket launches (published in 1958 and available freely on the agency\u2019s web site): Chemical propellants in common use deliver specific impulse values ranging from about 175 up to about 300 seconds. The most energetic chemical propellants are theoretically capable of specific impulses up to about 400 seconds. High values of specific impulse are obtained from high exhaust-gas temperature, and from exhaust gas having very low (molecular) weight. To be efficient, therefore, a propellant should have a large heat of combustion to yield high temperatures, and should produce combustion products containing simple, light molecules embodying such elements as hydrogen (the lightest), carbon, oxygen, fluorine, and the lighter metals (aluminum, beryllium, lithium) \u2026 Devices such as the nuclear rocket must use some chemical as a working fluid or propellant, although no energy is supplied to the rocket by any chemical reaction \u2026 Propellants that would be suitable for use in electric propulsion devices are the easily ionized metals. The one most generally considered is cesium; next best are rubidium, potassium, sodium, and lithium. On 21 April 2016, we spoke with both Rowland and NASA\u2019s Keith Koehler. Koehler confirmed that the tracer rockets in question operated at far higher altitudes than commercial aircraft (chemtrail conspiracies focus on lower altitudes). Koehler explained why vapor tracers were\u00a0necessary to measure atmospheric conditions: Vapor tracers used in NASA suborbital rocket missions allow scientist to see that which is not visible to the naked eye. They are used to measure atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, typically between 50 and 248 miles altitude (Commercial aircraft fly around six miles altitude.). The vapor is released along a portion of the rocket trajectory. The small amount of vapor is then visible from the ground. By tracking their motions directly with cameras on the ground (or in an airplane), these tracers make it possible to observe the movements of the upper atmosphere or the ionosphere directly. The purpose of the measurements is to understand how the natural upper atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts behave, not to change them. The releases would therefore have little value if they were changing the behavior of the upper atmosphere or ionosphere. The tracers are released in a part of the atmosphere where meteors from space deposit 100 to 200 tons of metallic material every day across the globe compared to a one-pound tracer release, for example. The meteors contain the same types of metallic material used in the tracers.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":2473}

The ad doesn\u2019t explain that despite that block, the bill still could have provided money to fight Zika both in Puerto Rico and the United States. Nothing passed due to the gridlock over that issue. As for the statement about Rubio\u2019s voting record.\"","premise":"\"As the number of Floridians infected with the Zika virus continues to escalate, political groups and and candidates have lobbed attacks in the U.S. Senate battle in Florida. NARAL Pro-Choice America, a liberal organization that supports abortion rights, attacked Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s record on Zika in an ad airing on TV in Orlando and West Palm Beach and online. NARAL endorsed Rubio\u2019s opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter. \"\"The Zika virus is here. It\u2019s dangerous to pregnant women. And it has no cure. But Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency,\"\" states the narrator while text states that Rubio \"\"voted against contraception and family planning.\"\" The narrator then continues: \"\"And Marco Rubio continues to be against a woman's right to choose an abortion even if they are infected with the Zika virus.\"\" The ad shows video of someone clad in protective gear spraying for mosquitoes and anxious looking women including one who is pregnant. The ad began airing as Congress returned from recess to debate Zika funding again. On Sept. 6, a Senate bill failed to receive the necessary votes to move forward. We will zero in on Rubio\u2019s votes related to Zika. Rubio\u2019s voting record and public statements about Zika show that he has repeatedly shown support for Zika funding requests, including by President Barack Obama. The ad is referring to Rubio\u2019s votes in favor of Zika legislation that would have cut funding to one organization in Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Planned Parenthood. Zika bills In February, Obama requested $1.9 billion for vaccine research, testing and mosquito control related to Zika. Rubio announced his support for Obama\u2019s request at a press conference in Miami April 8. A timeline from Rubio\u2019s office states he was the first congressional Republican to announce his support. Since that time, Rubio has repeatedly called on his colleagues in floor speeches, media outlets and press conferences to pass a bill. On May 12, Rubio and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, announced they would introduce legislation to provide the full $1.9 billion request. \"\"There's no reason every proposal to address Zika cannot be bipartisan and earn broad support, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final outcome that fully addresses the problem,\"\" Rubio said at the time. On May 17, Rubio voted with the majority, 68-29, for a motion on an amendment by \u00a0Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.,\u00a0and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to provide $1.1 billion to combat Zika. Rubio reluctantly\u00a0voted for the compromise measure while still calling for Obama\u2019s full funding request. Two days later, the Senate passed the full bill 89-8 with Rubio voting with the majority. The bill called for spending $1.1 billion to prevent, prepare and respond to the Zika virus domestically and internationally including on the development of a vaccine. House and Senate negotiators then got together in a conference committee. Republicans added a clause to block any money for Profamilias, the Puerto Rican branch of Planned Parenthood. The services of that family planning agency are relevant here because Zika can be transmitted through sex, and condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika. Profamilias served 8,000 people in 2015. Democrats saw that as a \"\"poison pill\"\" intended to doom the bill, while Republicans said Democrats were refusing to compromise. While the bill would have blocked funding for Profamilias, it would not have blocked funding for Puerto Rico entirely. The ad omits that the bill provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island. Puerto Rico has 20 community health centers operating at 84 sites. Profamilias has seven clinics on the island, and in each area there is another type of facility that would have been eligible for Zika funding. The ad cites two Rubio votes in June on the appropriations bill that included the $1.1 billion for Zika. The first vote, on June 14, was a motion to proceed and passed 94-3. So NARAL is attacking Rubio for voting in favor of something that was supported by virtually every senator of both parties. The second vote was on June 28 when the Senate voted 52-48 to bring up the Zika measure. It failed to reach the 60-vote threshold, so the underlying bill didn\u2019t reach an up or down vote. Rubio voted for the measure. \"\"Shame on Washington for failing to pass Zika funding,\"\" Rubio said after the bill died. \"\"We\u2019ve been on top of this issue for five months, and it\u2019s a failure of both parties in this town, including the president of the United States, that it\u2019s taken this long to even get to this point.\"\" One final note about the ad\u2019s attack on Rubio for opposing abortion, including for women with Zika. Rubio told Politico in August: \"\"I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.\"\" Our ruling NARAL\u2019s TV ad said, \"\"Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika).\"\" The text on the screen stated that Rubio \"\"voted against contraception and family planning.\"\" The ad creates a misleading impression that Rubio\u2019s votes show he is indifferent to funding clinics to combat Zika.

One item that circulated on social media played on that controversy by purporting to show two seemingly contradictory CNN articles about hydroxychloroquine, published three months apart and co-authored by the same person. One criticized Trump for being \u201cwrong\u201d about hydroxychloroquine, and the other acknowledged that a study had found hydroxychloroquine helpful in treating coronavirus patients:  However, these articles were not contradictory in content, and they were presented in a misleading manner in the above example to make them seem so. The first article, published on April 11, 2020, and written by Elizabeth Cohen and Dr. Minali Nigam, was headlined \u201cPresident Trump is wrong in so many ways about hydroxychloroquine studies. Here are the facts.\u201d This article did not assert that hydroxychloroquine had no value whatsoever as a treatment for the coronavirus disease. Rather, it pointed out four specific ways in which Trump had made claims about hydroxychloroquine studies that were contrary to what doctors were expressing about the subject at the time: 1) How soon until we know if hydroxychloroquine works against coronavirus? Trump says \u201cdays.\u201d Doctors say weeks or months. 2) French researchers have already done a clinical study showing hydroxychloroquine works as a treatment for coronavirus. Doesn\u2019t that tell us something? Trump says yes. Doctors say the study was terrible, so no. 3) Have some people tried to delay hydroxychloroquine clinical trials? Trump says yes, and he came to the rescue. Doctors say they have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. 4) Is hydroxychloroquine safe for coronavirus patients? Trump says yes. Doctors say the drug can have serious side effects. The second article, published on July 3 2020, and written by Maggie Fox, Andrea Kane, and Elizabeth Cohen, had its headline deceptively truncated in the above example to remove the skepticism it expressed about a recent hydroxychloroquine study. The full headline read \u201cStudy finds hydroxychloroquine may have boosted survival, but other researchers have doubts,\u201d and the text of the article detailed the dispute over the study\u2019s findings: A surprising new study found the controversial antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine helped patients better survive in the hospital. But the findings, like the federal government\u2019s use of the drug itself, were disputed. A team at Henry Ford Health System in southeast Michigan said their study of 2,541 hospitalized patients found that those given hydroxychloroquine were much less likely to die. t\u2019s a surprising finding because several other studies have found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine, a drug originally developed to treat and prevent malaria. President Donald Trump touted the drug heavily, but later studies found not only did patients not do better if they got the drug, they were more likely to suffer cardiac side effects. Researchers not involved in the Henry Ford study pointed out it wasn\u2019t of the same quality of the studies showing hydroxychloroquine did not help patients, and said other treatments, such as the use of the steroid dexamethasone, might have accounted for the better survival of some patients \u2026 They noted that the Henry Ford team did not randomly treat patients but selected them for various treatments based on certain criteria. [Eli Rosenberg, associate professor of epidemiology at the University at Albany School of Public Health] also pointed out that the Detroit paper excluded 267 patients \u2014 nearly 10% of the study population \u2014 who had not yet been discharged from the hospital. He said this might have skewed the results to make hydroxychloroquine look better than it really was. Those patients might have still been in the hospital because they were very sick, and if they died, excluding them from the study made hydroxychloroquine look like more of a lifesaver than it really was.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":7766}

The health care system needs to continue to be critical of interventions that don\u2019t work or are harmful. It\u2019s clear that we haven\u2019t had good evidence for much of how this old procedure has been done. Parents worry when their children can\u2019t sleep well or have other problems related to enlarged tonsils, but surgery, as this story notes, is not without complications. Instead of giving the subject a light touch, the story dug into some of the details necessary to give parents the information they need to make good decisions.

The story could have done much more to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but we give it points here for addressing the lack of support for tonsil surgeries, which most parents likely assume are a standard part of growing up. \u201cThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn\u2019t until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\u201d Later it says, \u201cDespite hundreds of studies, there\u2019s still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\u201d And it says, \u201cThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children if they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\u201d The story does not engage in overt disease-mongering. Good caveats that \u201cnot all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered. About 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year.\u201d The story only quotes one physician, and that source is a surgeon We would have liked to have seen more independent sources tapped \u2013 a pediatrician or family medicine doctor would have been helpful. No meaningful discussion comparing alternative treatments. The story was focused on surgery. There was no discussion of prevention \u2013 of indoor allergens (and avoiding\/treating them with antihistamines) or of obesity. The story does a great job explaining how tonsil surgery as a first resort has evolved over the years. It is clear from the story that surgery is not novel. The story definitely does not rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":2097}
{"claim_id":"9854","hypothesis":"Low-dose lithium reduces side effects from most common treatment for Parkinson's disease","explanation_1":"We appreciate that there is a need to get a reader\u2019s attention with the title of any document, including news releases. This headline grabs readers with the suggestion that lithium \u201creduces side effects of most common treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d a statement that\u2019s simply not supported as no humans with Parkinson\u2019s disease were studied. Treating mice with an induced form of the disease is not the same as treating actual people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Having said that, the release recovers quickly \u2014 in the very first sentence \u2014 to clarify that the research was done in mice, which is commendable. The release also includes some useful caveats regarding the quality of evidence and what additional research needs to be done before lithium can be considered a viable option in humans. A bit more information about the actual research findings and potential harms of lithium would have been helpful. Parkinson\u2019s disease is primarily a disease of the late middle-aged and elderly population. At the moment there are between 500,000 and 1,500,000 people in the US with the disease and approximately 60,000 are diagnosed annually. Although there are now numerous innovative approaches to managing symptoms, dopamine replacement therapy is the dominant treatment. As noted in the news release, the effects of dopamine replacement on the classic symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s are frequently replaced by a set of equally crippling movement disorders. An inexpensive and low-risk solution for the treatment related movement disorders would be a welcomed option for sufferers of the disease and their families","premise":"After a misleading headline, the release establishes quickly that the research is in mice and that clinical trials haven\u2019t been performed. And at this early stage of development, the cost of treatment is not an issue. So we rule this Not Applicable. Having said that, if lithium augmentation of carbidopa\/levodopa did indeed work in humans, the low cost of lithium is a distinct advantage to patients. We aren\u2019t really provided with much in the way of information here \u2014 the number of animals involved or how they measured the actual improvement in abnormal movements or what the results were. One of the researchers talks about \u201csignificant behavioral improvement,\u201d but is that \u201csignificant\u201d only in a statistical sense or something that would be noticeable to an average person? We are also told, \u201clithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis\u201d but without really informing the reader with why this is important. We are also told about findings from two earlier studies,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\u201d said Andersen. \u201cThe treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d It would have been helpful to have some numbers here, or a more thorough description of what the study actually showed. The news release is silent on the issue of the potential for toxicity with lithium augmentation. Although the research was conducted in mice, the researchers did note the potential for toxicity in their publication, \u201c\u2026in a few reported cases lithium treat- ment was suggested to be detrimental to PD patients and to cause side effects\u2026\u201d Since lithium is also used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, it\u2019s possible the release could have pulled from the literature on this use to discuss potential side effects. On its own, the headline of this news release is misleading: \u201cLow-dose lithium reduces side effects from most common treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d Any reader would take this to mean that we\u2019re talking about humans with Parkinson\u2019s disease, when the research was done in mice with an induced form of the disease. That being said, we applaud the release for clarifying in the very first sentence that we\u2019re talking about mice \u2014 something that\u2019s not often done in news releases. We also think\u00a0the excellent comments of Dr. Simon provided some clarity and placed the study into the right context. \u201cThis study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD\u2026..One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen\u2019s lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\u201d\u00a0So, although the headline alone would be given an unsatisfactory rating, the immediate and extensive clarifications about the quality of evidence saved the day. The release notes that Parkinson\u2019s disease is diagnosed in 60,000 new people each year, a figure which is supported by the NIH. It would have been helpful to state one\u2019s lifetime risk of developing the disease, to help put this number in context. The funding source for the research is clearly identified in the release. However, we are not advised that the Buck Institute and the two senior authors of the paper filed a patent application for low-dose lithium in Parkinsons (US20130017274 A1). Although levodopa\/carbidopa is the main approach to treatment, other drugs are available that are not mentioned. In addition to medical therapy, deep brain stimulation is also available at most academic medical centers. The release makes it clear that lithium is currently available and used for psychiatric illness. Given that the drug is available, it\u2019s conceivable that desperate patients will seek treatment with lithium based on these findings \u2014 which is why it\u2019s all the more important to carefully qualify the results in the headline. It is clear that the use of lithium for this purpose is new. The release also establishes that there was previous research leading up to the study. The headline of the release cannot be justified on the basis of the information provided or by the results of the study itself.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":6736}
{"claim_id":"35250","hypothesis":"People started to ignore social distancing rules during the 1918 pandemic, leading to a second wave of infections that killed more people than all of World War I. ","explanation_1":"What's true: More people died during the 1918 flu pandemic than in all of WWI, with the majority of deaths occurring during the deadly second wave of the influenza outbreak. In general, places that disregarded social distancing rules saw more influenza cases. What's false: The second wave of the influenza outbreak started before the end of WWI and was largely fueled by sickened soldiers traveling home to hospitals.","premise":"In mid-April 2020, as some U.S. cities saw crowds of people protesting against shelter-in place or stay-home orders implemented to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a meme started circulating that claimed the majority of deaths during the 1918-19 pandemic occurred after people started to ignore social distancing guidelines:  There is a lot of truth in the above-displayed meme, for instance: However, the timeline presented in this meme is inaccurate and, contrary to what the text implies, the second wave of this pandemic was not fueled mainly by a lack of social distancing. The 1918 pandemic, commonly known by the misnomer \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d left at least 50 million people dead around the world, including 675,000 in the United States. Comparatively speaking, about 20 million soldiers and civilians died in WWI. There were three waves of illness during this pandemic, which started in the spring of 1918 and subsided in the summer of 1919, the most deadly of which was the second wave that peaked in the fall of 1918. We haven\u2019t been able to definitively determine the percentage of deaths that occurred during the deadly second wave. We can say, however, that the U.S. saw close to 200,000 deaths from the pandemic in October 1918 alone. The U.S. lost approximately 115,000 soldiers during all of WWI. While the majority of deaths did occur during the second wave, these deaths can\u2019t be solely attributed to a lack of social distancing after the war. In fact, a\u00a0timeline of the 1918 pandemic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that the second wave started in September 1918, approximately two months before Germany officially surrendered on Nov. 11, ending WWI. History.com notes that the second wave of the 1918 pandemic was largely fueled by sickened soldiers who traveled to countries across Europe, the U.S., and Africa: While the global pandemic lasted for two years, the vast majority of deaths were packed into three especially cruel months in the fall of 1918. Historians now believe that the fatal severity of the Spanish flu\u2019s \u201csecond wave\u201d was caused by a mutated virus spread by wartime troop movements \u2026 In late August 1918, military ships departed the English port city of Plymouth carrying troops unknowingly infected with this new, far deadlier strain of Spanish flu. As these ships arrived in cities like Brest in France, Boston in the United States and Freetown in west Africa, the second wave of the global pandemic began. \u201cThe rapid movement of soldiers around the globe was a major spreader of the disease,\u201d says James Harris, a historian at Ohio State University who studies both infectious disease and World War I. \u201cThe entire military industrial complex of moving lots of men and material in crowded conditions was certainly a huge contributing factor in the ways the pandemic spread.\u201d While military parades and a lack of social distancing at the end of the war did not cause the second wave of the 1918 pandemic, they did exacerbate the problem. Much like today, many cities in the U.S. closed schools, businesses, and other public spaces during the 1918 pandemic. (You can read some old news clippings urging social distancing here.) These actions were largely successful in slowing the spread of the disease, as noted in a recent study from the Journal of the American Society of Cytopathology:","label":3,"__index_level_0__":7324}
{"claim_id":"10673","hypothesis":"Beyond wrinkles: Botox is a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer\u2019s cramp","explanation_1":"This is a thoroughly reported story on a medical therapy that merits skepticism but which has also earned a reasonable amount of scientific respect in recent years. It does a nice job of explaining the myriad uses of Botox in medicine today and issues some needed cautions about potential harms, nonapproved uses, and misuse. The story\u2019s sources are plentiful and appear to be balanced. But is this enough? How good is the evidence to support the various uses of Botox? Are there reasonable alternatives to Botox for some of the conditions it treats? Is it okay to tease a national audience with a headline that shouts one thing, but place deeper in the story the caveats that suggest another? There is extraordinary variability in the quality of the research on Botox from one medical condition to another\u2014missing information important for a national audience that inevitably includes people searching desperately for solutions to intractable problems. For example, our quick literature search turned up more than a score of randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews on the use of Botox for the involuntary muscle contortions that cause the painful neck disorder known as cervical dystonia\u2013and just one, very small, inadequate trial on Botox treatments for low back pain. The story fails to quantify side effects, most of which seem to be dismissed as transient. And readers might be better served if the story put more meat on the bones of alternative approaches (including no treatment) to some of the conditions Botox treats. Indeed, one could argue that the story\u2019s ultimate effect is that of treatment mongering\u2014simply because it shines so much (mostly flattering) light on Botox. The admonition from one source\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t demand a certain treatment just because you saw a headline\u201d\u2014can\u2019t compete with the magazine cover\u2019s actual headline: \u201cThe Botox Boom\u201d followed inside by, \u201cYou thought Botox was all about looks? It's also a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer's cramp\u201d. In spite of the story\u2019s multiple caveats about Botox, the headline hypes a therapy that may be a boon for some, but a bust for others.","premise":"\"The cover story points out that Botox is big business\u2014accounting for some $830 million in annual sales. It explains that insurance companies will reimburse treatments for FDA-approved uses and in some cases nonapproved uses. It mentions cost of wrinkle treatments in a sidebar, but it doesn\u2019t compare the costs of Botox with the costs of the alternatives\u2013for wrinkles, neck pain, or other problems\u2014nor does it attempt to account for the expense of office visits and other associated costs. The story provides no quantitative estimates of the benefits of using Botox. The story mentions several of the major side effects of Botox, points out that the long-term effects of multiple injections over many years are unknown, and cautions readers about the potential dangers of using Botox for off-label uses. A sidebar in the story warns readers about the dangers of highly concentrated injections derived from bootlegged Botox. But the article\u00a0could have added more about the frequency of side effects that are listed in the package insert. About a fifth of patients treated for spasmodic eye-blinking develop drooping lid; about a fifth of those treated for cervical muscle spasms have difficulty swallowing; and recipients of wrinkle treatments frequently suffer bruising or swelling. Though the news article hints that there are good studies and bad (\u201cWhere the science is sound\u2026\u201d), urges caution for unapproved uses, and notes that rigorous trials are underway for several conditions, it provides no true description of the quality of evidence to support the use of Botox for the painful neck condition known as cervical dystonia or any other condition. In fact, there is extraordinary variability in the quality of the literature on Botox from one condition to another\u2013important information for a national audience that inevitably includes people searching desperately for solutions to intractable problems. High-quality research to support many of its unapproved uses has yet to be published. The news article suggests that some of the conditions Botox treats are legitimate medical problems. But it also seems to medicalize other conditions such as facial wrinkles and sweating that are simply the normal consequence of life, and details how off-label uses are considered \"\"quality-of-life saving.\"\" One could argue that the story\u2019s ultimate effect is that of treatment mongering\u2013because it shines so much (mostly flattering) light on Botox. The admonition from one source\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t demand a certain treatment just because you saw a headline\u201d\u2014can\u2019t compete with the U.S. News cover headline itself: \u201cThe Botox Boom\u201d followed inside by, \u201cYou thought Botox was all about looks? It's also a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer's cramp\u201d. This story cites 8 sources who represent a range of views and interests. Where appropriate, the article lists potential conflicts of interest; several have received funding from pharmaceutical companies and others appear to be unbiased professionals. This story mentions treatments other than Botox (deep brain stimulation for cervical dystonia, drugs for headaches, and drugs or surgery for urological problems). But these are light sketches against a bold tapestry of information on Botox. There is no discussion of surgical or topical alternatives for wrinkles, medical alternatives for dystonias, or non-treatment for several conditions, including sweating. Readers would benefit from more subtle comparisons to see how Botox measures up against other therapies. The US News story explains that botulinum toxin (brand name Botox) is FDA-approved for some medical conditions and not approved for many others, and rightly suggests that Botox is widely available. The news story explains that the use of Botox has expanded rapidly since it was first rolled out a decade ago as a fix for wrinkled brows. No obvious use of text from a press release.\"","label":3,"__index_level_0__":5081}
