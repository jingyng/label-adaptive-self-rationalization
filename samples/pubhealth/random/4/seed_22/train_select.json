{"claim_id":"22143","hypothesis":"I\u2019ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning.","explanation_1":"Sen. Herb Kohl says he\u2019s never done any negative campaigning","premise":"\"Twenty-three years into his Senate tenure, Wisconsin\u2019s Herb Kohl hasn\u2019t announced whether he will seek another six-year term in 2012. But as Republicans step up their criticism of him, Kohl is making crystal clear his disdain for the kind of rough-and-tumble campaign environment that almost surely would be part of another campaign. Compared to his last couple races when Kohl used his massive personal fortune to vanquish underfunded opponents with soft-sell TV ads, it would be a new environment for the senator who owns the Milwaukee Bucks and built the Kohl\u2019s department and grocery store chains. In remarks to reporters in Madison on April 28, 2011, Kohl ruminated about the state of today\u2019s campaigns. He said \"\"people don\u2019t like anybody in public life\"\" because of \"\"venomous\"\" attacks and sniping among congressional members, something he said he engages in \"\"hardly at all.\"\" Then he got specific: \"\"I\u2019ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning. And I don\u2019t get into any personal jousts with other people in public life. But that\u2019s just my style.\"\" So has Kohl really avoided any negative campaigning? That\u2019s quite a claim in this age of mud-slinging and aggressive campaign tactics. We decided to check it out. Of course, it would be impossible to track down every campaign statement Kohl made since 1988 and copies of decades-old TV ads. So we focused our look-back to media descriptions of TV ads, debates and the candidates\u2019 strategies in his four races. We also talked to the people who should know best: several of his former opponents or their aides, Kohl\u2019s campaign staff, and a longtime political reporter. Kohl has of course benefited from negative attacks launched by groups supporting his campaigns, but he spoke only of his own campaigns\u2019 conduct, so we\u2019ll limit our review to that. One more note before we begin: Because there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes \"\"negative\"\" campaigning, we asked Team Kohl what exactly he meant by his claim. \"\"Sen. Kohl has said that he believes campaigning is about telling the people of Wisconsin what he\u2019s done and what he plans to do, not tearing down his opponent or telling people not to vote for them,\"\" Kohl press secretary Lynn Becker said. \"\"He has not been deliberately malicious or factually dishonest in his campaigns or while serving in public office.\"\" Indeed, his two most recent opponents said there was no negative campaigning in their contests -- and had high praise for Kohl. \"\"He never did anything negative in his campaign. He\u2019ll have the job as long as he wants the job,\"\" said John Gillespie, founder of Rawhide Boys Ranch, who lost to Kohl in 2000. \"\"Say hi to Herb if you talk to him. Tell him I owe him a dinner,\"\" said Robert Lorge, Kohl\u2019s 2006 rival. Fair enough. Those were landslide wins. What about the earlier contests? 1988: Kohl was a surprise entrant in the Democratic primary, winning the nomination comfortably over former Gov. Tony Earl, Ed Garvey and Doug La Follette. He frustrated his rivalsby limiting his debate participation and spending millions on TV ads. At the time, Earl\u2019s media consultant David Axelrod charged that Kohl\u2019s popular slogan -- \"\"Nobody\u2019s Senator But Yours\"\" -- was an implicit negative attack. It implied that candidates who -- unlike Kohl -- have to raise most of their campaign money are beholden to donors, said Axelrod, who later went on to help a guy named Barack Obama get elected president. Earl attacked Kohl as uninformed and error-prone, prompting Kohl campaign aide Bill Christofferson to call Earl \"\"desperate\"\" and guilty of misrepresentation. Insiders on both sides agree that Kohl ran no attack ads in the primary -- and none in the very tight general election that saw Republican state legislator Susan Engeleiter close the gap to just a few pointswith a series of ads targeting Kohl in the closing weeks. Engeleiter herself told us she has \"\"nothing but positive recollections\"\" of a \"\"pretty cordial campaign.\"\" She also praised Kohl\u2019s dealing with her when she later was confirmed as administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. La Follette and Garvey say today that they wouldn\u2019t call Kohl\u2019s primary race negative. Regarding Kohl\u2019s slogan, La Follette agreed with Kohl aide Christofferson, who said: \u00a0\"\"Herb Kohl was talking about himself, not anyone else, when he promised to be 'nobody's senator but yours.'\"\" Indeed, Kohl explicitly used his positive campaign ads as a selling point, and called his victory a blow against negative campaigning. 1994: In his first re-election campaign, Kohl wasted little time aggressively portraying Republican opponent Robert Welch, a state lawmaker from Redgranite, as an \"\"extreme conservative\"\" and flip-flopper. At an early debate, he cited Welch\u2019s no-exceptions stance against abortion and his vow never to vote for a tax hike as \"\"extreme.\"\" According to media accounts, he did not explain the flip-flop charge. Afterwards, Welch told reporters Kohl was \"\"nastier than I expected.\"\" Later, after Welch attempted to tie Kohl to President Clinton, Kohl launched a rare TV ad that focused on an opponent by name. Another followed. The ads accused Welch of distorting Kohl\u2019s record. One said that \"\"fellow Republicans\"\" had criticized Welch\u2019s tactics -- something deemed misleading in a Milwaukee Journal fact check. The exchange led Welch to accuse Kohl of running a \"\"multimillion dollar mudslinging campaign.\"\" Kohl said it was Welch who went negative. The rhetoric heated up. At one point in the race, after Welch accused Kohl of \"\"religion bashing,\"\" Kohl spokesman Jeffrey Gillis said that \"\" Welch's attack again shows that he'll say or do anything to get elected.\"\" So, that seems like quite a bit of snarling. Looking back, though, Welch\u2019s campaign manager Mike Maxwell doesn\u2019t have strong opinions about the back and forth. \"\"I don\u2019t know that Kohl was particularly negative through that election,\"\" he told us. He didn\u2019t recall the \"\"distort\"\" ad that Kohl ran. He did say that some might consider the \"\"extreme\"\" charge a negative attack. Kohl, Maxwell recalled, \"\"just had overwhelming resources and then he signed (Bucks first round draft choice Glenn Robinson) six days before the election.\"\" (We could not reach Welch for comment). Kenneth Lamke, a Milwaukee Sentinel reporter who covered the 1994 race, offered the strongest opinion we heard on whether Kohl went negative against Welch. He says yes. Lamke said the \"\"extreme\"\" charge by Kohl was \"\"within bounds but uncharacteristic of Herb.\"\" Lamke viewed the attack as unprovoked and an exaggeration; Gillis, the Kohl aide, said it was a response to the drumbeat of criticism of Kohl during the Republican primary. Lamke, we should note, asked us to describe his personal politics as \"\"leans Republican.\"\" We asked several political scientists to characterize the language of the Kohl ad. They reacted cautiously because we could not provide the ad itself, just direct quotes from it in media accounts. That makes it impossible to fully judge the tone. Vanderbilt professor John Geer, an author of a much-cited book on negative campaigning, said it sounded like a \"\"tame\"\" response ad -- \"\"not the kind of classic negative ad the public doesn\u2019t like.\"\" Darrell West, of the Brookings Institution, agreed. UW-Madison\u2019s Ken Goldstein said Kohl\u2019s ad met the academic research definition of \"\"negative\"\" because it focused on Welch, not Kohl. The test of whether it was unfair is whether it was accurate, he said. So Kohl\u2019s campaigns have been remarkably low-confrontation affairs, with the most notable exception being 1994, the first -- and perhaps only -- time Kohl aired TV spots going after an opponent. So how does Kohl fare on his statement that he has never campaigned negatively? Clearly, Kohl has spent the vast bulk of his time and money on upbeat, positive ads. Even his opponents agree strongly with that -- one even wants to buy him dinner. The only ad that pops up as arguably negative is the 1994 \"\"distort\"\" spot against Welch. It drew some critical attention, but is viewed as a pretty tame response ad. Beyond that, Kohl\u2019s campaigns have engaged in some labeling and name calling. And Kohl\u2019s aggressive 1994 portrayal of Welch as an \"\"extremist\"\" was arguably negative. Kohl is mostly on target here, with some minor exceptions. .\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":2410}

Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.\"","premise":"\"Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine \"\"Katty\"\" Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. \"\"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States,\"\" Kay said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \"\"Because when people really need it,\u00a0and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate.\"\" Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFact\u00a0and PolitiFact\u00a0busy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kay\u2019s claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kay\u2019s source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percent\u00a0for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine\u00a0in 2013, according to the WHO data. (The\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts\u00a0the measles immunization rate in the United States is\u00a091.9 percent. But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States 91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent  Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, it\u2019s not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States\u2019 include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a \"\"major public health success\"\" that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. \"\"I\u2019m old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available,\"\" Troisi said, \"\"and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason we\u2019re seeing this refusal is because parents haven\u2019t seen what these diseases can do.\"\" Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, \"\"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States.\"\" We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":6360}
{"claim_id":"27272","hypothesis":"\"A photograph showing an odd-looking, large bat with an elongated face known as a \"\"hammerhead bat.\"","explanation_1":"Images of the hammer-headed bat are often met with skepticism, and some viewers claim that this odd-looking creature could be the real-world animal responsible for various sightings of mythical creatures such as the \u201cNew Jersey Devil.\u201d","premise":"Digital editing has been responsible for the creation of images of some fantastically fictional looking creatures, such as seven-headed snakes, pink-horned rhinos, and impossibly small kittens. In July 2018, many social media users wondered if they were witnessing a similar creation in an image of an odd-looking, large animal said to be a \u201chammerhead bat\u201d:  We have not been able to pinpoint the exact origins of this photograph, but we can say that the hammerhead bat (also known as the \u201chammer-headed bat\u201d) is a genuine animal that looks like the one pictured here. The hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) is a megabat found in the tropical forests of central Africa. A profile on the large fruit bat from Bat Magazine provides some more information about this unusual-looking animal: The hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), widely distributed in equatorial Africa, is one of three species of African fruit bat thought to be asymptomatically infected with the Ebola virus; though scientists do not know if the species is an incidental host or a reservoir of Ebolavirus. The little-collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata) and the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the other two species. The species is locally common and is typically found in lowland tropical moist forests, riverine forests, swamp forests, mangroves and palm forests, where it roosts in trees. Although colonies up to 25 bats have been observed, the average hammer-headed fruit bat roost is fewer than five bats. The hammer-headed bat, with wingspans up to 38 inches (97 cm), is Africa\u2019s largest bat. Strong sexual dimorphism is observed in the species, as males are significantly larger than females. Males have a large head with enlarged rostrum, larynx and lips that allows for the production of loud honking calls; the appearance of females is similar to most other fruit bats. The species has a \u201clek\u201d mating system whereby a few hundred males gather into groups (leks) to attract female mates. Although the hammerhead bat is a relatively large bat, the viral image may have given some viewers a false impression of the animal\u2019s true size. The person holding this fruit bat is extending the animal out toward the camera, and since the bat is closer to the lens than the human, the forced perspective makes the animal appear larger than normal. Photographs exhibiting the forced perspective optical illusion have caused confusion about the relative sizes of frogs, rats, snakes, and half-eaten sharks. As noted by Bats Magazine, the hammer-headed bat can possess a wingspan of nearly 40 inches, but it\u2019s average body length is only about 10 inches: H. monstrosus is the largest bat found in Africa, with males being significantly larger than females. Males range in mass from 228 g to 450 g, averaging 377 g. Females are about half the size, weighing from 218 to 377 g, and averaging 275 g. Males range in length from 220 to 280 mm, with an average of 250 mm. Females measure 195 to 225 mm, averaging 210 mm. Males have a wingspan of 686 to 970 mm, and females have an average wingspan of 840 mm.

{"claim_id":"473","hypothesis":"Ring of fire: Australian state declares emergency as wildfires approach Sydney.","explanation_1":"Australia\u2019s most populous state declared its second emergency in as many months on Thursday as extreme heat and strong winds stoked more than 100 bushfires, including three major blazes on Sydney\u2019s doorstep.","premise":"A day after Australia recorded its hottest day on record, thick smoke blanketed the harbor city, shrouded the Opera House and brought many outdoor activities to a halt. The state of emergency declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities across New South Wales, which is home to more than 7 million people. Authorities said nearly 120 fires remained ablaze by late afternoon, more than half of which are uncontrolled, and with temperatures forecast to top 45 degrees Celsius (113\u00b0F) in some areas, officials warned residents to be on high alert. \u201cThe firefront has been spreading very quickly and intensely,\u201d NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney, adding that two firefighters had been airlifted to hospital with burns to their faces and airways. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very difficult and dangerous set of circumstances.\u201d  Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian advised people to make sure \u201cyou are prepared to change your plans should circumstances change.\u201d  In Shoalhaven, a popular coastal destination some 190 km (120 miles) south of Sydney, local mayor Amanda Findley said people were poised to evacuate. \u201cThere is a large amount of smoke looming over the city, which shows how close the fire is,\u201d Findley told Reuters by telephone. \u201cIt is extremely hot and windy now so we are all worried the fire could spread. People are really worried that they may lose everything.\u201d  The RFS posted footage on its official Twitter account showing firefighters tackling one of the three blazes ringing Sydney. A waterbomber aircraft was dwarfed by thick grey and black billowing cloud as it attempted to douse flames in bushland just meters away from homes. Australia has been battling wildfires across much of its east coast for weeks, leaving six people dead, more than 680 homes destroyed and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland burnt. Berejiklian said as many as 40 homes had been destroyed on Thursday. Australia on Wednesday broke all-time heat records for the second day running, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9 degree Celsius, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Some 1,700 firefighters have been deployed across NSW, but officials warned that was still not enough to cover every potential danger and urged people in high risk areas to evacuate while it was still safe to do so. The current state of emergency will last for seven days, while a total fire ban that has been in place since Tuesday will remain until midnight on Saturday. The major fires around Sydney, which is home to more than 5 million people, have resulted in days of heavy pollution in the city usually known for its sparkling harbor and blue skies. One megafire in the Kanangra Boyd National Park to the city\u2019s southwest had crept to the very outskirts of Campbelltown, a suburb of 157,000 people. By late afternoon, Sydney was sitting at No.4 on the IQAir AirVisual live rankings of pollution in global cities, above Dhaka, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta. Many commuters have donned breathing masks in recent weeks as air quality has plunged to hazardous levels not previously seen in the city. NSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan said the service had experienced a 10% surge in call-outs for patients suffering respiratory conditions over the past week and urged susceptible people to remain indoors and keep their medication close. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has weathered a storm of criticism on social media in recent days for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency, adding to criticism that his government is failing to deliver adequate climate change policies. As local media reported Morrison was in Hawaii on a family holiday, about 500 protesters gathered outside his official Sydney residence to demand urgent action on climate change. Morrison\u2019s office refused to confirm his whereabouts. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, \u201cScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?\u201d referencing the leader\u2019s nickname and a decade-old international advertisement for Tourism Australia that was banned in several countries because the language was deemed offensive. Australia\u2019s low-lying Pacific neighbors have been particularly critical of the coal-rich nation\u2019s climate policies following modest progress at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid. \u201cIt was particularly disappointing to see our Pacific cousins in Australia actively standing in the way of progress at a time when we have been watching in horror as their own country is ablaze,\u201d Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine said in a statement on Wednesday.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":5884}

Patients will receive treatment free of charge for the first two weeks, he added. Thailand, which has a tradition of using cannabis to relieve pain and fatigue, legalized marijuana for medical use and research in 2017 to boost agricultural income. There are already around 25 cannabis clinics attached to general hospitals around the country but, unlike the newly-launched pilot clinic, they operate for just a few days a week due to a lack of specialized staff. The largest producer of medicinal cannabis is currently the health ministry\u2019s Government Pharmaceutical Organization. Kasetsart University\u2019s director of medical cannabis research, Natakorn Thasnas, told Reuters that the university would supply  2,200 kilograms of cannabis leaf to the ministry. Cannabis production, cultivation and sale has been limited to licensed Thai producers for the next four years to protect the domestic industry. Currently, only hospitals and research facilities are allowed to apply for cannabis production and extraction licenses, but the government is reviewing regulations to enable Thai businesses to apply for permits. Last year, Thailand dropped cannabis and hemp extracts from its narcotics list and proposed a draft law that would allow each household to grow six cannabis plants. Four types of drugs, containing different combinations of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psycho-active ingredient in cannabis, were given to patients to treat migraine, insomnia, neck pain and muscle stiffness, the ministry said in a statement. The pilot clinic, based in the Ministry of Public Health, expects to see between 200 to 300 patients daily. \u201cI was worried at first, but I studied the effects and decided it was better because its natural,\u201d said Waraporn Boonsri, 69, who received four vials of cannabis oil to help her sleep. Nearly 2,200 patients have registered at the clinic until March, a health official told Reuters. Anutin said there were plans for 77 clinics to be opened across the country, with one in every province.

Was this yet another glimpse into the machinations of a \u201cbridezilla,\u201d a gal so caught up in the plans for her wedding that she turns into a monster? Or was it something else? Example: [Dear Abby, 2003] MEMO TO MY ATTENDANTS: Hey, girls! Mom has your dresses for the wedding. She\u2019ll bring them to the shower next weekend. You can pick them up there. Allison sent me an e-mail asking what style shoes and jewelry to wear. Great question, Allison! There are so many details. I keep forgetting to tell my girls what to do.This is an excellent opportunity to go over my expectations for each of you: About the shoes, please wear tasteful flats. Most of you are taller than me. I\u2019d rather you not all tower over me. I want all of you to wear your hair down. Since Babs and Allison have similar hair, I\u2019d prefer that Babs straighten hers and let Allison be the curly-haired girl. After all, she\u2019s my friend and you are just bridesmaids! I\u2019m sure you understand. Judy and Molly, you have both mentioned that you intend to shed a few pounds. This would be the perfect time! Watch your diets; we will all start weekly weigh-ins. Allison could use some trimming down, too. Also, you should all stay away from alcohol for at least a week before the wedding. None of us should be puffy or bloated. I think this is mainly for Babs, as none of my ladies drink all that much. Other than that, I don\u2019t have any real suggestions. Oh, please don\u2019t go tanning! I prefer to blend in with you than stand out as the pale one! Judy, Allison and Molly, please call me. There are a few other things that I need to go over with you on this topic. Babs, you are Scotty\u2019s friend, so I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell you what needs to be corrected \u2014 plus, your own wedding is coming up after mine. So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already more than a little aware of what you need to work on. See y\u2019all on Saturday. Babs, remember you\u2019ll attend the shower with us girls rather than the paintball fun with the boys. Dress accordingly, dear! Bridezilla tales are nothing new to the Internet, and usually after blossoming briefly to horrify the masses, they quietly fade into obscurity. This one, however, gained a shot in the arm when it appeared in a Dear Abby column in September 2002. Readers sent the much-traveled e-mail to Abby, seeking her comments. She offered no opinion on whether the story was true but replied: If the document you sent me is on the level, the bride-to-be appears to have an abundance of unresolved control issues and an astounding lack of tact. Abby\u2019s observation was dead on. It also brings us back to the \u201cwas this for real or not?\u201d element of the tale. You see, if this had been a hoax, it would have been designed to make its purported author look especially heinous. And there\u2019s a strong chance that\u2019s exactly what happened. A couple of small sections of the earlier e-mail were left out of the Dear Abby version, namely: [Following \u201cMost of you are taller than me, so would rather you all not tower over me\u2019] Plus, many of you are unaware, but Addie is terribly ill and sometimes is paralyzed from the waist down. And we do want to take care of Adam\u2019s girl! [Following \u201cLindsay could use some trimming up too\u201d] Addie, you just take care of yourself. I know that some of us have trouble with food and I don\u2019t want to encourage any bad habits with those who have had problems in the past. (In the February 2002 original, all the participants had different names: The curly-haired friend was Lindsay instead of Allison; Leisha and Sissy were the gals who needed to lose weight, not Judy and Molly; Addie, instead of Babs, was the paintball-loving two-fisted drinker who was soon to marry the problematic Adam, not Scotty; and the now-nameless bride signed herself as Jenny.) A careful reading of the original reveals little digs are made at Addie (Babs) throughout the piece. Granted, brides do not always get along famously with their bridesmaids, but this level of barely suppressed hostility is unusual. The unrelenting Addie-bashing should sound a few distant warning bells in those tempted to take the letter at face value, because the behavior doesn\u2019t fit the occasion. Addie drinks too much, has \u201cfood problems,\u201d is marrying a loser, is dead from the waist down, should have her hair straightened because another bridesmaid preferred by the bride also has curly hair, and has to be reminded to dress properly for the shower on Saturday to head off her turning up in shorts and a dirty T-shirt. The letter wasn\u2019t so much an \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding and here\u2019s how I want to run it\u201d missive as it was a bashing of one girl. Some mailings identified the bridezilla in question, so we asked her about it. She replied that while she\u2019d been made the goat of this affair, she hadn\u2019t written the letter; the piece had been the work of a disgruntled ex-boyfriend of Addie\u2019s. This fellow had somehow gained access to Addie\u2019s e-mail account, fabricated a letter supposedly written by the bride, and propagated it as if it were something Addie had received and was now forwarding to others. In this way, everyone in Addie\u2019s address book got to see all the little digs at her. Is this a reasonable scenario? In an oddball way it is \u2014 it certainly better explains the \u201cAddie bashing\u201d element of the letter than does the \u201cbitchy bride\u201d construct. Bridezillas are generally far too lost in what\u2019s going on with them to spare much attention for any member of the wedding party other than themselves. A true bridezilla would barely recognize that her bridesmaids had lives outside of the wedding, let alone be capable of diverting the focus of attention from herself to any of them. Jenny\u2019s explanation may be plausible, but since we can\u2019t prove the story one way or the other, we\u2019ll leave this one marked as \u201cUndetermined.\u201d The letter in question appeared in the May 2002 issue of Cosmopolitan as a sidebar to a larger article about bridezillas. All the names were changed once again. The current bridezilla tale echoes an older e-mail similarly transmitted across the Internet in 1999. Please note that the claims of this letter\u2019s having been penned in all seriousness by a real bride have not been substantiated, but the piece did run in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1991. Harper\u2019s presented it as: \u201cFrom a letter sent by a Youngstown, Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers in 1976. Since then, copies of the six-page, single-spaced letter have been circulating nationally among engaged and newlywed couples.\u201d EDITORS NOTE: This is an actual 1976 letter from a Youngstown,Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers. Read it and count your blessings. (FROM HARPER\u2019S MAGAZINE)Dear Bridal Party: From time to time I will be dropping everyone a line or two to keep each of you informed about how the wedding plans are progressing so that no one thinks I have forgotten them and no one is in the dark. Bridesmaids: Each bridesmaid will receive her dress via mail from Priscilla of Boston sometime in January. This will give each of you enough time to have the dress \u201cprofessionally\u201d altered if need be. The dresses are chiffon \u201cPriscilla\u201d dresses and can be worn after the wedding. The right shoulder is bare and there is no sleeve on the left arm. Each has its own cape, which goes almost to the floor. The two matrons of honor will be in silver and the four bridesmaids in peppermint green. As of this date, I have not decided whether the two in silver will wear green gloves and the four in green silver gloves, but long gloves will be worn. I strongly suggest that each person shops now for the typical cloth \u201cclosed-toe\u201d shoe. Keep the heel size reasonable \u2013 of course, no platforms of any kind. Anyone having trouble with their legs should wear support hose. Ushers: Each usher will be dressed identically to the groom, best man, and the head groomsman: black tails. Be sure you have black silk socks and black dress shoes polished to a high shine. Reception Rehearsal: On Saturday afternoon (early) we will go to Powers Auditorium to practice for the reception that night after the wedding ceremony. Why? Well, there is a long staircase at the auditorium that will be put to full use: Each bridal-party couple will be introduced separately and will proceed down the first half of the staircase (accompanied by music). Upon reaching the platform in the middle of the stairs, the girl will be required to \u201cswirl\u201d from the right side of the steps and move to the left side, and her partner (an usher) will move to the right; then they will proceed down the second half of the stairs and take their positions for the Bridal Dance. Dancing: I will try to find a choreographer to help with the Bridal Dance \u2014 but each person can please do his or her part by learning to waltz correctly in three-quarter time. Now, when I say waltz, I do not in any way mean two steps here and two steps there, always standing in one spot. When we waltz it will be to \u201cTales of the Vienna Woods.\u201d Each usher will be twirling his partner while moving in a large circle and maintaining even spacing between each couple. Turn on some old-time movies and you can see how it is supposed to be done. But, PLEASE, PLEASE, practice now! Suggestion: Go take dancing lessons!! That\u2019s what we have to do!! Also, there will be some polkas, the Charleston, jitterbug, and others. These are not \u201crequired\u201d dances. There will not be any up-to-date dances. I personally dislike them and think they look terrible-they simply are not dances, in my estimation. Photographs: There will be plenty. First and foremost, there will be \u201csound motion pictures\u201d taken throughout the wedding ceremony, during the Bridal Dance, and while each bridal-party couple walks down the steps at the reception. Flash pictures will be taken in the church ONLY until my father and I arrive at the altar-after that there will be NO flash pictures; the official photographer will be taking time exposures. I believe it is the height of ill manners for any guest to leave his or her seat and proceed to the altar to take pictures. Dress Requirements: Makeup \u2014 It is requested that you wear a little more than usual because of the photographs and the movie pictures. Any ladies with short eyelashes are requested to wear either false eyelashes or go to a beauty parlor and have false eyelashes put in one by one. The matrons of honor wearing the silver dresses must have a lot of pink in their makeup. That is straight from Priscilla. Be sure that each of the four other bridesmaids has green eyeshadow and that every one wears blusher, powder, eyebrow pencil, foundation, lipstick, and mascara \u2014 the works!! There will be two experts in the field of makeup to help anyone who needs it or wants it. As for the men, ho, ho, you will have your turn also. If you have a shiny face, be sure to use some of your wife\u2019s face powder to take the shine away. For the wives and husbands of those who are in the wedding party: Ladies-the color of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses has been stated, and all that I ask is that your dress be a color that will not contrast with the peppermint green, that it is of full length, and fairly simple in line. Also, please do not wear an extensive amount of jewelry, as the bridesmaids will possibly wear only small pearl earrings. Be sure each of you has gloves. You need wear nothing in your hair. Men \u2014 Amy Vanderbilt\u2019s book on etiquette says that anyone receiving a formal invitation is to wear \u201cblack tie,\u201d which means tuxedo. Now, this could get rather touchy, so I will put it this way: If you do not wish to wear a tux, or do not wish to take on the expense of renting one, it will be perfectly fine to wear a \u201cblack\u201d suit, white shirt with French cuffs, black silk socks, black shoes, and a black-and-silver tie. I hope this doesn\u2019t inconvenience too many, but I would hate to look at color pictures of the head table and see some men in black tails and others in brown or blue suits!! Children at the Wedding or Reception: It is my wish, and also Z.\u2019s [the fianc\u00e9], that there be no children at the wedding ceremony or at the reception. For purposes of clarification, a child is anyone eighteen years or younger. There are many reasons for this request, but the best is the simple fact that I don\u2019t have the money to invite children who only pick at their food, cry, run around, etc. One friend of mine, who married about a year ago, says that when she got her wedding pictures back, there wasn\u2019t one that didn\u2019t have a kid in it and she was disgusted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, children are great. But there is a time and a place for them and this isn\u2019t it. This is an adult, ultra-formal affair and I want to keep it that way. One point of etiquette: When a formal invitation is sent out with Mr. and Mrs. Paul J. Smith on the outside envelope and Mr. and Mrs. Smith on the inside envelope, that is exactly what it means \u2014 only Mr. and Mrs. Smith are being invited and no one else; no others in the family, no guests who might be visiting at the time, etc. If asked about guests, you can \u201cdiplomatically\u201d pass this on. I know it sounds like I am being a real fusspot, but I would hate to tell each of you what the cost is per person just for the reception alone. I\u2019m doing this for my friends and relatives, for all of us to have a good time, but since there are only so many hours in the day, and I already have three jobs, and I am not a Vanderbilt, some lines must be drawn, and I hope everyone understands. I\u2019ve never wanted a small country-type wedding \u2014 Z. says this is no wedding but rather a coronation!! Well, not quite. But it sure has been fun so far, and I just cannot wait for everyone to arrive and for all our friends and relatives to have one great, fabulous night. Everyone think positive and keep your fingers crossed. Pray \u2014 that will bring more help. Won\u2019t each of you come with Z. and me to fantasyland \u2014 a place where dreams come true and fun abounds for everyone? Where the bride is Cinderella and the groom is Cinderfella for an evening. You are going to attend a ball at \u201cBuckingham Palace\u201d (pretend) and the King and Queen have invited only \u201croyalty\u201d \u2014 YOU! This will be a time to remember when you were courting the person to whom you are now married-a time to take a second honeymoon. We want everyone to be as happy as we are and to rekindle (add extra \u201cfire\u201d to) their own marriages. If you have a happy marriage now (which I know you all do), we expect the Palace to be really electrified with all that LOVE. May your every dream come true!","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4864}
{"claim_id":"34436","hypothesis":"A blow to the testicles can kill a man.","explanation_1":"While there have been cases in both the media and the scientific literature that report a connection between testicular trauma and fatalities, these case reports are speculative, sparse, and do not provide enough information to confidently demonstrate the mechanisms hypothesized behind them. A kick in the balls may lead to serious complications, but most urologists agree that death is not one of them.","premise":"Kicking, punching, or squeezing testicles has long been prized as an effective means to briefly incapacitate men, as it brings about a powerful full-body pain. The reasons for such a blow\u2019s power stems from the lack of protection the testes receive from the scrotum, the high concentration of pain receptors called nociceptors surrounding them, and the myriad interconnections between testicular nerves and organs throughout your body. The pain, medically called\u00a0\u201cblunt scrotal trauma,\u201d typically subsides without incident. However, more serious complications can arise with enough force. Have such injuries resulted in death? Potentially, though most agree that other exacerbating factors have to be considered in addition to the testicular trauma. Perhaps one the earliest purported cases of death resulting from injury to the testicle was found in a brief but terrifying case report\u00a0from 1843,\u00a0which reads: In some parts of Germany a barbarous custom exists, in cases of quarrel, of violently compressing the testicles. M. Schlesier, of Peitz, relates a case of sudden death from this species of injury. The patient fell to the ground, was seized with violent convulsions, and died in a few minutes. Without further information, it is impossible to say what exactly happened in that specific incident. The reported heart attack suffered by thirteen-year-old boy whose testicles were squeezed as part of a schoolyard prank in 2014, however, may be illustrative of how (under rare and specific extenuating circumstances) stress from that kind of trauma could result in an immediate reaction similar to the 19th-century German account. Speaking to Vice News about the\u00a02014 incident, Dr. Marc Bjurlin, a clinical instructor in Urologic Oncology at New York University, said that he can \u201conly speculate\u201d that the teenager had a hidden condition: \u201cIf that\u2019s true in the case, I suspect the boy had an underlying etiology and that the scrotal injury, perhaps from the pain, resulted in a vasovagal response which may have lowered his blood pressure and exacerbated a cardiac etiology,\u201d Bjurlin said. The sheer pain response from having one\u2019s testicles yanked is more than enough to exacerbate any number of underlying conditions, he said. A 2008\u00a0case report of a different thirteen-year-old who had been kicked in the groin during a football game\u00a0describes how he came down with a life-threatening, infection-mimicking condition called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) after the trauma. This case report concluded that death from testicular trauma is a possibility that must be considered: In our case, the patient initially presented with a minor scrotal injury; swelling and pain without ecchymosis were the only symptoms. Then, without evidence of infection, he gradually progressed to a life-threatening condition, unresponsive to empiric antibiotics and standard fluid resuscitation. Now recovered, the patient continues to be monitored for any long-term consequences of his injury. Initially patients with acute scrotal pain are told to look for signs of injury and infection, but they should also be aware of the signs of sepsis and SIRS. Although rare, death is no longer beyond the realm of consequences from testicular injury and physicians must be prepared to deliver appropriate care. SIRS was, additionally, blamed for the death of an eighteen-year-old male in India who injured himself riding a bicycle: Few cases of acute scrotal pain might lead to Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which is a life threatening condition. We report a case of an 18 year old boy who sustained testicular trauma while riding a bicycle and two months post trauma developed severe pain in left inguino-scrotal region, fever and subsequently died. The authors intend to report this unusual case as cases of testicular trauma resulting in shock and SIRS have been reported in literature but were unable to find cases of death occurring due to SIRS. Outside these rare (and still somewhat ill-defined) examples, the most plausible complications from testicular trauma are generally not life-threatening, though some (most notably trauma-induced testicular torsion) can lead to a loss of fertility or even the removal of a testicle if not properly treated. A 2004 consensus paper in BJU International outlined the potential injuries as a result of testicular trauma: Blunt trauma may cause local haematoma, ecchymosis of the scrotum, or injuries to the testicle, epididymis or spermatic cord. In testicular rupture the tunica albuginea is disrupted, while in intratesticular haematoma the tunica albuginea remains intact. Haematoceles, in which blood accumulates in the space between the tunica albuginea and tunica vaginalis, and hydroceles, can be the result of trauma. Traumatically induced testicular torsion is another well recognized entity.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":5071}
{"claim_id":"34683","hypothesis":"An angry mother delivered a scathing response to school officials after her daughter was punished for punching a classmate who snapped her ","explanation_1":"Since this story does not contain any specific details about where or when it happened or who was involved, it is impossible to verify. But since the editors at Not Always Learning strive to only publish stories based on factual events, we\u2019ll concede that somewhere at some school at some time some girl hit some boy after some boy snapped some girl\u2019s bra. Possibly.","premise":"On 19 February 2015, a user-submitted story about a mother\u2019s angry response to her daughter\u2019s being punished for punching a male classmate who snapped her bra was published on the website Not Always Learning. The story, titled \u201cWas Bra-ced for a Different Reaction,\u201d reported that a female student (identified only as \u201cdaughter\u201d) was about to be punished for hitting a male student (identified only as \u201cboy\u201d) before her mother stepped in and explained to the teacher that the school should be punishing \u201cboy\u201d instead of \u201cdaughter\u201d since \u201cboy\u201d was the one who had sexually assaulted \u201cdaughter\u201d when he snapped her bra:  (I\u2019m an A&E nurse. We\u2019re not allowed [to keep] our phones on us; they\u2019re to be kept in our lockers. A call comes into hospital reception on a private line for me.) Phone: \u201cThis is [Teacher] from [School]. There\u2019s been an incident involving [Daughter]. We need you to come in.\u201d Me: \u201cIs she ill or injured? Can it wait until my shift is over in two hours?\u201d Phone: \u201c[Daughter] has struck another pupil. We\u2019ve been trying to call you for 45 minutes. It really is very serious.\u201d (I go to the school and am ushered into the head\u2019s office. I see my daughter, her head of year, a male teacher, the headmaster, a boy with blood around his nose and a red face, and his parents.) Head: \u201cMrs. [My Name], how kind of you to FINALLY join us!\u201d Me: \u201cYeah, things get busy in A&E. I\u2019ve spent the last hour administering over 40 stitches to a seven-year-old who was beaten by his mother with a metal ladle and then I had to deal with the police regarding the matter. Sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d (After watching him try to not act embarrassed, he tells me what has happened. The boy had twanged my daughter\u2019s bra and she had punched him in the face twice. I got the impression they were more angry with my daughter than the boy.) The details of the above-quoted story are impossible to verify since all names and locations have been redacted. Without this information we have to rely on the source, the content of the article, and basic intuition. While Not Always Learning publishes user-submitted stories that \u201care based on actual, real events,\u201d the FAQ section explains that some stories are changed from second-hand tales to first-person accounts for dramatic effect:  Sometimes we will need to edit a story slightly to make it suitable for publication. Scene-setting is great, but extraneous detail may need to be cut down a little. Your submission might explain that this didn\u2019t happen to you but to your classmate\/colleague\/friend, but the audience doesn\u2019t need to know that. Don\u2019t worry, we still aim to keep the spirit of the story alive and ensure it remains as hilarious as ever! The stories published on Not Always Learning are user-submitted anecdotes meant to entertain readers. While the editors supposedly endeavor to ensure stories are based on real events, an amusing story clearly takes precedence over a factual one. Which brings us back to the content of \u201cWas Bra-ced for a Different Reaction.\u201d The story is filled with unnecessary detail to make the mother character the only credible voice; for instance, the story gives plenty of detail about the mother\u2019s heroic work in the A&E (accident and emergency room), while the other characters are painted as ignorant and incompetent:  Me: \u201cOh. And you want to know if I\u2019m going to press charges against him for sexually assaulting my daughter and against the school for allowing him to do it?\u201d (They all get jittery when I mention sexual assault and start speaking at once.) Teacher: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was that serious.\u201d Head Of Year: \u201cLet\u2019s not over-react.\u201d Head: \u201cI think you\u2019re missing the point.\u201d (The boy\u2019s mother then starts crying. I turn to my daughter to find out what happened.) Daughter: \u201cHe kept pinging my bra. I asked him to stop but he didn\u2019t, so I told Mr. [Teacher]. He told me to \u2018ignore it.\u2019 [Boy] did it again and undid my bra so I hit him. Then he stopped.\u201d (I turn to the teacher.) Me: \u201cYou let him do this? Why didn\u2019t you stop him? Come over here and let me touch the front of your trousers.\u201d Teacher: \u201cWhat?! No!\u201d Me: \u201cDoes that seem inappropriate to you? Why don\u2019t you go and pull on Mrs. [Head Of Year]\u2019s bra right now. See how fun it is for her. Or on that boy\u2019s mum\u2019s bra. Or mine. You think just because they\u2019re kids it\u2019s fun?\u201d  The mother\u2019s quick retorts also seem implausible. The story depicts a very frustrating situation, yet the mother manages to find the perfect words at every turn. While this is possible, it seems more likely that the story was written after the incident as the writer recalled exactly what she should have said. There\u2019s no English word for this concept: the French use the term \u201cesprit de l\u2019escalier,\u201d the Germans know it as treppenwitz, and fans of Seinfeld call it the Jerk Store Paradox. The story concludes with a final speech about sexual assault from this enraged mother as she scolds the teacher and the headmaster, threatens \u201cboy,\u201d and takes \u201cdaughter\u201d out of the office:  Head: \u201cMrs. [My Name]. With all due respect, [Daughter] still beat another child.\u201d Me: \u201cNo. She defended herself against a sexual attack from another pupil. Look at them; he\u2019s nearly 6 feet and 11 or 12 stone. She\u2019s 5 feet and 6 stone. He\u2019s a foot taller than her and twice as heavy. How many times should she have let him touch her? If the person who was supposed to help and protect her in a classroom couldn\u2019t be bothered what should she have done? He pulled her bra so hard it came undone.\u201d (The boy\u2019s mum is still crying and his dad looks both angry and embarrassed. The teacher won\u2019t make eye contact with me. I look at the headmaster.) Me: \u201cI\u2019m taking her home. I think the boy has learnt his lesson. And I hope nothing like this ever happens again, not only to [Daughter], but to any other girl at this school. You wouldn\u2019t let him do it to a member of staff so what makes you think he can do it to a girl of 15 is beyond me. I will be reporting this to the governors. And if you\u2013\u201d *turning to the boy* \u201c\u2013EVER touch my daughter again I WILL have you arrested for sexual assault. Do you understand me?\u201d (I was so angry I gathered my daughter\u2019s things and left. I reported it to the Board of Governors, several of whom I know from Church (it\u2019s a Catholic school), and was assured it would be strongly dealt with. I also reported it to OFSTED (Government-run school monitoring) and they were equally as horrified and assured me they would contact the school. My daughter was put into a different class for that subject, away from the teacher and the boy.)","label":1,"__index_level_0__":7162}
{"claim_id":"21407","hypothesis":"\"Mary Taylor Says that even if you have no children, \"\"under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it.\"","explanation_1":"Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor says 'Obamacare' would require purchase of unnecessary insurance","premise":"\"Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor also heads the state Department of Insurance. She makes no secret of her dislike for what she derisively calls \"\"Obamacare,\"\" the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In June, Taylor wrote a guest column for newspapers in which she said, \"\"I will do everything I can to protect Ohio\u2019s citizens and job creators from this catastrophic law.\"\" She followed it by giving a speech with a similar theme. In another guest column for newspapers that was posted Sept. 8 to the Department of Insurance website, Taylor says the health care law will limit choice and increase cost for consumers. \"\"The law\u2019s heavy-handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want,\"\" she wrote. \"\"Say for example, you do not have any children. Under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it. \"\"Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach. By requiring consumers to buy services they do not want or need, costs will rise significantly.\"\" That got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention. Would consumers really be forced to buy unnecessary coverage, like pediatric, maternity and newborn care for people with no children? We asked Taylor's office for support. We were referred to Section 1302 of the Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. \"\"It addresses the essential health benefits,\"\" a spokesman for Taylor said. We read Section 1302, and it seemed to bear out Taylor's assertion. But we were frankly confused by the wording, and we turned for guidance to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source on health care issues. \"\"It is true that this (pediatric, maternity and newborn care) is covered as part of the essential benefits package,\"\" a spokesman told us. \"\"The law does mandate that insurance.\"\" But the spokesman added more: Current employer-provided insurance plans \"\"may include coverage you will never use or need, such as maternity care for a man or prostate cancer coverage for women.\"\" Wanting further explanation, we talked with Neera Tanden, who worked on the health care legislation as senior advisor for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services. She is currently CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \"\"Ninety percent of all plans cover everything described in the bill as 'essential health benefits package,\"\" she said. \"\"People are paying for all those benefits today. We all pay for things we never use. It is the nature of insurance.\"\" Individual policies are usually more expensive, offer fewer benefits and are less regulated than group plans, she said, noting that Section 1302 of the health care act says that the scope of the package should equal the scope of benefits \"\"under a typical employer plan.\"\" The act also bans exclusions for \"\"preexisting conditions\"\" that exclusively or primarily affect women and ends the practice of charging women higher premiums than men, she said. \"\"The thrust of (Taylor's) case is there should be no requirements on what insurance companies offer,\"\" Tanden said. Wanting the perspective of an authority without a dog in the political fight, we turned to J.B. Silvers at Case Western Reserve University. He is professor of health care finance and professor of banking and finance at the Weatherhead School of Management, faculty director of the Health Systems Management Center and holds a joint appointment in the School of Medicine. He also is former CEO of a health plan and insurance company. Silvers said the health care plan \"\"makes the playing field level\"\" by setting a standard for benefit packages. \"\"It is true you could buy some sort of stripped-down policy,\"\" he said, but such plans are \"\"almost universally a bad deal\"\" with higher costs. Normally, he said, a company negotiates coverage for employees, and \"\"wouldn't offer one plan for single males and another for people with families.\"\" What does that say about the accuracy of Taylor's statement? \"\"It's irrelevant,\"\" Silvers said. \"\"It's a silly argument, frankly. Insurance by definition includes things you don't think you need.\"\" What it means to us is that Taylor, the top official at the state department that oversees insurance, was accurate in describing provisions of what she calls Obamacare. But it is misleading to imply that health insurance policies are purchased a la carte, that such purchasing would reduce costs to consumers, and that the \"\"essential benefits package\"\" represents a departure from current group plans. And when a statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, it rates  on the Truth-O-Meter.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6848}
{"claim_id":"26777","hypothesis":"The mortality rate for the flu is \u201cright around\u201d that of the new coronavirus: \u201cIt\u2019s right around 2%.\u201d","explanation_1":"\"The mortality rate for the flu is considered by most experts to be about 0.1%. That's \"\"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure,\"\" said\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. Although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually. Estimates for the mortality rate for coronavirus are currently around 2%, but this number could change depending on how cases are diagnosed.\"","premise":"\"During a Senate appropriations Feb. 25 subcommittee hearing, Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, said the U.S. flu mortality rate was about the same as the current estimated global mortality rate of the coronavirus outbreak. He made this statement during an exchange with Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) regarding what the acting secretary knew about the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. This C-SPAN video shows the full discussion between the two. Kennedy first asked what the worldwide mortality rate for coronavirus is, to which Wolf responded, that it was \"\"under 2%\"\" but that he would need to check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual figure and that \"\"it changes daily.\"\" The Louisiana senator then asked, \"\"What\u2019s the mortality rate for influenza over, say, the last 10 years in America?\"\" Wolf answered: \"\"It\u2019s also right around that percentage as well. I don\u2019t have that offhand, but it\u2019s right around 2% as well.\"\" We asked the Department of Homeland Security where Wolf\u2019s figure came from. A DHS spokesperson said in an email, \"\"As the acting secretary said in his hearing, he did not have that information on hand and refers to Health and Human Services -- the federal agency in charge of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus response.\"\" The comparison of coronavirus to flu in terms of mortality rates seemed like an important mechanism to understanding the growing concern about the reach of coronavirus, so we decided to dig deeper to find out if these statistics hold up. We also asked experts to explain what the numbers mean in terms of risk. Digging into mortality rate numbers The CDC directed us to its online influenza resources and referred us to the World Health Organization for more information on coronavirus. Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, called it \"\"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.\"\" It\u2019s important to note, that although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually. Now, for coronavirus. According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. (These numbers reflect the information available at the time of the secretary\u2019s testimony.) But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus. \"\"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\"\" said Mores. \"\"They have changed their case definitions multiple times. It\u2019s murky what has gone into the case count and who has gone into being counted on cases.\"\" The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%. Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%. Right now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. \"\"We don\u2019t have any evidence to that being the case,\"\" said Osterholm. Mores said U.S. health officials just don\u2019t have enough information to know whether the two mortality rates are similar. Understanding this comparison would offer a means to better understand the severity of the coronavirus. It could also help in educating the public about the novel illness. \"\"Until we can gain our own experience with this virus, it\u2019s going to be pretty squishy. So, all the numbers that you have come across here are within the range of possibility,\"\" he said. \"\"Absolutely, the hope is we will end up with something similar to the flu, but we just don\u2019t know yet.\"\" Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"\"confirmed cases.\"\" Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down. This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis. One key difference between the flu and the coronavirus illness, Osterholm cautioned, is that, with the flu, the population has a partially built up immunity, whether through receiving flu shots or already having been exposed to the illness. Mores concurred. \"\"You know, the risk is this: We have a brand-new virus in a completely naive population on Earth, we\u2019re all susceptible to it. Everyone is potentially infectable with this virus,\"\" he said. \"\"Even with a high transmission rate and the low case fatality rate, that still becomes a massive number of ill and fatal cases.\"\" Our ruling There are two ways to parse out this claim: First, is it true that the average U.S. mortality rate for flu is 2%? That\u2019s not true, according to data from the CDC and exchanges with multiple global health experts. On average, the flu mortality rate during the past 10 years has been 0.1%. In addition, Wolf and a DHS spokesperson admitted that the acting secretary did not have the statistics in front of him when he answered questions at the hearing about the mortality rates. Second, is it true the COVID-19 mortality rate is similar to the flu mortality rate? Wolf is also wrong on that account, based on the limited information currently known about the coronavirus. Recent data from the Chinese government set the COVID-19 mortality rate at 2.3%. That\u2019s vastly different from the flu\u2019s mortality rate of 0.1%. Experts also said that while it\u2019s possible the mortality rate from the new virus could come close to the flu\u2019s mortality rate eventually \u2015 if the case definition of coronavirus is expanded -- it\u2019s too soon to make that assumption with the limited information available.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":112}
{"claim_id":"11248","hypothesis":"Acupuncture Eases Depression in Pregnancy","explanation_1":"This story reports on a small, randomized trial evaluating acupuncture for the treatment of depression in pregnant women. This story has numerous flaws, the biggest of which was relying heavily on the press release. By relying on a news release for quotes, this story missed some of the caveats and words of caution from researchers and independent experts that we saw in other stories.","premise":"There was no discussion regarding the cost of acupuncture, a particularly important omission since acupuncture is not covered by all insurance companies. The story tells the us that acupuncture significantly improved symptoms compared to the other treatment groups, but then it states that there was no difference in remission rates. A discussion on what this mixed outcome means would have been\u00a0useful. While acupuncture is generally safe, the story should have mentioned that 21 women in the study reported transient pain at the site of needle insertion and 1 woman experienced bleeding. The story did a nice job describing the study methods, pointing out that the patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group and that the people measuring their outcome were not aware which treatment the patients were receiving. These are all signs of a rigorous study design, but the story does not tell the reader why these methods are so\u00a0important. The story also should have noted that a study with 150 participants is still relatively small. This story indicates that 14% of pregnant women may suffer from depression; however, the writer might have also noted that 3-5% of pregnant women have actually been diagnosed. No independent experts were interviewed for this story.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":8971}
{"claim_id":"38717","hypothesis":" There\u2019s a Kroger 40% off coupon making the rounds on Facebook that sounds too good to be true. ","explanation_1":"A major wildfire threatened thousands of homes and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Los Angeles on Wednesday as the fiercest Santa Ana winds yet lashed Southern California, forcing meteorologists to create new alert levels to warn of the danger.","premise":"The blaze erupted early on Wednesday morning in Simi Valley, northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, and by nightfall had charred 1,300 acres (526 hectares) as crews fought to protect the Reagan library and some 7,000 homes in the path of the flames. The Easy Fire, which forced 26,000 people to flee, broke out some 30 miles (48 km) from a separate conflagration burning in shrub-covered hills near the Getty Center museum that has displaced thousands of residents from some of the city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. The Getty museum houses a collection that includes paintings by Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Manet, ancient Greek statues and an expansive array of manuscripts. The Reagan Library, Getty Center and Getty Villa in Malibu were all forced to close due to the flames and thick clouds of smoke, although all three facilities were said to be out of imminent danger by evening. \u201cThe dedication of our staff and the professionalism of our region\u2019s first responders has been nothing short of heroic,\u201d  Getty president Jim Cuno said in a statement posted on the center\u2019s website. The Santa Ana winds were blamed for a string of fire outbreaks across Southern California. In Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, a wind-driven brush fire swiftly blackened 250 acres (101 hectares), forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people from two mobile home parks and a nursing home, county fire spokesman Rob Roseen said. Weather conditions were at their worst, with fierce winds hurling burning embers through the air across bone-dry brush to ignite spot fires. \u201cThe fire outflanked us very rapidly today, pushed by those 40- to 50-mile-per-hour (40- to 80 km per hour) winds,\u201d Ventura County Fire Department assistant chief Chad Cook told reporters. \u201cWe did experience gusts up to 65 miles per hour (105 kph) this morning, which made long-range spotting very, very dangerous.\u201d  He said erratic, high winds also forced intermittent grounding of firefighting aircraft through the day. The National Weather Service issued an unprecedented \u201cextreme red flag\u201d warning for wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties ahead of two days of intense, dry wind gusts that were forecast to reach near-hurricane force. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen us use this warning,\u201d forecaster Marc Chenard said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d   Statewide, the weather service issued alerts for \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d fire hazards covering more than 34,000 square miles (88,000 square km), encompassing some 21 million people. Power was cut off to nearly 400,000 homes and businesses statewide on Wednesday as a precaution by the state\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp (PCG.N), and other utilities. The so-called Easy fire in Simi Valley broke out just before dawn off a road named Easy Street, sending a wall of flames racing across scrub-covered slopes at the edge of the hilltop Reagan Library, which houses the late president\u2019s archives and memorabilia. Pre-positioned strike teams of firefighters, backed by water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers dumping payloads of fire retardant, swarmed the area as flames closed in on the library campus. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded. It\u2019s a scary situation. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get on top of it,\u201d John Heubusch, the library\u2019s executive director, said in an interview with KNX radio in Los Angeles during the firefight. \u201cIt\u2019s as close as it gets.\u201d  By late morning, emergency crews had largely subdued flames, and the fire moved off in other directions. The blaze prompted public schools and at least five college campuses in the area to cancel classes for the day. Health authorities were handing out disposable air filter masks to members of the public at five cites around the county. On nearby ranches, residents in the protective face masks scrambled to coax nervous horses and other livestock into trailers to drive them to safety. \u201cAs long as we get up, get out of here, get the car moving, everything else can be replaced in theory so you know breathing at the end of the day is better than not breathing at the end of the day,\u201d resident David Pollack told Reuters. The Santa Ana winds are a regional weather phenomenon that sends gusts westward off the desert to the east, through mountain passes toward the coast. They were forecast to reach sustained speeds of 50 to 70 mph (80 to 110 kph) on Wednesday and Thursday. Investigators say the Getty fire was likely caused by a broken tree branch blown into power lines during high winds on Monday morning. It spread, consuming 745 acres (300 hectares) by Wednesday morning, with about a quarter contained by firefighters. At least 12 homes have been destroyed. In northern California, firefighters struggled for a sixth day against the 76,000-acre (30,760-hectare) Kincade fire in Sonoma County\u2019s wine country. That blaze has destroyed at least 189 homes and other structures but was listed as 30 percent contained on Wednesday. PG&E acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire started near a damaged transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line on that tower malfunctioned. The company filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018. As many as 190,000 people were displaced at the height of the Kincade fire, but some evacuations have since been lifted.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6151}

What's false: Michelangelo's \"\"David,\"\" and replicas of it, have been covered up, and been the subject of censorship campaigns, ever since the statue was first unveiled in Florence in the early 16th century. The show's writers didn't so much \"\"predict\"\" such campaigns, as satirize previous ones, which happened to be replicated in the years since the episode aired.\"","premise":"Several times in recent years, various websites and online \u201clisticles\u201d have claimed that, among other uncanny predictions, the Simpsons once pre-empted the real-life censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d statue. In particular, in 2017 the comedian and former NFL punter Pat McAfee devoted a five-minute segment on his podcast to reviewing and promoting various claimed instances where the classic animated sitcom was remarkably prescient about events that were yet to happen. He said: \u201cThe censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s David: 1990 [it occurred on the show], 2016 it happened.\u201d Likewise, in a 2018 article listing more than 30 occasions when \u201creal life has imitated \u2018The Simpsons,'\u201d the Daily Telegraph wrote: Itchy and Scratchy also featured heavily in the 1990 episode Itchy and Scratchy and Marge, in which Marge led a censorship campaign, horrified by the show\u2019s violence. She later realised the censorship had gone too far, after Michelangelo\u2019s David was taken to a Springfield museum, and local citizens protested against the statue\u2019s nudity. In 2001, a Florida-based shop put a replica of Michelangelo\u2019s David outside its front door. A handful of citizens objected to the \u201cindecent\u201d statue and successfully campaigned to have David\u2019s private parts covered with a cloth. More recently, in 2014, an elderly British couple, Clive and Joan Burgess, received complaints from neighbours and faced an intervention from their local council, after they placed a replica of the statue in their front garden. In May 2019, Business Insider published a list of \u201c18 Times \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Accurately Predicted the Future,\u201d including the bowdlerization of \u201cDavid\u201d: \u201cAn episode from 1990 titled \u2018Itchy and Scratchy and Marge\u2019 showed Springfieldians protesting against Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David being exhibited in the local museum, calling the artwork obscene for its nudity. The satire of censorship came true in July 2016, when Russian campaigners voted on whether to clothe a copy of the Renaissance statue that had been set up in central St. Petersburg.\u201d The basic facts, dates, and descriptions of events laid out in these articles and in McAfee\u2019s podcast were accurate. The episode in question was Season 2, Episode 9, \u201cItchy and Scratchy and Marge,\u201d and it did indeed first air on Dec. 20, 1990. In the episode, Marge rails against the ultra-violence and obscenity of the \u201cItchy and Scratchy Show,\u201d and leads a campaign of censorship against the cartoon. The writers brilliantly examine and expose the relativity and subjectivity of taste, obscenity, and moral standards in culture, and Marge\u2019s crusade spirals out of control, culminating in a local group picketing Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d for its nudity. It\u2019s also true that, as McAfee alluded to, a campaign took place in the Russian city of St. Petersburg in 2016 that aimed to remove a replica of the statue, or cover up the male figure\u2019s genitals \u2014 not a far cry from the kind of campaign depicted in the 1990 \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode. However, the difficulty in claiming that Matt Groening and his writers \u201cpredicted\u201d the censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d lies in the fact that campaigns to cover up nude works of art in general, and \u201cDavid\u201d in particular, have existed for centuries. The prevalence of fig leafs on classical statues is testament to that, as Alexxa Gotthardt wrote for the website Artsy in 2018: Take Michelangelo\u2019s famous sculpture \u201cDavid\u201d (1501\u201304), a muscular, starkly naked depiction of its namesake biblical hero. The work scandalized the artist\u2019s fellow Florentines and the Catholic clergy when unveiled in Florence\u2019s Piazza della Signoria in 1504. Soon after, the figure\u2019s sculpted phallus was girdled with a garland of bronze fig leaves by authorities.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":6206}
{"claim_id":"9506","hypothesis":"Tweaking brains with \u2018smart drugs\u2019 to get ahead in Silicon Valley","explanation_1":"This story about purported brain-boosting pills would have been easier to swallow if it came with a stronger shot of skepticism. The story would have benefited greatly from at least one source who isn\u2019t involved in the cognitive-enhancement movement. It does a better job of describing the availability of these supplements and the hyper-competitive culture that feeds this emerging market. The term \u201cnootropics\u201d applies to a wide variety of substances that apparently require no safety or efficacy trials, no FDA approval, and no prescription from a doctor. As a result, media coverage is often consumers\u2019 only tool to counter the marketing hype when attempting to determine whether these products will do them good or harm, or simply waste their money. Sadly critical coverage is in short supply. Back in 2015, HealthNewsReview.org Associate Editor Kathlyn Stone wrote that nootropics were \u201cunder the radar\u201d of journalists, despite heavy marketing targeted at students and young professionals. That appears to be changing, but journalists need to be cognizant of their role as consumer watchdogs.","premise":"There\u2019s no discussion of cost. We found one drug cited in this story \u2014 piracetam \u2014 online for $39.99 for 180 capsules. For those seeking a cocktail of supposed brain boosters, startup Nootrobox charges $135 for \u201call the nootropics you need to enhance your cognitive state for one month.\u201d The company explains: \u201cCognitive performance is an active, long-term investment.\u201d (Notably, piracetam isn\u2019t on Nootrobox\u2019s ingredient list. For more on that, read the section on availability.) The story doesn\u2019t quantify any known benefits of these brain enhancers, for example if memory increased by a certain percent. Harms are addressed\u2013enough to be Satisfactory for this criteria. But the discussion is confusing. The story initially says nootropics have \u201csupposedly few side effects and low toxicity.\u201d Later it states: As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d In contrast, consider these unequivocal cautions in a similar Mercury News story last fall, starting in the seventh paragraph: Research into the cognitive benefits of nootropics is still in its early stages, and some experts worry about the long-term health effects of ingesting potent synthetic smart drugs, which are largely unregulated. Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said. This story falls into the trap of relying on positive anecdotes as evidence, citing an entrepreneur who \u201ccredits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees,\u201d as well as a physician who said he with experimented with piracetam and found it \u201chelpful.\u201d Also troublesome is this statement: \u201cPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities.\u201d\u00a0 Saying it\u2019s \u201cwell studied\u201d in the same sentence as giving purported benefits is confusing and may lead readers to assume incorrectly that these benefits were proven in studies. Lastly, the story quotes advocates of fasting without cautioning that what works in mice may not apply to humans. Comments Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging: \u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases.\u201d In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cconclusive evidence from animal studies.\u201d To its credit, the story does eventually\u2013but very briefly\u2013explore the quality of the evidence, mainly via\u00a0this comment from Duke University Health System researcher Murali Doraiswamy: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence.\u201d There\u2019s no outright disease-mongering here, but the preposterous quote that it is \u201cthe few who are getting ahead who are using supplements\u201d should have been challenged. That makes it sounds like \u201cnormal\u201d people are in some way deficient. The story lacks comment from an independent expert who\u2019s not involved with selling, prescribing or taking nootropics or some other cognition-boosting product. The story doesn\u2019t address proven strategies to improve mental skills such as good nutrition, adequate sleep, social engagement, cognitively challenging activities, and exercise. The story does a good job here, although it injects confusion when it states that in the U.S. piracetam \u201ccan be sold only for research purposes,\u201d but later says that piracetam and similar drugs are available online. In fact, the FDA at least twice warned suppliers, in 2010 and 2012, that piracetam was classified as a drug and could not be sold as a supplement. According to online accounts, that FDA action prompted major retailers to stop carrying it, which could explain why it\u2019s not present in some products marketed as nootropics. The story also states: \u201cA number of companies now market nootropic \u2018stacks,\u2019 or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\u201d There story gives perspective, mentioning that piracetam has been around for decades, though newer formulations are on the market, and that companies have recently begun marketing \u201cstacks\u201d with multiple supplements. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":5579}
{"claim_id":"9595","hypothesis":"Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers","explanation_1":"Reducing sugar\u2014but not calories\u2014in the diets of a small group of children who have obesity led to substantial reductions in heart disease risk factors in only nine days, a new study shows. This brief New York Times Well blog post does a good\u00a0job explaining these details, including the cautionary information that the study was small and of short duration. But the cost of brevity is\u00a0that it fails\u00a0to offer readers the kinds of methodological and explanatory details that would have helped them judge the relatively cursory nature of the research. Instead, it encourages readers to view the study as part of a growing body of research by referring them to a longer and more detailed 2015 post about a study conducted by some of the same scientists. Alas, a quick look at the methodological details suggests that both studies stem from the same group of child participants. It is not unusual for a single study to generate several research articles. But one could make the argument here that holding such small studies in abeyance and waiting for the bigger picture would serve readers better. Including commentary from an independent expert also would have strengthened the post. Although we Americans cling desperately to our sugary foods, learning that reducing sugar could markedly improve our health might encourage significant behavior change in this country. There is a growing\u2013but certainly not\u00a0conclusive\u2013body of evidence that suggests there might be unique concerns with sugar beyond just its calories, such as being a possible contributor to heart disease.","premise":"The brief text reflects only on removing highly sugared foods\u00a0in the diet of children. Replacement foods used in the study were commonly available at no obvious extra cost. This short narrative does an admirable job of getting specific about physiological changes that took place in these children over the course\u00a0of nine days. However, the story should have\u00a0established what this means in terms of an outcome that someone cares about. What would be the expected reduction in risk of heart attack or stroke? How big are the changes clinically, and how do they compare with other approaches? It\u2019s probably hard to say since these are children, but then the story should acknowledge that. The study sought to hold number of calories constant in order to examine the impact of reduced sugar. While many health experts would point out that substituting pizza and bagels does not meet the criteria for an overall healthy diet, that was not a concern of this design. This was a modest study, with only 37 or 43 (the blog post indicates 37 while a UCSF\u00a0news\u00a0release indicates 43) child participants who were tracked over nine days. The reporter does label the effort \u201csmall and short-term.\u201d Calls to reduce sugar in our diets have burgeoned in recent years, and data do seem to suggest that eating less sugar is beneficial. Just how beneficial is still a matter of study. There are no independent sources\u2013the one person quoted\u00a0is study coauthor, Dr. Robert Lustig, who has a potential conflict of interest. Lustig wrote a book that\u2019s extremely critical of sugar, and has spoken of fructose as \u201cpoison.\u201d The story makes no mention of other strategies typically employed to reduce markers of heart disease, including other types of dietary changes, exercise and drugs such as statins (which are typically reserved for adults). The UCSF\u00a0news\u00a0release did include this type of information. Bagels and pizza are ubiquitous. The extent to which the research is novel is left unexplored. The blog post does reference a 2015 post about a research report that, while examining different physiological end points, reaches similar conclusions about sugar as a bad actor. The UCSF news\u00a0release provided a lot of information about this study, but the blog post\u00a0sticks with\u00a0a short summary of the\u00a0findings.

{"claim_id":"9525","hypothesis":"Cuddling Preemies Kangaroo Style Helps Into Adulthood","explanation_1":"This story reports on a 20-year follow-up study of low birth weight infants in Colombia who received continuous skin-to-skin contact with a caregiver as part of a practice known as kangaroo mother care (KMC). Researchers concluded that infants who had been randomized to receive KMC rather than staying in an incubator reaped long-lasting social and behavioral benefits such as lower mortality, lower school absenteeism and fewer behavior problems. This coverage describes both positive and negative findings of the 20-year outcomes,\u00a0which were reported in the journal Pediatrics, but it doesn\u2019t include quantified data or tap independent sources. It also misses important limitations, such as the difficulty of measuring the precise impact of a multi-faceted intervention after 20 years have gone by. It seems odd to label as an \u201cintervention\u201d something as natural as skin-to-skin contact between a mother and a baby, along with an emphasis on breastfeeding and early hospital discharge. KMC was developed in the 1970s in Bogat\u00e1, Colombia, partly in response to overtaxed neonatal care facilities. But its many demonstrated benefits \u2014 including lower mortality and infection rates, greater breastfeeding and stronger family bonding \u2014 have pushed those concepts into mainstream preemie care in countries of all income levels. The World Health Organization includes KMC in its guidelines to improve premature birth outcomes. Some 15 million babies are born too early every year, leading to nearly 1 million deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. Survivors are prone to learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. The vast majority of these at-risk infants are in developing countries where medical resources are limited. Despite some flaws, this study offers reassurance that premature babies who spend their early days with skin-to-skin will fare at least as well as adults as those who were in an incubator. Stories should not extrapolate beyond that.","premise":"The costs of this intervention or of the control, a neonatal minimal care unit in which infants remain in an incubator while they gain weight, aren\u2019t mentioned. The story states that KMC babies were 39 percent more likely to live into adulthood, but doesn\u2019t give absolute numbers to help readers judge the significance of this finding. The story also lists several other benefits without quantifying them (or even explaining what they mean in some cases), including that the babies \u201cgrew up with fewer social problems,\u201d stayed in school longer and earned more as adults. It quotes a researcher saying they \u201chad less aggressive drive and were less impulsive and hyperactive\u201d compared to babies who stayed in an incubator.\u201d There aren\u2019t any obvious harms from this intervention, although the story does note the finding that children given standard incubator care had higher math and language scores in school even though IQ levels were similar in both groups. A 2012 Cochrane review of multiple studies found no negative outcomes associated with skin-to-skin contact for healthy newborns except for one study\u2019s report of longer duration of breastfeeding in a control group. The story acknowledges KMC \u201cdidn\u2019t work miracles. Children with cerebral palsy were equally likely to have symptoms whether they had the kangaroo care or not, and more than half the people in the entire group needed glasses.\u201d But, the story should have made the point that it\u2019s difficult to connect the dots between a single intervention and outcomes 20 years down the road. In an editorial accompanying the study, Lydia Furman, MD, of University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, describes several complications with the findings. For one, she notes, KMC is a \u201cbundled intervention\u201d involving parental nurturing, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin contact, making it difficult to discern which contributed to the outcomes. She writes: Second, it is difficult to quantify and qualify parent-associated and parent-delivered interventions because all parents are different. Third, we are a full 20 years out, and \u201clife has happened,\u201d so numerous potentially unmeasured contributions to each individual child\u2019s life (and outcomes) have occurred. Furman notes that the study shows that KMC infants had some superior outcomes. \u201cYet the authors are pressed to explain the significantly higher math and language academic scores in the traditional care group. In other words, it is complicated.\u201d The story accurately states that 20 million babies are born at a low birth weight every year, according to the World Health Organization. We did take issue with this speculative quote about the behavior of the babies in the skin-to-skin group, which was featured prominently in all caps in the NBC story: \u201cTHEY EXHIBITED LESS ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR, WHICH MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH SEPARATION FROM THE MOTHER AT BIRTH.\u201d This borders on fear-mongering. For all mothers\u2013but especially moms who have premature babies and\/or complicated births\u2013having a newborn is very stressful. The looming threat that antisocial behavior is a risk the mother is specifically responsible for in these fragile days and hours may compound the\u00a0stress. The story lacked comment from independent sources. While there are some statements about KMC attributed to the World Health Organization, those statements don\u2019t address the findings of this study. An independent source likely could have provided some context and important reassurances to parents who had premature babies but either weren\u2019t offered kangaroo care or weren\u2019t able to because of birth complications, which is a growing problem in the U.S. The purpose of the study was to compare the KMC approach with a neonatal intensive care. There are no other viable alternatives to infant care that we know of. The story notes that KMC requires parents to receive adequate support and follow-up. But we would have liked to see more information, such as how widely this approach is used to treat premature infants and what some of the barriers might be in high-income countries where incubator care has been the norm. For example, how many U.S. neonatal intensive care units incorporate skin-to-skin contact in their care? Which babies in intensive care don\u2019t or can\u2019t get this kind of care? From what we could find, what makes this study notable is that it\u2019s the only 20-year follow-up for this kind of intervention. In an indirect way, the story touches upon this. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":9353}
