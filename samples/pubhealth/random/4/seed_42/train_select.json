{"claim_id":"5428","hypothesis":"Uganda: 9-year-old girl from Congo dies of Ebola.","explanation_1":"A 9-year-old Congolese girl who tested positive for Ebola in neighboring Uganda has died, Ugandan authorities said Friday, as the World Health Organization said that the outbreak has neared 3,000 cases.","premise":"The girl\u2019s body was repatriated to Congo for a funeral upon the request of her father, according to Uganda\u2019s health ministry. The girl, who was traveling with her mother, was identified at a border screening Wednesday as a possible Ebola patient and isolated. Although cases of cross-border contamination have been rare, this case highlights the risk of Ebola spreading across the border into neighboring Uganda and Rwanda. Borders in the region are often porous, and many people traveling at night use bush paths to cross over. In June, a family of Congolese with some sick family members crossed into Uganda via a bush path. Two of them later died of Ebola, and the others were transferred back to Congo. \u201cIt is critical we continue to be on high alert in high-risk areas and empower communities to be prepared in order to contain the virus,\u201d the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Uganda has had multiple outbreaks of Ebola and hemorrhagic fevers since 2000. Because the 9-year-old Ebola victim passed through an official entry point this week, Ugandan health authorities believe she had no contact with any Ugandan. But at least five other Congolese, including attendants to patients, who shared an ambulance with the sick girl have been identified by Ugandan officials as Ebola contacts. Four of them have since been taken back to Congo for vaccination and monitoring, said Joyce Moriku Kaducu, Ugandan minister of state in charge of primary health care. Ebola has killed nearly 2,000 people in eastern Congo since August 2018. The disease is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. WHO said Friday that cases have reached 3,000 in Congo, with 1,893 confirmed deaths and about 900 survivors. On average, 80 people per week are sickened by the virus, which has infected most people in Congo\u2019s North Kivu province. The Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo hasn\u2019t shown signs of slowing down despite new treatments and vaccines given to more than 200,000 people in the region and the use of two therapeutic treatments being used as part of a clinical trial. Insecurity has been one factor in a region where rebel groups have fought for control of mineral-rich lands for decades. Ebola also has spread because of mistrust by communities who have also staged attacks against health workers. Many people in eastern Congo don\u2019t trust doctors and other medics. \u201cOne year into the response, the lack of community acceptance remains the single greatest obstacle to containing the outbreak,\u201d said Bob Kitchen, Vice President of Emergencies at the International Rescue Committee. \u201cBuilding trust with the community doesn\u2019t just mean dialogue with the affected population. It means working with the community to adapt the response and address the overall needs they are facing inside and outside of the Ebola outbreak.\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will travel this weekend to Congo with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and senior officials, including Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. On Friday, he called on partners to increase their presence in the field. \u201cOur commitment to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is that we will work alongside them to stop the Ebola outbreak,\u201d Ghebreyesus said. \u201cOur commitment also means strengthening the health systems to give them all the other things they need. Building strong systems is what will protect people, communities and the world.\u201d ___ Maliro reported from Beni, Congo.

{"claim_id":"3017","hypothesis":"As wildfires get worse, smoke spreads, stokes health worries.","explanation_1":"First came the flames, a raging firestorm propelled by 50 mph (80 kph) wind gusts that incinerated Kelsey Norton\u2019s house and killed 85 people in her community.","premise":"Then came the smoke \u2014 not just from the forest but also from some 14,000 houses and their contents that burned, generating a thick plume that enshrouded portions of Northern California for weeks and left Norton gasping. And since the fire, more than a year now, it has been sickness: repeated respiratory infections that sap Norton\u2019s strength, interfere with her work and leave the 30-year-old cardiac care nurse worried about future health problems. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have cancer in my 50s because I inhaled smoke in my 30s,\u201d she said. The immediate toll of lives and property lost when a fire tore through the Sierra Nevada foothills town of Paradise, California in November 2018 is well documented. Still unknown is the long-term impact of the intense smoke exposure suffered by the tragedy\u2019s survivors and the hundreds of thousands of people living in communities downwind of the blaze. Increasingly intense wildfires are scorching forests from across the  Western U.S. to Australia  and stoking concern among residents and health professionals about long-term health impacts from smoke exposure. The issue has far-reaching implications as climate change turns some regions of the globe drier and more prone to fires that send up smoke plumes that can travel thousands of miles and affect millions of people. The unprecedented fires burning across Australia  offer the most recent example as they blanket major cities with dangerous air pollution. Smoke from those fires, which started burning in September, by this week had spread across more than 7.7 million square miles (20 million square kilometers) and drifted across the Pacific Ocean  to reach South America, according to the United Nation\u2019s meteorological agency and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. Th e fires have torched more than 2,000 houses and killed at least 26 people. Authorities ordered new evacuations in New South Wales and the neighboring state of Victoria as rising temperatures and erratic winds on Friday threatened to fan dozens of blazes still burning out of control. Both states issued hazardous air quality warnings for affected areas and said people with health problems should consider relocating until the smoke clears. Compounding the danger, experts and firefighters say, is the proliferation of construction materials and household items made from petroleum-based plastics, ranging from plumbing pipes to exterior siding. Those burn hotter and generate smoke more toxic than wood does, exposing people to numerous hazardous chemicals. Researchers and health officials are confident  more people will get sick and many will die as regions such as the U.S. West see bigger, more intense wildfires. An estimated 20,000 premature deaths now occur annually in the U.S. due to chronic wildfire smoke exposure. That\u2019s expected to double by the end of the century, according to scientists funded by NASA, as tens of millions of people get exposed to massive \u201csmoke waves\u201d emanating from blazes in Western states. But while those forecasts help illustrate the profound impacts of a warming climate, they can\u2019t predict which fires will prove deadly and which individuals will develop lung ailments or other illnesses. One of relatively few long-term studies on the issue is under way at the California National Primate Research Center. Fifty rhesus monkeys living in outdoor pens year-round were exposed to a prolonged period of wildfire smoke as infants in 2008. They\u2019ve developed lungs 20% smaller than another group of monkeys born a year later, researchers found. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest animal model to replicate what happens with kids,\u201d said Lisa Miller, the center\u2019s associate director of research. The difference first showed up when the animals were adolescents, and has continued as they\u2019ve matured. It\u2019s impossible for the untrained eye to distinguish the smoke-exposed monkeys from hundreds of others that share their pens, but Miller\u2019s team next plans to investigate how the decreased lung function affects activity levels of the monkeys. As the animals age, any diseases they develop and how they die would give clues into the fate of humans heavily exposed to smoke. Studies of wildland firefighters also give insights into the risks of smoke inhalation. They\u2019ve shown significantly higher rates of lung cancer and death from heart disease, said Michael Kleinman, who researches the health effects of air pollution and is a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Irvine. Firefighters get much higher and more frequent doses of smoke, but Kleinman said a proportional increase in illnesses could be expected among the general public exposed to wildfire smoke across California and the West. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say there will probably more effects at the long-term level,\u201d Kleinman said. \u201cEspecially if those events happened over a longer period of time or more repeatedly, there will be cumulative damage to the lung and heart which eventually will lead to chronic disease.\u201d As she fled with her boyfriend ahead of the fire that destroyed Paradise on the morning of Nov. 8, 2018, Norton said the smoke was so thick \u201cit was like midnight.\u201d A few days later, she went back to work at a hospital in Chico, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) miles from Paradise. But smoke from the still-burning fire had made it inside the facility. There weren\u2019t enough face masks to go around so Norton said she went without one for several days. Initially she felt just a bit wheezy, as she had during the last major fire in the area about a decade earlier. But two weeks later she came down with a respiratory infection that brought fever and severe congestion. When that finally cleared, she got another, then another \u2014 eight or nine infections in all over the past year. \u201cI just want to break this cycle of sickness,\u201d she said. Norton says she never smoked, nor did her parents, and never had any respiratory issues prior to the fire. She missed so much work in the months after the fire that she got a warning from a supervisor. To try to keep from getting sick, she rinses out her sinuses regularly and takes antihistamines to reduce inflammation in her airways. She also avoids large gatherings, including skipping office parties and two weddings, out of fear that she could pick up a virus. She tries to eat healthy and reduce stress by seeing a counselor. Norton has been to a pulmonologist and two ear nose and throat doctors to little avail, and has been referred to a sinus specialist at Stanford University for further testing. The pulmonologist who initially treated her, Dinesh Verma, said he sees a \u201cdirect correlation\u201d between Norton\u2019s smoke exposure and her subsequent health struggles. \u201cThe logical explanation definitely would be that intense smoke, basically chemical exposure, did damage the airways to the extent that they\u2019re now more susceptible\u201d to infection, Verma said. Verma said virtually all of his hundreds of patients from Chico and Paradise had complications after the fire that required them to be hospitalized or treated. Most had preexisting conditions such as asthma and needed only a trigger to send them into a downward spiral. Predicting what will happen with otherwise-healthy patients like Norton is more difficult, he said. Norton is among about 9,000 people who responded to a health survey as part of a long-term health study of smoke exposure in Paradise and other California communities. The work is led by researchers at the University of California, Davis, who plan to track the lung health of a small number of those respondents in coming years by measuring their breathing capacity. They\u2019re also collaborating with Williams at the primate center to see if the decline seen in the rhesus monkeys has parallels for human infants. Dr. Nicholas Kenyon, a pulmonologist involved in the effort, said determining the health effects of smoke is increasingly urgent given the region\u2019s burgeoning population and more frequent fires due to climate change. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the population affected right now, but it\u2019s not going to be isolated to us. This is going to be the entire West,\u201d Kenyon said. \u201cNobody\u2019s been really inhaling this kind of stuff from structures until now.\u201d Another participant in the UC Davis study, 64-year-old Elizabeth Watling, lives in Chico and remained there through the fire so she could look after her 94-year-old aunt. She recalls smoke so thick that it left a layer of ash all over town, gray and light as snow. The air remained heavily polluted until it rained more than two weeks later. When she gardens or does other outdoor activities, Watling wears a mask because her throat has become so easily irritated by dust. She fiddles with it often, taking the mask on and off to talk, and wonders how effective it will be since she can fit her fingers through gaps along her cheeks. The health issues Watling blames on the smoke are less severe than Norton\u2019s \u2014 a scratchy throat that won\u2019t go away, coughs that linger, shortness of breath. She expected those to go away but they haven\u2019t. Watling now figures that, given her age, she won\u2019t ever fully recover and the smoke could shave years off her life. \u201cI don\u2019t think the news is good for me,\u201d she said. ___ Follow Matthew Brown on Twitter: @MatthewBrownAP ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

{"claim_id":"5864","hypothesis":"Wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis hits home for Packers\u2019 Crosby.","explanation_1":"Mason Crosby won his competition to remain the Green Bay Packers\u2019 kicker.","premise":"His wife beat a more formidable challenger. Molly Crosby, a 32-year-old mother of five, had been dealing with bouts of coughing and congestion all summer. Some preliminary exams in Green Bay showed a spot on her right lung. That led the Crosbys to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for additional tests. A carcinoid endocrine tumor was found. The tumor isn\u2019t as dangerous as other forms of cancer but was disconcerting for an otherwise healthy, nonsmoker. \u201cWe found out the day before we reported to camp,\u201d Crosby said on Wednesday. \u201cWe were at Mayo the two or three days leading up to training camp, when they did all their scans and got the final prognosis.\u201d Crosby flew back to Green Bay for the start of training camp. After a subpar 2018 season, Crosby had to beat out Sam Ficken. Crosby managed to keep his focus and retained the job for a 13th season. \u201cI\u2019ve trained a long time in compartmentalizing different situations,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cWhenever I was home, I was fully home. The organization was unbelievable through training camp, just giving me time to be with Molly and be with the family and help where I could throughout the day and evening. I just tried to be fully in on both things. I have felt a lot of freedom in this. \u201cI love doing what I\u2019m doing but the importance of taking care of family and being there for Molly and the kids, when I look back on it, it was a special camp. I was able to really fully immerse in both things. It was nerve-wracking, too. Day in and day out, it was coming in, having to work and compete at a high level, and then going home and flowing back into a normal routine. Then, we\u2019d sit down at night and you\u2019d remember that surgery was coming and Molly had cancer. Those things were heavy.\u201d That surgery was at the end of the preseason, with part of Molly\u2019s right lung removed. While she will go back to Mayo for a scan in mid-October, Crosby said the doctors are positive they got rid of the tumor and she will not require radiation or chemotherapy. Since 2009, the NFL has held its annual \u201cCrucial Catch\u201d campaign to raise money for the American Cancer Society. It was a campaign that had already hit home for Crosby. A grandmother died of breast cancer and a sister-in-law is in her third year battling ovarian cancer. Now with his wife\u2019s diagnosis, the fight against cancer has grown more meaningful. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s about is early detection,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting routine checkups. Don\u2019t take it for granted. The numbers, with our technology, are amazing with prevention but treating it if you catch it early enough. That\u2019s one of the big things is pushing that. Let\u2019s try to get earlier detection so we can fight this thing. \u201cWith Molly\u2019s cancer, it\u2019s always been really important to me but I\u2019m going to continue to push the charge forward and make sure that everybody gets the care. We feel so fortunate with the care that we got. Hopefully, everybody gets the same care and the same prognosis that we got.\u201d The Packers (3-1) will play at the Dallas Cowboys (3-1) on Sunday. Some of Crosby\u2019s finest professional moments have happened at AT&T Stadium. In the 2010 season, the Packers won the Super Bowl in Arlington. A playoff game in the 2016 season against the Cowboys marked the highlight of his career. His 56-yard field goal with 1:33 to play gave the Packers a 31-28 lead. Dallas tied the score, but Crosby booted a 51-yarder on the final play for a 34-31 victory. \u201cThe two minutes in that game were the most exciting two minutes I think I\u2019ve ever had in a game,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be able to execute it twice in that situation was awesome.\u201d ___ More AP NFL: https:\/\/apnews.com\/NFL and https:\/\/twitter.com\/AP_NFL","label":0,"__index_level_0__":2489}
{"claim_id":"34199","hypothesis":"Intravenous drug users commonly clean their needles by sticking them into rolls of toilet paper in public bathrooms. ","explanation_1":"What's false: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Drug Abuse both said they are not aware of it being a common practice for intravenous drug users to clean needles by stabbing them into rolls of toilet paper. What's undetermined: Whether a photograph shows a roll of toilet paper that was used to clean a needle is unknown.","premise":"In March 2019, a number of social media users encountered a piece of text warning them to be extra cautious in public bathrooms because intravenous drug users purportedly were known to clean their needles by sticking them into rolls of toilet paper:  I took a HAZWOP class about 6 months ago and ever since then I always look at the toilet paper roll in a porta potty or public restroom before deciding to do my business. The instructor warned us about intravenous drug users cleaning their needles by stabbing the dirty needle into the roll of toilet paper to clean the blood off of the tip. This photograph and text was originally shared by Facebook user Gavin\u00a0Aubert. The post racked up hundreds of thousands of shares, but was ultimately deleted after it attracted bots\u00a0that flooded the comments section with spammy links. We managed to get in contact with Aubert\u2019s wife, who told us that her husband truly wrote the text, and that the photograph had been taken at a KFC in Federal Way, Washington. While Aubert\u00a0may be relaying something he actually heard during a HAZWOPER class \u2014 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response is a set of guidelines set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\u00a0 \u2014 that does not mean that this practice is widespread. A spokesperson for OSHA\u00a0told us that the organization had not heard of this practice. We received a similar response from the\u00a0National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The Institute told us that concerned citizens should check with their local public health departments for more information, but, generally speaking, the organization had no evidence that drug users were cleaning needles by stabbing them into toilet paper rolls in public bathrooms. A spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Health said that they were also unaware of any reports of drug users cleaning needles by sticking them into toilet paper rolls: We have never heard of this. This practice seems extremely unlikely because the tip of the needle could break off if one tried to stab it through a toilet paper roll. I\u2019m\u00a0not sure why someone would risk that if what they wanted was to use the same needle for another shot. Logically it would be much easier to wipe off the tip with some toilet paper rather than stabbing it through the roll. Here is the info on how someone would properly clean a needle\/syringe. That said, the best public health practice endorsed by CDC and the US Public Health Service is to use a new sterile needle\/syringe for every injection. We reached out to the Federal Way Police Department but did not hear back by press time. As noted by the Washington Health Department, the method described in this viral Facebook post\u00a0is not effective in cleaning a needle. Health officials also say drug users should never share needles as it puts them at risk of\u00a0getting or transmitting disease such as hepatitis or HIV. HarmReduction.org also recommends against re-using needles in general: The only to definite way to avoid disease transmission of this sort is to never share needles, syringes, or other injection equipment. It is therefore extremely important for every injector to have his or her own set of works, and an ample supply of needles and syringes so that they never have to share or re-use their own\u2014but especially others\u2019\u2014injection equipment. Cleaning needles and syringes is a complicated process that, even if done according to the best scientific advice currently available, is not a 100% fool-proof method of avoiding harmful bacteria, viruses, and other blood-borne pathogens. The\u00a0Centers\u00a0for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0(CDC) states that drug users can reduce the risk of HIV by cleaning their needles in bleach, but this method still does not completely eliminate the risk. The CDC\u00a0suggests that drug users find a local syringe service program (SSP) to obtain free sterile needles: The best way to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV through injection drug use is to stop injecting drugs. Talk with a counselor, doctor, or other health care provider about substance use disorder treatment, including medication-assisted treatment. To find a treatment center near you, check out the locator tools on Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) or www.hiv.gov, or call 1-800-662-HELP (4357). If you continue injecting drugs, never share needles or works. Many communities have syringe services programs (SSPs) where you can get free sterile needles and syringes and safely dispose of used ones. They can also refer you to substance use disorder treatment and help you get tested for HIV and hepatitis. Contact your local health department or North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN) to find an SSP. Also, some pharmacies may sell needles without a prescription. Other things you can do to lower your risk of getting or transmitting HIV, if you continue to inject drugs, include: Cleaning used needles with bleach. This may reduce the risk of HIV but doesn\u2019t\u00a0eliminate it. In short, rumors about intravenous drug users cleaning their needles by stabbing them into rolls of toilet paper in public bathrooms were based on a single, unverified Facebook post. As of this writing, we have not encountered any evidence to suggest that this practice is widespread.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":1390}

{"claim_id":"34360","hypothesis":"Bill Clinton was expelled from Oxford University for raping a British classmate named Eileen Wellstone.","explanation_1":"All in all, the rumors about Bill Clinton\u2019s having been expelled from Oxford over a rape allegation appear to have stemmed from a single uncorroborated, anonymous second-hand report published on a web site of dubious repute in 1999, combined with mere speculation about Clinton\u2019s having departed Oxford prior to the completion of a full two-year course of study. We haven\u2019t yet turned up anything that would counter the notion that the \u201cEileen Wellstone\u201d claim was simply a fabrication made up in 1999.","premise":"As the 2016 presidential campaign closed in on the finish line, the Washington Post published an eleven-year-old tape of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s making controversial remarks about women. The inevitable partisan rancor that ensued largely targeted the behavior Bill Clinton, husband of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, including the repetition of rumors that he had been expelled from Oxford University in 1969 for raping classmate Eileen Wellstone. The allegations weren\u2019t new \u2014 Republican opposition research strategist Roger Stone had tweeted about them a year earlier: In 1969, Bill Clinton was expelled from Oxford for raping nineteen\u00ad-year\u00ad-old Eileen Wellstone.\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/sxR2lCRQ2w \u2014 Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 13, 2015  The backdrop for these rumors was that just prior to his graduation from Georgetown University, Bill Clinton won a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, for two years and headed off to England for the 1968-69 academic term \u2014 but he returned to the United States before finishing out the full two-year course of study. In October 1992, during Bill Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign, a British news report included interviews with a number of Clinton\u2019s Oxford classmates. The article described Clinton\u2019s truncated study trajectory at Oxford as one that was disrupted by the Vietnam-era draft, not by penalties for misbehavior. Had Clinton left Oxford under dubious circumstances, reporting on such a scoop just prior to the presidential election of 1992 would have been irresistible for the British (and American) press. But Clinton\u2019s classmates made absolutely no mention of his departing abruptly or in disgrace: Clinton never completed his degree. In part this was due to his worry about the draft. According to one contemporary, he thought his first year would be his last and so there was little point in doing the work for a two-year degree; in his second year it was too late to start. This was not seen to matter. Many American Rhodes scholars treated their time at Oxford as a version of the Grand Tour. They had their degree and planned to go to law school when they returned to the US; Oxford was an interesting interlude. Clinton\u2019s non-completion of the scholar program at Oxford was public knowledge more than 20 years prior to the origination of rumors that he had been expelled from that university for sexual misconduct. And as documented in a separate article on this site, Clinton\u2019s efforts to avoid the military draft (ostensibly by joining the ROTC at the University of Arkansas) were the likely reason behind the timing of his movements between the U.S. and England. Nonetheless, by June 2004 the Eileen Wellstone rape allegation had appeared in the  Washington Times, published in an article that lacked an author, a citation, or any other information supporting the claim: Bill Clinton calls his sexual encounters with White House intern Monica Lewinsky \u201cimmoral and foolish\u201d and said his \u201crelationship\u201d with Gennifer Flowers was one he \u201cshould not have had.\u201d But in his autobiography flying out of bookstores, he doesn\u2019t mention several other women whose names were linked in scandal with his \u2026 He is less forthcoming about, or does not mention, other women who say they were either sexually involved with him, or that they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. These include: \u2013\u00a0Eileen Wellstone, an English woman who said Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near Oxford University where Mr. Clinton was a student in 1969. Although often unattributed, the claim appears to have originated with a February 1999 article on Capitol Hill Blue (a web site known for publishing dubious information at that time). That primary iteration (since deleted) mentioned nothing about Clinton\u2019s having been expelled from Oxford, but it alleged \u2014 based on a second-hand report from an anonymous source \u2014 that Wellstone had accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her during his time at Oxford: Eileen Wellstone, 19-year-old English woman, said Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near the Oxford where the future President was a student in 1969. A retired State Department employee, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that he spoke with the family of the girl and filed a report with his superiors. Clinton admitted having sex with the girl, but claimed it was consensual. The victim\u2019s family declined to pursue the case. In an interview with Capitol Hill Blue, the retired State Department employee said he believed the story Miss Wellstone, the young English woman who said Clinton raped her in 1969. \u201cThere was no doubt in my mind that this young woman had suffered severe emotional trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we were under tremendous pressure to avoid the embarrassment of having a Rhodes Scholar charged with rape. I filed a report with my superiors and that was the last I heard of it.\u201d Miss Wellstone, who is now married and lives near London, confirmed the incident when contacted, but refused to discuss the matter further. She said she would not go public with further details of the attack. Afterwards, she changed her phone number and hired a barrister who warned a reporter to stay away from his client. In his book, Unlimited Access, former FBI agent Gary Aldrich reported that Clinton left Oxford University for a \u201cEuropean Tour\u201d in 1969 and was told by University officials that he was no longer welcome there. Aldrich said Clinton\u2019s academic record at Oxford was lackluster. Clinton later accepted a scholarship for Yale Law School and did not complete his studies at Oxford. Oxford officials refused comment. The State Department also refused to comment on the incident. A Freedom of Information request filed by Capitol Hill Blue failed to turn up any records of the incident. This account doesn\u2019t jibe with the timeline established in our own research and stated elsewhere, which has Clinton in the United States (not on a \u201cEuropean tour\u201d) during the summer of 1969, and then returning to England for his second year at Oxford (rather than being told \u201che was no longer welcome there\u201d) where he remained at least as late as January 1970:  In his second year at Oxford, Clinton shared a house at 46 Leckford Road with Aller, Strobe Talbot, now an editor at Time, and David Satter, now a judge in Massachusetts. Mandy Merck, now lecturing on feminist writing in New York, arrived at Oxford as an American graduate student in 1969. She met Clinton in her second term and recalls going with him and Sara Maitland, in January 1970, to hear Germaine Greer deliver a lecture on women in literature. Roger Stone was a primary catalyst of the rumor\u2019s spread. But while he maintained in 2014 that Clinton was expelled from Oxford over a sexual assault incident, he said in 2015 that little to no action was taken. His later reference didn\u2019t involve Clinton\u2019s expulsion and hinged on what Stone \u201cbelieved\u201d may have taken place: Ironically, Bill Clinton\u2019s first alleged rape was of a 19-year-old coed named Eileen Wellstone. We believe that he was not prosecuted because the State Department did not want a Rhodes Scholar charged with rape. Stone also made two mentions of Wellstone in his 2015\u00a0book The Clintons\u2019 War on Women, co-authored by Robert Morrow, who was the subject of a 2008 Tampa Bay Times profile which didn\u2019t imply an overabundance of credibility or tendency toward critical examination of Clinton conspiracies: Robert Morrow is on a roll, talking loud enough to draw wary glances from two women lunching nearby at Macaroni Grill. \u201cChelsea is the seed of Web Hubbell and not Bill Clinton. Would I bet my life on it? No. I would bet my pickup truck,\u201d he declares between bites of salmon. \u201cHillary Clinton was sleeping with both of her law partners, Webb Hubbell and Vince Foster. And she\u2019s a lesbian, too.\u201d Morrow, a perpetually indignant, single 43-year-old, pretty much devotes his life to hating the Clintons and spreading wild, unsubstantiated allegations about them. With no job except occasional day trading of stocks, Morrow spends anywhere from one to 10 hours a day researching Clinton dirt or e-mailing and phoning reporters across the country about his conclusions. \u201cI\u2019ve got other aspects of my life when I\u2019m not, you know, stopping Clinton pond scum,\u201d insists Morrow, who has no steady job but enjoys a family inheritance. Lack of proof means nothing to Morrow. Morrow started his anti-Clinton crusade about three years ago, when he decided he needed to devote himself to making sure Hillary Clinton never wins the White House. He can\u2019t pinpoint what set him on this path beyond his conviction that the Clintons are ruthless \u201csociopaths that need to be crushed and defeated.\u201d Stone and Morrow\u2019s book contained two\u00a0passages about Wellstone which appeared be be based on second- or third-hand information. Moreover, those passages contained contradictory information: in one, the authors said Clinton\u2019s expulsion or coerced departure from Oxford \u201ccould not be confirmed\u201d; in another, the authors plainly asserted without qualification that Clinton had been expelled. And all of the cited information traced back to the single questionable 1999 Capitol Hill Blue report: The original Capitol Hill Blue piece included several instances that all followed the same pattern: A young woman whom no one had ever heard of (in most cases the women weren\u2019t even identified by name) had supposedly accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault decades earlier but had declined to pursue any charges against him at the time. Capitol Hill Blue somehow managed to track all these women down, and all of them allegedly \u201cconfirmed\u201d their experiences \u2014 yet none of them was directly quoted, and all of them declined to go on record or discuss the matter any further. Moreover all of these incidents were coincidentally also \u201cconfirmed\u201d by other people (e.g., government officials, retired policemen, former students), none of whom was identified by name or directly quoted either. Even more curiously, as far as we know no one else has ever located, talked to, or interviewed Eileen Wellstone or any of the other women referenced in  Capitol Hill Blue who were supposedly the victim of sexual assaults by Bill Clinton between 1969 and 1974. Nor has anyone else ever identified, located, talked to, or interviewed the anonymous State Department official and others who purportedly \u201cconfirmed\u201d these rumors.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":8306}

The posts, which are limited to a small number of characters and with no linking functionality, are visually bold statements designed to circulate quickly, regardless of their\u00a0veracity.According to this particular rumor, Democrats (led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) attempted to \u201cslip\u201d provisions for \u201ctaxpayer funded abortion\u201d into a bill that is designed to fight the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Alas, no contextual information accompanied the claim, making it difficult for users to check whether it was true before sharing.And share it they did, with more than 44,000 users passing the claim forward as of March 16 2020. A cursory search for similar claims led to a CBN News item\u00a0headlined, \u201cReport: Pelosi Stalled Coronavirus Aid Bill by Trying to Sneak Abortion Funding Agenda into It\u201d:According to several White House officials, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to include federal funding for abortion in the coronavirus economic stimulus plan.In an exclusive story, The Daily Caller reports several officials allege that while Pelosi was negotiating the stimulus package with US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, she tried to lobby for \u201cseveral\u201d provisions which stalled bipartisan guarantees to the measure.CBN referenced the Daily Caller, whose piece\u00a0(\u201cEXCLUSIVE: White House Officials Allege Speaker Pelosi Pushed To Include Hyde Amendment Loophole Into Coronavirus Stimulus Plan\u201d) also leaned heavily on its status as a \u201creport,\u201d citing \u201csources\u201d in the White House:House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to include a potential way to guarantee federal funding for abortion into the coronavirus economic stimulus plan, according to multiple senior White House officials.Speaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for \u201cseveral\u201d provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.The Daily Caller or CBN presumably inspired the sourceless Facebook post, which claimed that Pelosi and Democrats had tried to sneak funding for abortion into an unrelated coronavirus bill. But another top result for \u201cabortion coronavirus bill\u201d was a post on Reddit\u2019s r\/politics, featuring a title with inverse claims:Republicans Are Sneaking Abortion Restrictions into the Coronavirus Bill. Anti-choice lawmakers are stalling emergency legislation. from politicsThat r\/politics post linked to a Vice.com article, which in turn reported that anti-abortion lawmakers were \u201cstalling emergency legislation\u201d around COVID-19. Just as the Facebook post claimed Pelosi \u201cand the Dems\u201d were trying to \u201cslip\u201d funding for abortions into a coronavirus bill, Vice.com\u2019s report (\u201cRepublicans Tried to Sneak Abortion Restrictions into the Coronavirus Bill\u201d) involved \u201creport\u201d or \u201creportedly,\u201d beginning:As lawmakers neared a deal on a coronavirus rescue package that would include paid sick leave and free virus testing, a few roadblocks emerged. Among them: Republican attempts to wedge anti-choice restrictions into the House\u2019s relief bill, turning \u2014 if momentarily \u2014 a public health crisis into an abortion debate.The tensions reportedly revolved around the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old provision that blocks federal funds from going to abortion services, preventing millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid from accessing abortion care. [\u2026]According to conservative media, some top Republicans believed a stipulation in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories doing coronavirus testing could effectively overturn the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions. In response, anti-choice lawmakers insisted on including language in the legislation that would reaffirm the principles of the amendment.According to the Daily Caller, \u201cWhite House officials [said testing reimbursement] would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.\u201d Vice.com said \u201csome top Republicans believed a stipulation in the House bill requiring the government to reimburse private laboratories doing coronavirus testing could effectively overturn the Hyde Amendment by establishing a government funding stream not subject to the restrictions.\u201dBoth approaches described Republican concern over whether a portion of the bill involving reimbursement for laboratories \u2014 if not otherwise stipulated \u2014 would weaken the Hyde Amendment, which explicitly blocks use of federal funds for abortions, by establishing coronavirus-related streams of federal reimbursement not explicitly subject to restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion.Vice.com linked Vox as its source, which framed its March 12 2020 article as reporting on negotiations involving a coronavirus \u201ceconomic relief bill,\u201d which had nothing to do with abortion. Describing an announcement from House Democrats on March 11 2020, Vox.com noted that Republicans and Democrats were working on legislation to offset the financial impact of COVID-19 on Americans.In its fifth paragraph, the article mentioned abortion and the Hyde amendment:House Democrats released their coronavirus economic relief bill late [on March 11 2020, at] night, as layoffs related to the outbreak were reported. But the timing of when they\u2019ll vote on it is still up in the air nearly 24 hours later.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been negotiating the text of the bill with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin throughout the day on [March 12 2020]. The two had their fifth phone call shortly before 4 pm, her spokesperson said. (This piece will be updated as negotiations on the bill continue. )The new multibillion-dollar bill contains a number of emergency economic measures designed to assist working people and families dealing with the virus \u2014 including free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave, and expanded unemployment benefits for those laid off related to the virus. Provisions in the bill expanding food assistance alone would cost $1 billion; a Congressional Budget Office score is expected.\u201cIt will be in the billions, and I won\u2019t go beyond that, but it will be costly,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) told reporters of the bill. \u201cBut I will tell you this: It will be much more costly if we don\u2019t provide relief.\u201d (For context, the federal government\u2019s discretionary spending was well over $1 trillion last year. )The impasse between Republicans and Democrats on the bill centers on two things; Republicans don\u2019t like a provision in the relief bill that would establish a permanent paid sick leave program, and Democrats are pushing back on Republicans wanting to add language referencing the Hyde amendment, which bans federal funds being used to pay for abortions.What is the Hyde Amendment? According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF.org), it came into existence shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision, and it prohibits public funding from being used on abortion or related services in all but a few circumstances:Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, abortion has been squarely in the middle of political debates at the national and state levels. Soon after the Court\u2019s ruling, Congress enacted the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funds from being used to pay for abortion outside of the exceptions for rape, incest, or if the pregnancy is determined to endanger the woman\u2019s life, resulting in dramatically limited coverage of abortion under Medicaid and other federal programs.In Vox\u2019s excerpt above, the words \u201c[Republicans] wanting to add language referencing the Hyde amendment\u201d linked to a March 12 2020 Roll Call item about expected action on the bill the following day (March 13 2020). However, the words \u201cabortion\u201d or \u201cHyde amendment\u201d did not appear in that\u00a0reporting:Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were nearing agreement on an economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the coronavirus pandemic but weren\u2019t close enough to be ready for a vote [on the night of March 12 2020].After eight phone calls between the two, and several hours of meetings between Pelosi and top Democratic lawmakers, negotiations were set to continue into [March 12 2020].It\u2019s fair to say we are close to an agreement subject to the exchange of paper and hope to have an agreement tomorrow,\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., said late [on March 12 2020].If a deal is reached [March 13 2020], the House would vote on the package later in the day. But senators left town for the weekend [on the afternoon of March 12 2020] and can\u2019t take a roll call vote on the measure until [March 16 2020] at the earliest. Despite guidance from state and federal health officials to limit travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many senators planned to go back to their states this weekend before returning to the Hill on[March 16 2020].At the center of the negotiations is a dispute over paid leave provisions in the Democrats\u2019 initial bill. The legislation would require employers to let workers accrue seven days of leave that would apply in future public health emergencies, on top of an immediate 14 days of leave due to coronavirus-related work stoppages.Republicans have been pressing to use the incentive of tax credits to employers rather than government mandates to make paid emergency and sick leave available to workers, according to multiple sources who spoke on condition they not be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.Roll Call\u2019s reporting was in-depth, but it didn\u2019t describe any sort of dispute over abortion or the Hyde Amendment when discussing differences between Republicans and Democrats on the bill. The outlet described provisions sought by Democrats, but didn\u2019t mention taxpayer-funded abortion:The Democrat-authored aid package would offer, in addition to paid sick leave, expanded food assistance, extended unemployment insurance, free coverage of coronavirus testing and increased federal funding for state and territorial Medicaid costs, among other things.Over and again in most articles, talks between the parties were described as \u201csensitive,\u201d and sources for all reporting insisted they not be named. In the same article, a summary of Republican provisions also appeared:Republicans have been pressing to use the incentive of tax credits to employers rather than government mandates to make paid emergency and sick leave available to workers, according to multiple sources who spoke on condition they not be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.On March 13 2020, the\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported Democrats and Republicans hammered out an agreement on an economic stimulus bill during the coronavirus pandemic. Abortion was not mentioned in that reporting \u2014 but it alluded to \u201csome elements\u201d causing a \u201clast-minute hitch\u201d:WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin reached a deal [March 13 2020] on an economic stimulus package to address the coronavirus, providing paid sick leave for workers and pumping billions of dollars to states for food programs and unemployment benefits.Pelosi announced the agreement [March 13 2020 in the] evening, not long after President Trump trashed it at an afternoon news conference.\u201cWe are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,\u201d she wrote in a letter to colleagues late [on March 13 2020].A few hours later, Trump tweeted his own endorsement. \u201cI encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!\u201d Trump wrote.The deal hit a last-minute hitch when some Republicans reportedly voiced concerns about some elements.As of March 16 2020, the bill passed the House and moved to the Senate; neither abortion nor the Hyde Amendment appeared in reporting on the bill\u2019s initial passage in the House and its move to the Senate.The claim we set out to fact-check held that Democrats and\/or Nancy Pelosi attempted \u201cto slip taxpayer funded abortion funding into a Coronavirus bill.\u201d But that\u2019s not what the Daily Caller \u2014 presumptively the first source for the claim \u2014 actually claimed in their reporting. Partisan outlets, both conservative and liberal, accused both parties respectively of delaying the bill as they haggled over abortion, but those same outlets described the same abortion coronavirus bill scenario in strikingly similar terms. Putting aside the fact all those pieces were predicated on \u201csources\u201d who refused to be named (thus making the claims unverifiable and indicating an internecine information battleground within the United States government), the Daily Caller didn\u2019t say that Pelosi or Democrats tried to \u201csneak\u201d or \u201cslip\u201d abortion funding into the coronavirus bill, but instead that that parties had debated whether laboratory reimbursement provisions need explicitly be subject to the Hyde Amendment. One day after the March 12 2020 articles appeared, an agreement was reached and the bill moved on to the Senate.Update, April 15 2020:\u00a0For additional information on the current status of coronavirus stimulus payments, or if your deposit has not arrived, please visit this page:Where is My Stimulus?

Sonny Perdue\u2019s signing of the Sanitary Activity for Food-Processing Enterprises Act celebrated the strength of the state\u2019s food-safety system:  \"\"Georgia has a well-deserved reputation for setting the gold standard for food safety, and the SAFE Act continues our state\u2019s long tradition of protecting the consuming public,\"\" Levitas said in the release. \"\"An overwhelming majority of food processors in Georgia keep quality and safety as their primary concerns. The SAFE Act is intended to keep out the bad actors and punish the few who put profit over human life and safety.\"\" Georgia-produced peanut butter took a huge hit a few years back. The South Georgia town of Blakely was the home to a Peanut Corporation of America plant that helped spawn one of the biggest outbreaks of food-borne illness in the nation\u2019s history. The salmonella outbreak in late 2008 sickened about 700 and was linked to nine deaths nationwide. Georgia Agriculture Department plant inspection reports showed grease and dirt buildup on equipment, unmarked chemical containers and gaps in doors large enough for rodents to scuttle through. One worker testified before Congress that she spotted roaches and rodents inside. Blakely came to symbolize Georgia\u2019s lax culture of food-safety regulation. In 2007, salmonella from ConAgra Foods in Sylvester, the maker of Peter Pan peanut butter, made more than 600 people ill. That same year, botulism was found in canned chili from a plant in Augusta. It was the first outbreak of botulism from commercially canned foods in nearly four decades. Can a state that produced a tainted peanut butter that killed nine people set the \"\"gold standard\"\" for food safety? It\u2019s hard to establish what a \"\"gold standard\"\" might be in the food safety arena. No ranking of state programs exists because it\u2019s difficult to come up with a good way of scoring them. When we asked experts to name states with good systems, they cited Oregon, Minnesota and New York. Not Georgia. We asked Levitas for evidence backing his claim. He said that since the outbreak, the state Legislature has strengthened food-safety laws in two crucial ways: It created a requirement that food processors alert the state within 24 hours when tainted food is discovered, and it made it a felony for food processors to knowingly release\u00a0 contaminated products to the public. The reporting requirement is the result of 2009\u2019s Senate Bill 80, which was passed in response to the peanut butter scare. Food processing safety experts we talked with had not heard of another state with a similar rule, so Georgia is unique in this regard. The problem is that the reporting rule applies to only a portion of food processors. A loophole allows food processors who submit a special \"\"written food safety plan\"\" to avoid being subject to the 24-hour reporting standard, according to the text of the bill, media coverage and interviews with experts. So while this requirement may be unusual, its impact is limited. This year\u2019s House Bill 883 made the knowing release of tainted products to the public a felony in Georgia. Experts said this state law is unusual but the act is already a crime under federal law. Levitas said it was necessary to make releasing tainted food a crime on the state level to help local prosecutors. It\u2019s easier to prosecute a bad food producer in court when there is a death of a consumer if it was the result of a state crime, he said. There are other ways to measure the strength of Georgia\u2019s food-safety system. Some states are better than others at figuring out the cause of an outbreak. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog group, Georgia had 283 tainted food outbreaks between 1998 and 2007. Ninety-nine were solved, said David Plunkett, a staff attorney for the group. \"\"We\u2019d say Georgia is fair to middling,\"\" Plunkett said. Another sign of a good food safety program is adherence to the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program, which was created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state food-safety regulators, said Joe Corby, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials and a respected food-safety expert. These standards, which Corby said are difficult to meet, establish requirements for inspector training, inspection, self-auditing and other procedures. Georgia is among 25 states implementing the program, according to the organization. That\u2019s good, but not great. While Georgia legislators have passed new and sometimes unique food-safety regulations since the peanut butter scare, this state is far short of setting a gold standard. Georgia has a history of major food-safety lapses that have killed and debilitated consumers, and the laws passed in response are limited. Update: A June 13 item on Rep. Kevin Levitas' statement that Georgia sets \"\"the gold standard\"\" on food safety contained a factual error. PolitiFact Georgia said that a new food safety law has a loophole that exempts some processors from having to report tainted food to the state within 24 hours. That's not the case. The loophole allows some processors to submit a special \"\"written food safety plan\"\" in lieu of following testing procedures set by the state but does not exempt those processors from the 24-hour rule. Our original ruling of \"\"\"\" is unchanged. Had Rep. Levitas said the food safety laws in Georgia have gotten stronger, he would have been right, but the \"\"gold standard\"\" is clearly hyperbole. Letter to the Editor Published July 7, 2010 Newspaper's verbal nitpicking misses the point, misleads public  As the AJC has now expressly acknowledged in its correction, the recently enacted SAFE Act has strengthened Georgia's food safety regulations. The act is a giant step by the Legislature toward achieving the \"\"gold standard\"\" that I proudly described. The AJC now portrays my effusive praise as \"\"hyperbole.\"\" There is a vast difference between enthusiasm and falsity, as my statement was labeled. Divergences in characterizations do not reflect disparities in the truth. The AJC's focus on semantics, rather than on substantive benefits to Georgia consumers, does a disservice to its readers. Your paper demonstrated the same hyper-literalism when it scoffed at Roy Barnes's enthusiastic support for education by demeaning his allegoric suggestion that he would scrape gold from the Capitol dome, if need be, to improve education. In both cases, the AJC's verbal nitpicking missed the point entirely and misled the public. The important point was and is that the SAFE Act will move Georgia forward substantially in food-safety protection for Georgia consumers. Unfortunately, the AJC's ceding only about 200 words for my response to its 800-plus word attack devoted to my characterization precludes an adequate reply and prevents readers from having a fair forum in which to make up their own minds.

The industry group also announced a multi-million dollar advertising campaign, focused on U.S. political swing states, that bills the oil and gas industry as a leader in cutting greenhouse gas emissions through improvements in technology. \u201cWe know many candidates now are talking about this industry and we want to make sure the American people hear our story,\u201d said API President and CEO Mike Sommers. U.S. Democrats hoping to run against Trump in November\u2019s election have vowed to rapidly shift the country away from planet-warming fossil fuels if elected to help avert the worst impacts of global climate change. To do so, several candidates here have promised to end new drilling on public lands, and some have proposed a national ban on hydraulic fracking - a controversial drilling technology that pumps water and chemicals into rock formations to access petroleum deposits. They argue that transitioning to a zero-emission economy would create millions of new jobs in clean energy industries like solar and wind that would compensate for jobs lost in drilling and mining. The United States has become the world\u2019s top oil and gas producer thanks to a fracking-led drilling boom. The API will release a report later this week showing that a fracking ban would put over 7 million jobs at risk by 2022 and cost the economy $7.1 trillion by 2030, Sommers said. U.S. emissions here of the gases that scientists blame for climate change, meanwhile, have been declining for about a decade, thanks mainly to the replacement of scores of old and inefficient coal-fired power plants with natural gas facilities. But the future of U.S. emissions has been cast into doubt as the Trump administration seeks to boost domestic fossil fuels development by rolling back Obama-era climate protections and other environmental regulations. While the oil industry has been a vocal supporter of the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory rollbacks, the API\u2019s ad campaign will cast the industry as an ally of Democrats and environmentalists seeking to cut emissions. \u201cOn issues that matter, like climate change, we are more alike than we think,\u201d according to one of the ads here","label":2,"__index_level_0__":3080}
{"claim_id":"31629","hypothesis":"Left-handed people die younger than right-handed people.","explanation_1":"This approach, which is not biased by the same statistical issues as the previous studies, agrees with the general scientific consensus that longevity and handedness are completely unrelated.","premise":"On 19 May 1988, the scientific journal Nature published a brief report by two psychologists titled \u201cDo right-handers live longer?\u201d It\u00a0purported to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in longevity between right and left handers, based on data collected on professional baseball players: To investigate further the relationship between handedness and age of death, we have analysed all baseball players listed in The Baseball Encyclopedia for whom dates of birth and death, as well as throwing and batting hand, are reported. A subject was assigned to a handedness a group only when both throwing and batting hand were the same with no indicated I change in hand use. Mean age at death for the 1,472 right-handers was 64.64 years (s.d. = 15.5) and ( 236 left-handers was 63.97 years (s.d. = 15.4). These same authors published another study\u00a0(\u201cHandedness and Life Span\u201d) in the equally prestigious New England Journal of Medicine by sampling the death records for the year 1990 in two California counties, which demonstrated \u2014 they argued \u2014 an even larger difference in lifespan between left and right handers: In order to test the relation between handedness and life span in a general population, we obtained death certificates from two counties in southern California. Two thousand questionnaires concerning the handedness of the deceased family member were sent to the listed next of kin, which resulted in 987 usable cases (495 male subjects and 492 female subjects). Subjects were designated as right-handers if they wrote, drew, and threw a ball with the right hand. All other subjects (left-handers and mixed-handers) were assigned to a non-right-handed group. When we turn to the effect of handedness on life span, the results are striking in their magnitude. The mean age at death in the right-handed sample was 75 years, as compared with the life-span for the left-handers is significant (Fl,945 = 22.36, P<0.0001). Critics of these studies have noted that their methodologies are flawed, as they assume an static\u00a0proportion of left and right handed people throughout time \u2014 despite the fact that many people who were born in early 1900s were likely pressured to become right-handed at an early age, and would not identify as left-handed at death. Historical records support this argument, presented in the book Language Lateralization and Psychosis: About 90% of people are right-handed and 10% are lefthanded [\u2026]. It is probable that about 8% to 10% of the population has been left-handed for at least the past 200 000 years or so. Detailed data only began to become available for those born in the nineteenth century, and there is growing evidence that the rate of left-handedness fell precipitously during the Victorian period, reaching a nadir of about 3% in about 1895 or so, and then rising quite quickly until an asymptote is reached for those born after about 1945 to 1950, with 11% to 12% of men and 9% to 10% of women typically being left-handed in Western countries. This means that taking at a single cohort of individuals who died in the year 1990 would be biased by the fact that people who identified as left handers were, statistically speaking, a younger group of people. A good explanation of the result of such a bias is provided in a series of letters to the editor regarding the NEJM study, notably this one from epidemiologist Kenneth Rothman: Comparing mean ages at death is a classic fallacy, as it involves comparing only the numerators of rates, rather than the rates themselves. Using the same approach as Halpern and Coren, one would conclude that nursery school is more dangerous than paratrooper training, since the mean age at death of children in nursery school is much lower than that of paratrooper trainees. This same question was\u00a0addressed using data from the Danish Twin Registry, which looked at 118 opposite-handed twin pairs to see which individual died first: We compared mortality in a subgroup of 118 opposite-handed twin pairs by counting in how many instances the right-handed twin died first. There was no evidence of differential survival between right-handed and non-right-handed individuals in the entire 1900\u20131910 cohort. [\u2026] We did not find evidence of excess mortality among non-right-handed adult twins in this follow-up study.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":2292}
{"claim_id":"28936","hypothesis":"Muslim Refugees threatened to slaughter their hosts at Hope Farms in South Africa.","explanation_1":"What's true: A group of refugees threatened to attack their hosts at Hope Farms. What's false: The attackers were all Muslim migrants.","premise":"On 27 December 2015, the disreputable web site\u00a0Mad World News\u00a0published a sensational article about an incident at Hope\u00a0Farm in South Africa. The story centered around a South African couple, who had taken in 143 people following a wave of xenophobic attacks which\u00a0swept\u00a0the country in\u00a0April 2015. A white bleeding-heart leftist couple made headlines when they generously opened their home to a group of Muslim refugees allegedly fleeing devout Muslim militants. However, it didn\u2019t take long for their liberal policies to backfire in a racist and ironic way \u2014 and it\u2019s exactly the poetic justice we\u2019ve been warning about all along. In July, the headline read \u201cMeet the angels who opened their hearts and home to 143 lost strangers,\u201d and the left was drooling over the couple who followed their socialist values to the letter. Andrew and Rae Wartnaby opened up their 50-acre farmland to over 100 Muslim refugees who were reportedly displaced during \u201cxenophobic attacks,\u201d according to News 24. After escaping Islamic brutality in the Central African Republic, the Muslim migrants traveled to South Africa, where they were again set upon by South African natives in black-on-black attacks. So, the good-natured yet naive white couple welcomed the refugee families to their land, which included Obama\u2019s favored \u201cwidows and orphans.\u201d However, after only a few months of graciously allowing the Muslim migrants to live for free on their property, the loving couple soon found that they would actually be the refugees. The Wartnabys were threatened with slaughter by the same people they were helping escape brutality. While Mad World News\u00a0repeatedly states that the incident involved \u201cMuslim refugees,\u201d less sensationalized reports from local sources such as\u00a0News 24 \u00a0and\u00a0eNCA\u00a0made no mention of the group\u2019s religions, referring to them instead as \u201cforeign nationals\u201d \u2014 among the many who had initially fled other parts of Africa because of political persecution and extreme poverty. As the people staying at Hope Farm\u00a0came\u00a0from a wide variety of countries and backgrounds, it\u00a0is unclear how Mad World News\u00a0concluded that they were all Muslim. Nor were they all from the Central African Republic, as\u00a0the article\u00a0reported. According to farm owner Andrew Wartnaby\u2019s personal blog, their\u00a0guests\u00a0originally\u00a0came\u00a0from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and all were\u00a0legally in the country as refugees or asylum seekers. The\u00a0Mad World News\u00a0article also cherry-picked and exaggerated facts in order to chastise this \u201cbleeding heart liberal\u201d couple for taking in refugees. For instance, while it\u2019s true that\u00a0Andrew and Rae Wartnaby were threatened by the refugees, the threats came from a \u201cbreakaway group\u201d and not the entire community: The situation took a turn for the worse two months ago, when the group was informed that each family must make individual applications to the United Nations for relocation. Fifty Five members accepted the terms, but the remaining 85 refused saying they wanted to be moved as a group. Since then, tensions between the two sides have risen. Wartnaby claims that on Tuesday the opposing group refused any food or water that was provided and the next morning, he had to call police to disperse the group which was protesting outside his home. Later that day, the electric fence around his property was cut and Wartnaby later discovered that the main tent had been torched. Mad World News\u00a0also claimed that the Wartnaby\u2019s were \u201cthreatened with slaughter,\u201d but this, too, seems to be an exaggeration. The article published by\u00a0News 24, which was\u00a0the same piece quoted in the\u00a0Mad World News\u00a0article, reported that while Wartnaby did feel unnerved by the threats, he did not believe that the group had any intention to follow through on it: \u201cThe parents were screaming that we had ruined their lives and threatened to kill us, but we did not take them seriously. We, however, later called the police.\u201d Wartnaby said he truly believed that the foreign nationals were making a fuss so that the government would put them up in a refugee camp. Wartnaby told\u00a0reporters\u00a0that while he does not regret taking in the refugees, he does want the breakaway group to leave his farm: \u201cI am not going to help them anymore. The accommodation is burnt and my fence is cut. We have done so much for them in the last five months, we know every one of them by name, we have loved and cared for them and this is how they chose to respond. \u201cIf they want to reject our help, then it is fine, but I still don\u2019t regret taking them in.\u201d The Wartnabys also had to contend with pressure from the local municipality, which in September 2015 ordered them\u00a0to either evict the people living on their\u00a0farm, or rezone the property\u00a0for residential use, a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Wartnaby wrote in a blog entry dated 3 December 2015 that the other group of people staying on their farm \u201care an entirely different story.\u201d They have decided to do everything they can to improve themselves by learning skills, doing courses and building a resume of skills. They are wanting to leave the farm with a \u00a0reference that will help them in the future. They have joined us as volunteers and are helping on the farm, building walls, planting veg and helping in every way they can.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":9155}
{"claim_id":"10149","hypothesis":"Spiriva as good as Serevent in asthma study","explanation_1":"Helicopter pilot Mark Law did not hesitate to fly out to New Zealand\u2019s White Island volcano immediately after it erupted to carry survivors to hospital, but after a harrowing week he knows his town\u2019s adventure tourism industry faces an uncertain future.","premise":"As the search continues for the final two missing bodies from Monday\u2019s deadly eruption, Law knows it will be challenging for his business, Kahu Helicopters. Some of his seven staff, including three pilots, could lose their jobs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be greatly affected, we\u2019re anticipating probably damn near shutting the doors. It\u2019s going to be devastating, we\u2019ve been operating that part of our business for years,\u201d he said. Law is not alone worrying about his future in Whakatane, a picturesque town of 35,000 of the shore of the Bay of Plenty that is the main access point to the volcanic island. Anne Tolley, the local member of parliament, said the town was shattered by the disaster and its thoughts were with the victims, but hoped that tours would one day restart. \u201cIt is iconic and it is certainly is the centerpiece of the town\u2019s tourism. We also have fantastic beaches and walks and the kiwi, but Whakaari, you will have seen all the signs, we are the gateway to Whakaari,\u201d Tolley told Reuters, using the M\u0101ori name for the volcano. Daily tours had taken more than 10,000 visitors every year to privately owned island 50km (30 miles) off the coast. Tours to the island were part of Whakatane\u2019s history, and operators had been gearing up for the peak Christmas holiday season before Monday\u2019s disaster, Tolley said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult coming at probably the busiest time of year for them. It will be devastating.\u201d  On Monday, the 48-year-old Law had quickly organized three other pilots to fly out to the island, where they picked up 10 badly burned people and flew them back to Whakatane\u2019s hospital. Law and his team tried to fly back to the island to recover the bodies of those they knew had died, but were \u201ctremendously disappointed\u201d to be stopped by police. After initially being sidelined from police operations, by mid-week Law was sharing his knowledge of the volcano\u2019s terrain and environment with the military squad that on Friday retrieved six of the eight bodies left behind. On the weekend, the search continued for the remaining bodies. \u201cAt the end of the day people on the ground generally know and it is important\u2026 to weave into the plan the effort of the local people,\u201d Law told Reuters. Shock had ripped through Whakatane at the eruption, with the local hospital overwhelmed as dozens of seriously injured people were delivered from the island. Whakatane\u2019s tourism sector had been growing strongly with the unique marine volcano at its heart, but with the prospect that people may be reluctant to visit the island even if it is reopened, immediate prospects will be challenging. As the recovery mission on Friday played out, Boz Te Moana, 24, and Michael Mika, 28, waited to support their community gathered in the indigenous M\u0101ori marae, or meeting ground. The two, who had traveled from their homes further up the Whakatane River, hoped in time tours to the waters around the island would be allowed again but tourists should not step foot on it again, out of respect for the dead, they said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the mamae or the hurt will ever change, but the environment, it\u2019s up to the town itself to move forward from here in the most positive way,\u201d said Te Moana, using the M\u0101ori word for pain.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":34}

Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday.","premise":"Guterres said the Canadian, due to leave the bank on Jan. 31, was \u201ca remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to work on climate\u201d. He told a news conference before a U.N. climate summit in Madrid beginning on Monday that Carney would be the U.N. special envoy on climate action and climate finance from next year. Michael Bloomberg, billionaire owner of the Bloomberg financial data and news service and former New York City mayor, was the U.N. special envoy for climate action until he stepped down in November, shortly before filing paperwork to run for U.S. president. Carney first spoke of the risks that climate change poses to finance in 2015, and since then has urged better risk management, supervision and disclosure. He has spoken of \u201cstranded assets\u201d - deposits of coal, oil and gas that might lose their value if the world shifts away from carbon - and decried a lack of transparency about the effect on global warming of trillions of dollars of potential investments. The 54-year-old has spent nearly seven years at the head of the bank, and previously led the Bank of Canada and worked for Goldman Sachs. The Bank of England said Carney would seek to make the impact of climate change central to financial reporting, risk management and the calculation of returns ahead of a global summit in Glasgow in November 2020. \u201cThe disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream,\u201d Carney said in a statement. Some 70 countries have promised to go \u2018net zero\u2019 - offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions with measures such as carbon capture or planting trees - by 2050. Last week, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said addressing climate change was a job for governments. But the new head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has promised to discuss sustainability considerations in an impending strategic review. The Band of England said Carney would earn $1 a year in his new role, nearly 900,000 pounds ($1.15 million) less than his annual package at the British central bank. Carney was originally due to leave in 2018 but stayed on to help steer Britain\u2019s economy through the Brexit transition. His successor has not yet been named and Carney has signaled that he would extend his stay beyond Jan. 31 - the date Britain is due to leave the EU - if necessary. Carney had been seen as a contender to lead the International Monetary Fund, but the job went instead to Kristalina Georgieva, former World Bank chief executive.

{"claim_id":"10505","hypothesis":"Drug may cut menopause after breast cancer chemo","explanation_1":"This brief article focuses on a treatment that attempts to preserve fertility for \u00a0young (under 40) breast cancer survivors. It does a good job of describing the potential benefits but leaves gaps in explaining some of the potential limitations and side effects, in particular the failure to mention the potential adverse affects on disease outcome. Young breast cancer survivors can be devastated by the possibility that treating their cancer may leave them unable to bear children. It is critical that they have full information about the impact of treatment \u00a0approaches on their fertility and on their cancer. The editorial is especially useful for practicing physicians partnering with their patients around cancer treatment and fertility issues.","premise":"Costs of the treatment are not mentioned in the article; rather, the costliness of an alternative, storing eggs prior to treatment, is emphasized. The primary benefit from the described approach to loss of fertility in women of child-bearing age with early-stage breast cancer was described as a lowered rate of early menopause. The article did an excellent job of putting this in perspective by including the editorial statement cautioning the reader to not equate resumption of menstrual cycles with preserved fertility. The largest gap in this story is its failure to mention potential harms. In particular, it fails to mention the concern about potential adverse effects on disease outcome, a concern clearly stated in the editorial and in the original article. If longer, this article could have benefited from added detail: long-term outcome data is not available; perhaps most importantly, there is no mention of potential adverse effects on disease outcome. The article headline could have been improved if it included the quality of caution so clearly stated in the last paragraph. The weight of the editorial statement, with a good deal of detail in a few sentences, will be highly useful to readers. This story is free of disease-mongering and clearly states the importance of the issue for a specific population,\u00a0 younger breast cancer patients. The story cited an editorial that accompanied the journal article. However, there was no indication of potential conflicts or lack of conflicts of interest, despite disclosures stated in the journal article. The article did a satisfactory job of mentioning one major alternative to the reviewed procedure. There is no statement in the article as to availability of the treatment, although the information is correctly identified as arising from a \u201cphase three study.\u201d But are readers really supposed to know what a Phase Three study means? Want to do a reader poll to test how many do? The article describes the study as new but fails to indicate whether or not the drug and procedure are new. And as the editorial points out, there are 5 other studies testing this so there is more data out there and it appears to be a bit contradictory. The article did an adequate job of citing the original study and the associated editorial but omitted some significant detail needed to help the reader reach a clear understanding. .","label":3,"__index_level_0__":2329}
