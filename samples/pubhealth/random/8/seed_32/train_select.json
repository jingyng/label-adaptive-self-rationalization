{"claim_id":"23027","hypothesis":"Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the United States.","explanation_1":"Hospital says Georgia's kids second-fattest in nation","premise":"\"The news was enough to make the AJC PolitiFact Georgia scribe toss her leftover Halloween candy corn to the squirrels. \"\"Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the United States,\"\" said a recent news release from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, a hospital that specializes in pediatric care. Second? Out of all the states in the union? Are Georgia kids really that hefty? Yes, we felt guilty. One PolitiFact Georgia reporter had spent a recent afternoon dressed as a witch, handing out fistfuls of sweets to trick-or-treaters. Childhood obesity can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol and other potentially deadly problems. It also places more burdens on the health care system. We called a spokeswoman for Children's Healthcare Atlanta, who pointed us to \"\"F as in Fat,\"\" a report issued by the Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit group that specializes in disease prevention. Sure enough, there Georgia was, second only to Mississippi in 2007 for obesity rates among 10- to 17-year-olds. In this state, 21.3 percent of children were obese, the report said. Mississippi's rate was 21.9 percent. The report defined an \"\"obese\"\" child as one with a body mass index greater than the 95th percentile for his age group. For instance, a 10-year-old boy with a height of 4 foot 6 inches and weighing 100 pounds would be obese. That's because his body mass index is 24.1, which is in the 97th percentile of his age group. Of the 10 states with the highest childhood obesity rates, nine were in the South, the report said. Children in Western states tended to be far more svelte. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest obesity rates were located in that region. The trust used figures from the National Survey of Children's Health, an effort funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The telephone survey asks parents for their children's ages, races, genders, weights and heights. Almost all the state-by-state rankings we found were based on data from that same survey. Understandably, they came up with similar results. The National Kids Count Program, run by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, used the same data to rank Georgia third in 2007. Its analysis ranked a slightly different group of kids: the number of children age 10-17 who are overweight as well as obese. Those are children whose body mass index is above the 85th percentile for their age and gender. A set of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided different results, but this survey was far from comparable. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System asks high school students in grades nine through 12 to report whether they are obese. The CDC does not rank states by high school obesity rates, but the data show that in 2009, 12.4 percent of Georgia high schoolers said they were obese. That's the 19th-highest of the states. But again, high schoolers report their own weight for this survey, and they might not be as accurate as their parents. The CDC does conduct a survey in which children are measured in person, but it doesn't break down the data by state. Why are Georgia's kids so heavy? We could locate no studies that answer that question, but there are some hints. The children who are at the highest risk for obesity are minorities or from rural areas, and they make up a large proportion of the state's child population, said Marsha Davis, a professor at the University of Georgia who studies childhood obesity. In rural areas, parents have trouble getting to supermarkets that sell fruits and vegetables. They end up feeding children with junk food they find at gas station convenience stores. For instance, the agricultural industry in South Georgia's Colquitt County ships produce across the country but sells very little locally, Davis said. The obesity rate there is extremely high. So while there is some variance in what surveys tell us, there's widespread agreement that Georgia kids are obese. And by one widely respected measure, Georgia's kids are the second-most obese in the nation. Now, that's not to say you need to throw out your kid's stash of Halloween candy. \"\"Halloween is fun,\"\" Davis said. \"\"The problem is we're having Halloween every day.\"\".\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":1208}
{"claim_id":"8051","hypothesis":"'Like wartime' - Philippine doctors overwhelmed by coronavirus deluge.","explanation_1":"Private hospitals in the Philippines capital Manila have stopped accepting coronavirus patients in the face of surging numbers of sufferers and people seeking tests, the hospitals said.","premise":"The Philippines has reported relatively fewer infections than many other countries in Southeast Asia, but medical experts say a lack of testing has meant that the scale of the epidemic has gone undetected. \u201cIt\u2019s like wartime,\u201d said Eugenio Ramos, a doctor and head of The Medical City, a Manila private hospital, which was among the first to turn away coronavirus patients. It has attended to more than 1,000 people who feared they had coronavirus and is currently treating more than 100 suspected coronavirus patients, 14 in intensive care. \u201cMore and more are coming, a lot of scared people, some of them already in their advanced stage,\u201d Ramos said this week - adding that facilities were so stretched that many who should be in the intensive care unit were just being intubated with breathing tubes to keep them alive. The scenes are akin to those in hospitals in countries that have been overwhelmed by coronavirus cases, but comes less than three weeks since the country of 107 million reported its first case of local transmission. The Philippines has reported 803 cases and 54 deaths. Malaysia, with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at 2,161, has had 26 deaths. The situation in the Philippines is similar to that in Indonesia, the region\u2019s most populous country, where there is an even higher ratio of deaths to detected cases - an indicator for doctors that the number of infections may be much higher. Former Health Minister Esperanza Cabral said the reported infection rate was probably just the tip of the iceberg, given the Philippines has so far only tested 2,147 people. \u201cWe cannot gauge the extent of the outbreak until we have tested about 10,000 to 20,000 people,\u201d Cabral told Reuters. Testing in the Philippines is to be ramped up with the arrival of 100,000 test kits from China. Modeling from the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford suggests the number of infections in the Philippines may already be higher than 11,000. The Philippines took drastic measures to contain the spread after its first domestic case on March 7, becoming the third country after China and Italy to put its people under home quarantine, suspend transport, work and commercial activity. But the health system is weak. The Philippines, which on average sends 19,000 trained nurses overseas each year, has 10 beds and 14 doctors per 10,000 people, according to data from the World Health Organization. Italy has more than 40 doctors and 30 beds per 10,000 people. An emergency ward worker who spoke to Reuters described patients waiting up to six hours to be seen and inexperienced staff treating critical patients due to manpower shortages. Nine medical workers have died, and hundreds more have been quarantined for being close to sufferers. The University of Santo Tomas hospital has 530 staff quarantined. The Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center said it had insufficient testing kits and protective gear and could not take more coronavirus patients. Under pressure from 11 private hospitals, the government has now dedicated three public hospitals to serve as special COVID-19 treatment centers - but they themselves are also under strain. \u201cWe have every reason to be scared,\u201d the private hospitals said in a letter appealing for help. The head of the emergency department of St. Luke\u2019s Medical Centre, Richard Enecilla, said it had received 120 possible coronavirus-related patients in one day, and made them line up on the hospital driveway to limit exposure. \u201cThe way it exploded caught a lot us off-guard,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThe volume of cases went up and our capacity to serve went down at the same time.\u201d","label":0,"__index_level_0__":1447}

{"claim_id":"9706","hypothesis":"Light therapy effective for treating depression, not just winter blues","explanation_1":"This brief story gives a tantalizing glimpse into a small study of 122 people with major depression, but it leaves us wanting a bit more. The randomized controlled study divided patients into groups with some receiving light therapy alone, some receiving light and antidepressant, and others received sham therapies imitating light and placebo medication. The most improvement was seen in the groups receiving light alone or light-plus-antidepressant. Paraphrasing the researchers, the story concludes that \u201cenough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression.\u201d But the story never really backs up that statement. It doesn\u2019t make the case for why this one rather small study puts the evidence squarely beyond doubt. Nor does it delve very deeply into the study\u2019s limitations. We would have welcomed more metrics and a clearer explanation for how this one study could change practice going forward. Major depression is the second-ranked cause of disability in the world, and estimates say it strikes 1 in 20 people in the United States. If light therapy, which is relatively low-cost, could improve the treatment of major depression it would help millions. It might also be an economic boon by helping relieve the lost wages and crippling disability of those who remain diminished for years.","premise":"The story squeaks by on this with mention that light therapy is \u201ccheap\u201d and easy to use. We would have preferred some numbers giving prices for the light sources that patients typically use at home and some estimate for a therapeutic course of psychotherapy (which is often provided in combination with light therapy). The only attempt to describe benefits is vague. Here it is, with italics by editors: \u201cAlthough the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. About 60 percent of those using light therapy with the antidepressant reported feeling almost back to normal, Lam said.\u201d Quantifying means we\u2019d like to know some metric or measure that researchers used to compare the different groups of patients. In the original journal article, the authors said they used MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) changes from baseline to 8 weeks into the different therapies. It would be useful to know where they started on that scale and where they ended up \u2014 and whether that difference was meaningful. The short story does not mention potential harms of light therapy., and it doesn\u2019t say there are few or none known. Either way, we would have liked the story to address the notion of harm\u00a0I [Editor\u2019s note: As pointed out by a commenter, the story does note that light therapy \u201ccomes with few side effects compared to medication such as antidepressants.\u201d That\u2019s more than we gave the story credit for initially, but we decided to keep the Not Satisfactory rating because the story does not say what any of those side effects are or how frequently they occur.] Interestingly, if you look at the table on adverse effects in the original study, it shows that close to 1\/4 of those on light therapy experienced diarrhea. We can\u2019t exactly explain that strange finding but it was worth mentioning. The story establishes this was double-blind randomized controlled study with a high quality of evidence. But it doesn\u2019t comment on the fact that there were only 122 participants and that this was not a large sample. The small size of the study is puzzling since the study\u00a0used three centers over five-plus years. It also was conducted in Canada, which has shorter days in the winter and long ones in the summer compared with the U.S. The relation of the treatments to these cycles was not discussed. In short, there were a number of questions about this study that could have received more thorough attention, but the story didn\u2019t address any limitations and was unwaveringly positive in its description. Especially for a U.S. audience, it would be important to see this study replicated at U.S. latitudes and in a larger study sample to say that light therapy is unquestionably effective for non-seasonal depression. There was no disease mongering. The story included a quote from an independent source other than study authors, so we\u2019ll award a Satisfactory. However, it would not have taken much to find someone who would have raised some questions about the study and offered a note of caution or two. Even in a short word count, this story did convey that there are alternatives, including antidepressants and psychotherapy. Since these lights probably aren\u2019t very difficult to find, we\u2019ll rate the story Not Applicable here. The story doesn\u2019t specifically address availability and it could have noted what kind of light is needed and whether these lights are widely available. But we won\u2019t ding the story for not mentioning this. The story does not say this was the first randomized trial about non-seasonal depression and refers to previous research. It does imply that this study reinforces a change in practice to include light therapy as another alternative. We wish the story had explained perhaps why this study could lead to a conclusive change in practice. Because an independent source is quoted, we can be reasonably certain that this story went beyond any news release.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":8090}

Lawmakers responded to the commission\u2019s first set of recommendations by enacting a package of school-safety measures, including raising the legal age for gun purchases, requiring armed security officers on every campus and adopting a \u201cred flag\u201d law. \u201cThe needle has moved. We\u2019re in a better place than we were 20 months ago,\u201d Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who chairs the commission, said in an interview. \u201cBut we\u2019re still not in the place where we want to be in many places in Florida, and there\u2019s more work to be done.\u201d The 389-page document released Friday by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission advocates new laws that would allow authorities to act more quickly against threats of violence, including making it a felony to verbally threaten a mass shooting. While the commission\u2019s first report, released in January, focused on the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, and some of the specifics that led to the massacre, this one provides a broader analysis of systemic issues that the commission wants addressed. Key among them, according to the commission, is mental health. Among its findings: Florida\u2019s mental health system is inadequately funded. The commission, noting Florida\u2019s rank among the lowest of any state in per-capita mental health funding, recommended that the Legislature authorize more spending on mental health programs. The commission, however, did not suggest a specific amount and instead recommended an assessment of how mental health resources are being deployed. Gualtieri said the mishmash of mental health services, limited as they currently are, may sometimes prevent children with behavioral problems from getting the help they need. The commission wants better coordination of services, including better information sharing, to help identify trouble before exploding into harmful situations. The commission also wants to empower judges to intervene whenever they identify a child who might benefit from mental health treatment. In his message prefacing the report, Gualtieri said complacency and noncompliance \u2014 even resistance to the new laws \u2014 undermine the work being done to make schools safer. \u201cComplacency is driven, at least in part, by the erroneous notion that a school shooting will not \u2018happen here\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone needs to proceed with a sense of urgency to make Florida\u2019s schools as safe as possible because there will be another K-12 active assailant attack in this country,\u201d Gualtieri said. \u201cThe only questions are when and where.\u201d","label":0,"__index_level_0__":4103}
{"claim_id":"38992","hypothesis":"\u00a0 A Germanwings airbus crash in the French Alps that killed 150 people was an act of terror because Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam before the crash. ","explanation_1":"Germanwings Pilot Had Converted to Islam-Investigation Pending!","premise":"There has been a lot of speculation about why Germanwings co-pilot Andrea Lubitz intentionally flew an airplane into a mountain, but there\u2019s no clear answer yet. The Germanwings airbus crashed into the French Alps on March 24, 2015. Two days later, Germanwings  said in a statement that the crash \u201cappeared\u201d to be a deliberate act by co-pilot Andrea Lubitz: \u201cWe are horrified to discover today that the aircraft that crashed in the south of France appears to\u00a0have been crashed deliberately \u2013 probably by the co-pilot of flight 4U9525. Based on audio taken\u00a0from the voice recorder, the French authorities have come to the conclusion that after the aircraft\u00a0had reached cruising altitude, the captain left the cockpit for a short time and was then unable to re-enter. It appears that the co-pilot, who had stayed in the cockpit, prevented the captain from re-entering by fully locking the cockpit door in order to then initiate the fatal descent. All Germanwings\u00a0and Lufthansa employees are deeply shocked. We could never have imagined that a tragedy like\u00a0this could occur within our company.\u201d It\u2019s not yet known why Andreas Lubitz would deliberately fly the plane into the side of a mountain. Early reports indicated that Lubitz had been treated for mental illness in the past and had previously attempted suicide. French authorities found a torn up sick note from a doctor that would have excused Andreas Lubitz from work on the day of the crash, but the reason for the note hasn\u2019t been revealed. Germanwings  said that Lubitz didn\u2019t submit the sick note to them. German officials said that Andreas Lubitz had hid \u201can unspecified medical condition\u201d from his employers, the Telegraph  reports: \u201cThe fact there are sick notes saying he was unable to work, among other things, that were found\u00a0torn up, which were recent and even from the day of the crime, support the assumption based on\u00a0the preliminary examination that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and his professional\u00a0colleagues. \u201cThe prosecutors said in a statement that the documents were found in searches of Lubitz\u2019s homes\u00a0in Duesseldorf and in the town of Montabaur in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. \u201cThe Uniklinik hospital in Dusseldorf confirmed that it had treated Lubitz in recent weeks but said it\u00a0was not for depression. \u201cMeanwhile Bild, the German newspaper, reported that \u2018Lubitz had a serious relationship crisis with\u00a0his girlfriend before the disaster and the resulting heartbreak is thought to have led to this.\u2019\u201d Just before the crash, Andreas Lubitz\u2019s pregnant girlfriend broke up with him. Her friends said Lubitz was a \u201ctormented and erratic man\u201d who suffered from unpredictable behavior and mood swings. He had also been having an affair with a Germanwings flight attendant in the months leading up to the crash, the Daily Mail  reports. Early indicators suggest that Andreas Lubitz suffered from mental illness and that led him to deliberately crash the airplane. Sill, other theories claim that it was an act of terrorism and that Lubitz had converted to a radical form of Islam. One of those  claims comes from the German blog site Pi-News: \u201cAll evidence\u00a0indicates that the copilot of Airbus\u00a0machine in his six-months break during his\u00a0training as a pilot in Germanwings, converted to Islam and\u00a0subsequently either\u00a0by the order of \u2018radical,\u2019 ie. devout Muslim , or received the order\u00a0from the book of terror, the\u00a0Quran, on his own accord decided to carry out this\u00a0mass murder. As a radical mosque in Bremen is in the center of\u00a0the\u00a0investigation, in which the convert was staying often, it can be assumed that\u00a0he \u2014 as Mohammed Atta, in the\u00a0attack against New York \u2014 received his\u00a0instructions directly from the immediate vicinity of the mosque.\u201d That report has been repeated by a number of blog sites across the web. However, Pi-News isn\u2019t a trustworthy news source. The website  describes itself as against \u201cthe mainstream, America, Israel, basic and human laws and the fight against the Islamisation of Europe.\u201d Officials in France and Germany have not said that the crash could have been an act of terrorism, but the investigation is ongoing.

Acute pain from a back injury, depending on the source and severity, often goes away with no more help than the body\u2019s natural ability to heal over time. Dr. Shamie said he himself practices yoga but stressed that while he generally considers it beneficial, people with back pain need to see a medical doctor before jumping into an exercise regimen: One needs to objectively look at her symptoms and try and correlate the symptom with a diagnosis \u2014 when did her pain start versus what medical conditions are acute. Then you have to see if yoga is an appropriate treatment\u00a0for that diagnosis. If someone has a fracture of the spine, the last thing you want to do is go and do a down dog. It\u2019s\u00a0not uncommon for patients and their loved ones to\u00a0mistake whatever course of action they\u2019ve taken to relieve their symptoms\u00a0as a miracle cure when it coincides with relief (even though the relationship isn\u2019t necessarily a causal one): Yoga, regular exercise, appropriate diet, regular and ample hours of sleep all have a positive effect on your sense of well being. But to say someone was suffering from three conditions, not know which was symptomatic and saying after yoga all three of them got better, I think it\u2019s a stretch. Notwithstanding that, I believe that yoga is definitely a great form of exercise and can certainly, if done correctly, with proper guidance and training, help with pain that many people\u00a0are suffering from regarding the spine and may even increase the longevity of your spine. Like any other exercise regimen, if done inappropriately and with bad habits can actually be harmful. Dr. Jeffrey Wang, co-director of the Spine Center at the University of Southern California and professor of orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery, said yoga does help some of his patients \u2014 the regimen can help straighten out a hunched spine if the patient doesn\u2019t have a rigid deformity, which can only be corrected through surgery: There are people\u00a0that lean forward because their muscles are fatigued and tired. The bone isn\u2019t in that position, it\u2019s the muscles. If you strengthen the muscles you can get back your posture. The danger is that there are a lot of people\u00a0in her age group that have fixed deformities\u00a0that are not flexible. If so you can do all the exercises in the world and it\u2019s not going to give back your posture. He believes Pesce to have had a flexible deformity, which are caused by muscle weakness and not fixed skeletal issues. If that is the case, it is possible yoga could have helped her strengthen core muscles and straighten out her back: You have someone who has a flexible deformity that had weak muscles and\u00a0got into a good exercise program and I think that\u2019s fantastic. Pesce\u2019s yoga instructor, Rachel Jesien, pointed out that she and other teachers she works with have developed a special yoga program to help people with scoliosis and other back problems. She said Pesce\u2019s dedication and hard work were key to her recovery.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":8942}
{"claim_id":"34601","hypothesis":"Hanging plastic bags filled with water will repel flies.","explanation_1":"Will hanging plastic bags filled with water repel flies from your area? Opinion is divided on that technique's effectiveness.","premise":"In the same vein as the oft-asserted claim that leaving bottles of water on one\u2019s lawn will keep dogs from using that space as their personal lavatory is the belief that see-thru plastic bags filled with water and hung where flies can see them will keep those airborne pests at bay. Numerous folks swear by the practice, with restaurant operators from the Florida Keys to Texas numbering among that group. While the Internet-circulated how-to on repelling flies mandates the inclusion of four pennies in the bag, others who endorse the practice advocate placing only a single penny in each water-filled pouch, and others recommend using instead flakes of tin foil. However, the most common array of this sort is the unadorned bag of water, with such filled pouches to be either taped to one\u2019s doors or suspended in areas where flies are a particular problem. As to whether this method works, some swear by it, while others who have tried it assert that such preventives don\u2019t deter the flies one whit. Theories abound as to why such a practice might work. Some practitioners claim that flies perceive such bags as the surface of a large body of water and therefore avoid them. (This is a somewhat puzzling explanation, as flies are no strangers to ponds, puddles, lakes, and the like). Others maintain that the flies are scared off at seeing their own magnified reflections in the water bags. (Again, though, flies don\u2019t seem to shy away from other types of surfaces that reflect and\/or magnify their images.) The most common theory is that flies bases their sense of direction by where sunlight is coming from, and their complex eyes are overwhelmed and confused by the multi-directional refracted light produced by the bags, causing them to fly off rather than hang around. Science has yet to provide a definitive answer either way. In 2007, Mike Stringham, a North Carolina State University (NCSU) researcher, reported on his findings after spending 13 weeks studying the effects of water bags on flies at an egg-packing plant. After meticulously counting droppings left by flies on white \u201cspot cards,\u201d he concluded that the bags, rather than repelling the flying annoyances, actually attracted more of them. Said Stringham, \u201cIn the control room versus bags, the bags were consistently higher every time.\u201d  However, Stringham\u2019s study was conducted indoors under fluorescent and incandescent lighting, a factor which may limit its applicability: it\u2019s possible the effects of direct sunlight on the bags might produce a different result (as sunlight in outdoor environments varies and dances in ways that unwavering manmade sources of light do not). A December 2010 episode of Mythbusters found no significant difference between the number of flies attracted to a chamber holding both rotten meat and a plastic bag of water (without coins) and one which held only rotten meat. As with the NCSU experiment, however, the results might have been an artifact of the particular setup used rather than proof of a general truism. San Francisco Examiner columnist Richard Fagerlund (aka \u201cBugman\u201d) has tackled this question (in a decidedly unscientific way) several times over the course of years:  Q: At a Mississippi drive-in, I questioned the waitress about the bag of water over the door, thinking it might be a prank. I am 51 and had never come across this so I thought she was kidding when she told me it repelled flies. She was familiar with its use last summer and was convinced that it is a valid theory. I was motivated to look it up on the Internet. What can you tell me about it? A: This is a result of a column I wrote a number of years ago and is worth repeating. Fill a sandwich-size Ziploc bag about half full of water. Tape the top of the bag to the outside of your door. Replenish the water as needed. It is not clear why these water bags repel flies, but they do. I have gotten a ton of mail from all over the world when this column originally ran and the mail ran 9 to 1 saying this method worked. You may also get some questions from visitors as to why you have a Ziploc bag of water on your front door. Some possible answers are: It attracts flies. It scares flies. If it freezes, we know it\u2019s cold outside. If it boils, we know it is hot outside. I don\u2019t know, ask the Bug Man, it was his idea. When you drive around town, look for Ziploc bags on doors and you will know who reads this column. A possible explanation for the \u201cbags of water repel flies\u201d phenomenon is simple confirmation bias. When people put up bags of water and notice a decrease in the amount of flies hanging around (for reasons which are coincidental and have nothing to with any actual repellant qualities of the bags), they gleefully report far and wide that the method absolutely works. But when people try it and obtain no noticeable positive results, they tend to simply forget about it and move on without publicizing the outcome of their efforts.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":3818}

It is transcribed below:THE REGIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES COUNCIL OF NEW YORK CITY, INC. NYC REMACAdvisory No. 2020-08 Title: TEMPORARY Cardiac Arrest Standards for Disaster Response Issue Date: March 31, 2020 Effective Date: Immediate Supersedes: n\/a Page: 1 of 1The Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC) of New York City is responsible to develop, approve and implement prehospital treatment and transport protocols for use within the five boroughs of the City of New York. The Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC) of New York City operates under the auspices of Article Thirty of the New York State Public Health Law.The NYC REMAC proudly thanks the EMS Professionals tirelessly working to protect and serve the residents of NYC and recognizes that EMS provides an ESSENTIAL service to this city, state and country.Basis: In order to ensure the safety of our providers while also providing care to our patients, the following changes have been made in the Cardiac Arrest procedure: \u2022 No adult non-traumatic or blunt traumatic cardiac arrest is to be transported to a hospital with manual or mechanical compressions in progress without either return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or a direct order from a medical control physician unless there is imminent physical danger to the EMS providers on the scene. \u2022 In the event a resuscitation is terminated, and the body is in public view, the body can be left in the custody of NYPD. \u2022 In the event NYPD response is delayed call the following:o NYPD DOA Removal: 646-610-5580Current and Updated Protocols can be accessed at the Regional EMS Council website: www.nycremsco.org.Owners\/operators of Ambulance and ALS First Response Services providing prehospital medical treatment within the five boroughs of the City of New York are responsible to provide copies of the NYC REMAC Prehospital Treatment Protocols to their personnel, and to ensure that Service Medical Directors and EMS personnel are informed of all changes\/updates to the NYC REMAC Prehospital Treatment Protocols.On NYC REMAC\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page, a brief explanation of the organization\u2019s purpose and scope appeared:The Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of New York City, Inc., is a not-for-profit, tax exempt corporation created in 1974,whose function is to improve and coordinate emergency medical services in New York City. In 1976 the Council was designated by the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York as the Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of New York City under Article 30 of the Public Health Law.The Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of New York (REMSCO), is responsible to the State of New York for coordinating medical services in all five boroughs of New York City. The Council was established and designated to be the policy and administrative authority within the New York City region.The Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC) was established to provide medical control for the EMS System.REMAC develops policies, procedures and triage, treatment and transportation protocols which are consistent with the standards of the New York State Medical Advisory Committee but address the specific needs of New York City.We tried to contact regional EMS authorities in Suffolk and Nassau Counties on Long Island, the balance of areas reportedly covered by the new advisory. We will update this page if we hear back from any of the agencies we contacted.We also located a March 29 2020 Nassau County EMS advisory about transport and cardiac arrest [PDF], involving the following updated directive:NO adult medical cardiac arrest is to be moved to a hospital with manual or mechanical compressions in progress without either return of spontaneous circulation or a direct order from a medical control physician unless there is imminent physical danger to the EMS providers on the scene.On April 2 2020, WNBC carried a similar report about EMS protocols on Long Island and in the five boroughs of New York City, \u201cGrim New Rules for NYC Paramedics: Don\u2019t Bring Cardiac Arrests to ER for Revival.\u201d In summarized bullet points at the top of the page, WNBC clarified the scope of the orders and the areas affected (New York City, Suffolk County, and Nassau County):\u2022 A regional EMT group has issued new guidelines almost unthinkable even days ago \u2014 if someone\u2019s in cardiac arrest and you can\u2019t revive them in the field, don\u2019t bring them to the emergency room \u2022 The guidance from the Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of New York City applies to the city as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties. The group, known as REMSCO, is the state-designated coordinating authority for the region \u2022 The newly implemented order takes effect [on April 2 2020] in an effort to control the surge of patients in hospitals due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemicIn the broader article, WNBC detailed some of the new protocols\u2019 provisions, including directives for handling the bodies of patients not transported to hospitals for resuscitation:The guidance from the Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of New York City applies to the city as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties. The group, known as REMSCO, is the state-designated coordinating authority for the region.Typically, if someone has had cardiac arrest, and even if there\u2019s no blood flow, EMS units will perform CPR and other lifesaving measures while en route to the hospital. Now, with very limited exceptions, that\u2019s not to happen.Additionally, REMSCO says if the body is in public view, the EMTs can call NYPD to safeguard the body until the Medical Examiner or funeral home can pick it up.Although initial reporting on the revised EMS guidelines in New York City and on Long Island were initially framed as rumors (and some of the initial claims were inaccurate), the underlying claim is true. As of April 2 2020, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were provided binding guidelines wherein patients in cardiac arrest and those unresponsive to cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would no longer be transported to the hospital. The guidelines affected the five boroughs, Nassau County, and Suffolk County, and included information about safeguarding the bodies of patients not resuscitated during those calls.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":5572}

Was this yet another glimpse into the machinations of a \u201cbridezilla,\u201d a gal so caught up in the plans for her wedding that she turns into a monster? Or was it something else? Example: [Dear Abby, 2003] MEMO TO MY ATTENDANTS: Hey, girls! Mom has your dresses for the wedding. She\u2019ll bring them to the shower next weekend. You can pick them up there. Allison sent me an e-mail asking what style shoes and jewelry to wear. Great question, Allison! There are so many details. I keep forgetting to tell my girls what to do.This is an excellent opportunity to go over my expectations for each of you: About the shoes, please wear tasteful flats. Most of you are taller than me. I\u2019d rather you not all tower over me. I want all of you to wear your hair down. Since Babs and Allison have similar hair, I\u2019d prefer that Babs straighten hers and let Allison be the curly-haired girl. After all, she\u2019s my friend and you are just bridesmaids! I\u2019m sure you understand. Judy and Molly, you have both mentioned that you intend to shed a few pounds. This would be the perfect time! Watch your diets; we will all start weekly weigh-ins. Allison could use some trimming down, too. Also, you should all stay away from alcohol for at least a week before the wedding. None of us should be puffy or bloated. I think this is mainly for Babs, as none of my ladies drink all that much. Other than that, I don\u2019t have any real suggestions. Oh, please don\u2019t go tanning! I prefer to blend in with you than stand out as the pale one! Judy, Allison and Molly, please call me. There are a few other things that I need to go over with you on this topic. Babs, you are Scotty\u2019s friend, so I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell you what needs to be corrected \u2014 plus, your own wedding is coming up after mine. So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already more than a little aware of what you need to work on. See y\u2019all on Saturday. Babs, remember you\u2019ll attend the shower with us girls rather than the paintball fun with the boys. Dress accordingly, dear! Bridezilla tales are nothing new to the Internet, and usually after blossoming briefly to horrify the masses, they quietly fade into obscurity. This one, however, gained a shot in the arm when it appeared in a Dear Abby column in September 2002. Readers sent the much-traveled e-mail to Abby, seeking her comments. She offered no opinion on whether the story was true but replied: If the document you sent me is on the level, the bride-to-be appears to have an abundance of unresolved control issues and an astounding lack of tact. Abby\u2019s observation was dead on. It also brings us back to the \u201cwas this for real or not?\u201d element of the tale. You see, if this had been a hoax, it would have been designed to make its purported author look especially heinous. And there\u2019s a strong chance that\u2019s exactly what happened. A couple of small sections of the earlier e-mail were left out of the Dear Abby version, namely: [Following \u201cMost of you are taller than me, so would rather you all not tower over me\u2019] Plus, many of you are unaware, but Addie is terribly ill and sometimes is paralyzed from the waist down. And we do want to take care of Adam\u2019s girl! [Following \u201cLindsay could use some trimming up too\u201d] Addie, you just take care of yourself. I know that some of us have trouble with food and I don\u2019t want to encourage any bad habits with those who have had problems in the past. (In the February 2002 original, all the participants had different names: The curly-haired friend was Lindsay instead of Allison; Leisha and Sissy were the gals who needed to lose weight, not Judy and Molly; Addie, instead of Babs, was the paintball-loving two-fisted drinker who was soon to marry the problematic Adam, not Scotty; and the now-nameless bride signed herself as Jenny.) A careful reading of the original reveals little digs are made at Addie (Babs) throughout the piece. Granted, brides do not always get along famously with their bridesmaids, but this level of barely suppressed hostility is unusual. The unrelenting Addie-bashing should sound a few distant warning bells in those tempted to take the letter at face value, because the behavior doesn\u2019t fit the occasion. Addie drinks too much, has \u201cfood problems,\u201d is marrying a loser, is dead from the waist down, should have her hair straightened because another bridesmaid preferred by the bride also has curly hair, and has to be reminded to dress properly for the shower on Saturday to head off her turning up in shorts and a dirty T-shirt. The letter wasn\u2019t so much an \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding and here\u2019s how I want to run it\u201d missive as it was a bashing of one girl. Some mailings identified the bridezilla in question, so we asked her about it. She replied that while she\u2019d been made the goat of this affair, she hadn\u2019t written the letter; the piece had been the work of a disgruntled ex-boyfriend of Addie\u2019s. This fellow had somehow gained access to Addie\u2019s e-mail account, fabricated a letter supposedly written by the bride, and propagated it as if it were something Addie had received and was now forwarding to others. In this way, everyone in Addie\u2019s address book got to see all the little digs at her. Is this a reasonable scenario? In an oddball way it is \u2014 it certainly better explains the \u201cAddie bashing\u201d element of the letter than does the \u201cbitchy bride\u201d construct. Bridezillas are generally far too lost in what\u2019s going on with them to spare much attention for any member of the wedding party other than themselves. A true bridezilla would barely recognize that her bridesmaids had lives outside of the wedding, let alone be capable of diverting the focus of attention from herself to any of them. Jenny\u2019s explanation may be plausible, but since we can\u2019t prove the story one way or the other, we\u2019ll leave this one marked as \u201cUndetermined.\u201d The letter in question appeared in the May 2002 issue of Cosmopolitan as a sidebar to a larger article about bridezillas. All the names were changed once again. The current bridezilla tale echoes an older e-mail similarly transmitted across the Internet in 1999. Please note that the claims of this letter\u2019s having been penned in all seriousness by a real bride have not been substantiated, but the piece did run in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1991. Harper\u2019s presented it as: \u201cFrom a letter sent by a Youngstown, Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers in 1976. Since then, copies of the six-page, single-spaced letter have been circulating nationally among engaged and newlywed couples.\u201d EDITORS NOTE: This is an actual 1976 letter from a Youngstown,Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers. Read it and count your blessings. (FROM HARPER\u2019S MAGAZINE)Dear Bridal Party: From time to time I will be dropping everyone a line or two to keep each of you informed about how the wedding plans are progressing so that no one thinks I have forgotten them and no one is in the dark. Bridesmaids: Each bridesmaid will receive her dress via mail from Priscilla of Boston sometime in January. This will give each of you enough time to have the dress \u201cprofessionally\u201d altered if need be. The dresses are chiffon \u201cPriscilla\u201d dresses and can be worn after the wedding. The right shoulder is bare and there is no sleeve on the left arm. Each has its own cape, which goes almost to the floor. The two matrons of honor will be in silver and the four bridesmaids in peppermint green. As of this date, I have not decided whether the two in silver will wear green gloves and the four in green silver gloves, but long gloves will be worn. I strongly suggest that each person shops now for the typical cloth \u201cclosed-toe\u201d shoe. Keep the heel size reasonable \u2013 of course, no platforms of any kind. Anyone having trouble with their legs should wear support hose. Ushers: Each usher will be dressed identically to the groom, best man, and the head groomsman: black tails. Be sure you have black silk socks and black dress shoes polished to a high shine. Reception Rehearsal: On Saturday afternoon (early) we will go to Powers Auditorium to practice for the reception that night after the wedding ceremony. Why? Well, there is a long staircase at the auditorium that will be put to full use: Each bridal-party couple will be introduced separately and will proceed down the first half of the staircase (accompanied by music). Upon reaching the platform in the middle of the stairs, the girl will be required to \u201cswirl\u201d from the right side of the steps and move to the left side, and her partner (an usher) will move to the right; then they will proceed down the second half of the stairs and take their positions for the Bridal Dance. Dancing: I will try to find a choreographer to help with the Bridal Dance \u2014 but each person can please do his or her part by learning to waltz correctly in three-quarter time. Now, when I say waltz, I do not in any way mean two steps here and two steps there, always standing in one spot. When we waltz it will be to \u201cTales of the Vienna Woods.\u201d Each usher will be twirling his partner while moving in a large circle and maintaining even spacing between each couple. Turn on some old-time movies and you can see how it is supposed to be done. But, PLEASE, PLEASE, practice now! Suggestion: Go take dancing lessons!! That\u2019s what we have to do!! Also, there will be some polkas, the Charleston, jitterbug, and others. These are not \u201crequired\u201d dances. There will not be any up-to-date dances. I personally dislike them and think they look terrible-they simply are not dances, in my estimation. Photographs: There will be plenty. First and foremost, there will be \u201csound motion pictures\u201d taken throughout the wedding ceremony, during the Bridal Dance, and while each bridal-party couple walks down the steps at the reception. Flash pictures will be taken in the church ONLY until my father and I arrive at the altar-after that there will be NO flash pictures; the official photographer will be taking time exposures. I believe it is the height of ill manners for any guest to leave his or her seat and proceed to the altar to take pictures. Dress Requirements: Makeup \u2014 It is requested that you wear a little more than usual because of the photographs and the movie pictures. Any ladies with short eyelashes are requested to wear either false eyelashes or go to a beauty parlor and have false eyelashes put in one by one. The matrons of honor wearing the silver dresses must have a lot of pink in their makeup. That is straight from Priscilla. Be sure that each of the four other bridesmaids has green eyeshadow and that every one wears blusher, powder, eyebrow pencil, foundation, lipstick, and mascara \u2014 the works!! There will be two experts in the field of makeup to help anyone who needs it or wants it. As for the men, ho, ho, you will have your turn also. If you have a shiny face, be sure to use some of your wife\u2019s face powder to take the shine away. For the wives and husbands of those who are in the wedding party: Ladies-the color of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses has been stated, and all that I ask is that your dress be a color that will not contrast with the peppermint green, that it is of full length, and fairly simple in line. Also, please do not wear an extensive amount of jewelry, as the bridesmaids will possibly wear only small pearl earrings. Be sure each of you has gloves. You need wear nothing in your hair. Men \u2014 Amy Vanderbilt\u2019s book on etiquette says that anyone receiving a formal invitation is to wear \u201cblack tie,\u201d which means tuxedo. Now, this could get rather touchy, so I will put it this way: If you do not wish to wear a tux, or do not wish to take on the expense of renting one, it will be perfectly fine to wear a \u201cblack\u201d suit, white shirt with French cuffs, black silk socks, black shoes, and a black-and-silver tie. I hope this doesn\u2019t inconvenience too many, but I would hate to look at color pictures of the head table and see some men in black tails and others in brown or blue suits!! Children at the Wedding or Reception: It is my wish, and also Z.\u2019s [the fianc\u00e9], that there be no children at the wedding ceremony or at the reception. For purposes of clarification, a child is anyone eighteen years or younger. There are many reasons for this request, but the best is the simple fact that I don\u2019t have the money to invite children who only pick at their food, cry, run around, etc. One friend of mine, who married about a year ago, says that when she got her wedding pictures back, there wasn\u2019t one that didn\u2019t have a kid in it and she was disgusted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, children are great. But there is a time and a place for them and this isn\u2019t it. This is an adult, ultra-formal affair and I want to keep it that way. One point of etiquette: When a formal invitation is sent out with Mr. and Mrs. Paul J. Smith on the outside envelope and Mr. and Mrs. Smith on the inside envelope, that is exactly what it means \u2014 only Mr. and Mrs. Smith are being invited and no one else; no others in the family, no guests who might be visiting at the time, etc. If asked about guests, you can \u201cdiplomatically\u201d pass this on. I know it sounds like I am being a real fusspot, but I would hate to tell each of you what the cost is per person just for the reception alone. I\u2019m doing this for my friends and relatives, for all of us to have a good time, but since there are only so many hours in the day, and I already have three jobs, and I am not a Vanderbilt, some lines must be drawn, and I hope everyone understands. I\u2019ve never wanted a small country-type wedding \u2014 Z. says this is no wedding but rather a coronation!! Well, not quite. But it sure has been fun so far, and I just cannot wait for everyone to arrive and for all our friends and relatives to have one great, fabulous night. Everyone think positive and keep your fingers crossed. Pray \u2014 that will bring more help. Won\u2019t each of you come with Z. and me to fantasyland \u2014 a place where dreams come true and fun abounds for everyone? Where the bride is Cinderella and the groom is Cinderfella for an evening. You are going to attend a ball at \u201cBuckingham Palace\u201d (pretend) and the King and Queen have invited only \u201croyalty\u201d \u2014 YOU! This will be a time to remember when you were courting the person to whom you are now married-a time to take a second honeymoon. We want everyone to be as happy as we are and to rekindle (add extra \u201cfire\u201d to) their own marriages. If you have a happy marriage now (which I know you all do), we expect the Palace to be really electrified with all that LOVE. May your every dream come true!","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4864}

These are the symptoms for the common cold, but they don\u2019t rule out Covid-19. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose. Some Covid-19 patients do get pneumonia, and one of the symptoms is a dry cough. A runny nose doesn\u2019t rule out Covid-19. The new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of 26\/27 degrees. It hates the Sun. There\u2019s no evidence for this. There\u2019s evidence that similar viruses transmit less well in the heat, but many countries with reported Covid-19 cases are experiencing temperatures higher than this. If someone with the new coronavirus sneezes, it travels about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. Environmental factors impact how far droplets from a sneeze can travel, but it is likely to be several metres. If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours - so if you come into contact with any metal surface - wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap. It\u2019s not yet known exactly how long the virus survives on surfaces. It can survive for 6-12 hours on fabric and will be killed by normal laundry detergent . There\u2019s no evidence the virus can survive in clothing and be transmitted this way. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. There\u2019s no evidence that the temperature of liquids consumed can protect you from viruses. Wash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes. There is no evidence yet on how long the virus can survive on the skin. But it is important to regularly wash your hands. You should gargle as a prevention with salt in warm water. There\u2019s no evidence this will prevent or cure the virus. Covid-19 starts with a sore throat lasting 3-4 days. It then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and the lungs, causing pneumonia, which takes about 5 or 6 days. With pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty breathing. The nasal congestion makes you feel like you\u2019re drowning. This is a roughly accurate description of the most common symptoms, although not everyone with Covid-19 gets pneumonia. The symptoms may not come in this order or at these times. There have been no reports of sufferers experiencing nasal congestion that makes them feel they are drowning.

{"claim_id":"36227","hypothesis":"Breastmilk effectively treats many conditions, including abrasions, cuts, insect bites, diaper rash, eczema, acne, and burns.","explanation_1":"Can You Use Breastmilk Topically to Treat Various Conditions?","premise":"In August 2018, a\u00a0post\u00a0from \u201cParents R Us\u201d about topical use of breastmilk to treat various conditions (archived here) appeared and has made the rounds online since, showing claims that have long been around in other forms as advice shared between parents:Underneath a photograph of a ziplock bag full of breastmilk in syringes, a post claimed:here are some facts for youDid you know that 1 drop of breastmilk has 1 million white blood cells? Original post by: Chelsea Leigh Ward You can use breastmilk topically to treat the following: Ear infections Some eye infections (Please note, never in the eye, but put it our around the eye) Bug bites Cuts Diaper rash Acne Eczema Burns CongestionThe list goes on and on, it\u2019s literally liquid gold! Here\u2019s my little life hack for when you need just a little bit of milk and don\u2019t want to thaw out an entire bag! **please consult your doctor to see if this is an option for you or your baby**After stating that \u201cone drop\u201d of breastmilk contains a million white blood cells, the post lists off a number of minor topical ailments for which the substance is supposedly an effective treatment. A slightly more specific but unsourced claim that one milliliter of breastmilk contains between one and five million \u201cwhite blood cells\u201d appears on two blogs, but is otherwise unsourced. Both Medela (a breastfeeding supply company) and a 2018 paper note that there are \u201cmillions\u201d of cells in breast milk (not in just\u00a0one drop), and that some are white blood cells.One study determined that the composition of breastmilk changes over time, concluding that it varies and depends on various intertwined issues, such as \u201cstage of lactation, the degree of breast fullness, infant feeding, the mother and infant health status, and many other factors and may be associated with the maternal diet and environment, and potentially with genetic factors.\u201d It cited concentrations well below the \u201cone to five million per drop\u201d estimate, though, with respect to a type of cell known as a leukocyte:The stage of lactation is associated with major changes in milk leukocyte composition . Using multicolor flow cytometry to identify and quantify leukocyte subsets in breast milk obtained from healthy women, Trend et al. found that colostrum contains approximately 146,000 cells\/ml and that the amount decreases in transitional (8\u201312 day postpartum) and mature milk (26\u201330 day postpartum) to 27,500 and 23,650 cells\/ml, respectively . They also demonstrated that breast milk contains a greater variety and complexity of leukocyte subsets than previously thought.Similar ranges were cited in a separate study. Colostrum, which is only expressed for a brief period after birth, was found to have far higher concentrations of such cells than transitional milk. A similar study in 2018 noted that ingested white cells did survive infants\u2019 gastric systems and remained active for up to six days.The broader post was about the use of breastmilk as a topical treatment. A 2018 Parents.com article about topical uses for breastmilk opens by claiming that the antibacterial properties of breastmilk have been proven, but it links to a study about ingested breastmilk rather than topical applications. When infection was mentioned in that research, it referred to breastfed infants and consumption of breastmilk.Parents.com\u2019s list of six topical uses for breastmilk cites a midwife and lactation consultant as its source, and both professions are known to recommend the use of breastmilk for ailments like maternal mastitis or cradle cap in infants. Of the six conditions mentioned in the article, only one (diaper rash) involved links to research. The site linked to a summary of a small study in 2015 finding breastmilk to be as efficient as hydrocortizone in treatment of diaper rash, and similar research supporting the same conclusion in 2013.The 2015 research found breastmilk to perform slightly better than ointment, and it cited earlier research on topical use of breastmilk for umbilical cord separation sites [PDF] as well as maternal mastitis:The frequency of healed infants was 81.5% and 76% in HBM and 1% hydrocortisone groups on day 21 respectively \u2026 Pishva et al. indicated the topical application of HBM as having beneficial effects on the prevention of neonatal conjunctivitis. Mohammadzadeh et al. showed the therapeutic effect of HBM and lanolin on sore nipples. HBM was found to heal nipples faster than using lanolin.Ahmadpour and his colleagues compared the effects of topical HBM to ethyl alcohol 96%, dry care, and silver sulfadiazine groups on the umbilical cord separation time. They showed that the mean cord separation time in the HBM group was significantly shorter than the other groups.A broader meta-study on the topical uses of breastmilk was published in May 2019. In its concluding paragraphs, researchers noted \u201cconsiderable\u00a0heterogeneity\u201d in the studies, meaning that their parameters were diverse enough to make it difficult to draw conclusions. They added that the most reliable clinical studies for assessing the benefits of breastmilk are \u201crandomized, double-blinded, multicenter controlled trials but to date, they are very scarce.\u201dIts authors also listed the pros for topical application of breastmilk (cost, convenience, and low risk of side effects) with the cons (poorly demonstrated efficacy as a whole) and a significant number of variables (conflicting outcomes and inconsistencies in breastmilk overall):Common skin problems may appear during lactation and breastfeeding, particularly affecting the nipple, areola, and breast. Some medications used in the treatment of skin conditions are unsuitable during lactation. It has been shown that expressing a few drops of milk and rubbing them gently into the sore nipples, then allowing it to dry naturally, takes advantage of the healing properties of human milk. Many studies have indicated that bioactive components of human milk and microbiota have promise as adjuvants for wound healing. From lesions of the corneal epithelium to lacerations of the skin, milk-treated groups healed faster than controls.Breast milk is used in many cultures for skin irritations. Breast milk involves no risk of allergy, contains antibodies, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and erythropoietin, which may promote the growth and repair of skin cells. Human milk is a source of commensal bacteria that can play an anti-infectious, immunomodulatory role. Their possible function in the acceleration of conditions for skin biofilm formation can open new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of skin and wound healing diseases. Interestingly, the analysis of Simpson et al. showed that miRNAs are possible mediators of the observed preventative effects of atopic dermatitis.The concentration, regulation, and individual variation between bioactive element, immune factors, various progenitor and mature cell types, and stage of lactation are not well established. Complexity and variability in human milk composition, and infants\u2019 responses to many human milk constituents may also explain some of the conflicting results of studies evaluating the effects of non-nutritional uses of human milk.The studies considered here vary in methodology and in definition of outcomes, which leads to considerable heterogeneity. Human milk composition varies both within and between individuals, and this may partially explain the conflicting data.The Facebook post touting the efficacy of breastmilk as a topical treatment racked up several tens of thousands of shares, a testament to its popularity as folk medicine. In recent years, numerous studies have attempted to determine whether those claims were provable, with limited success. Variations in breastmilk and study outcomes have not yet shown breastmilk to be a substitute for more conventional topical treatments, although it has demonstrated some use in applications for skin conditions like diaper rash. Consulting a doctor before eschewing standard treatment is advisable \u2014 although breastmilk in and of itself is not likely to pose much risk to the nursing infant or their mother.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":1462}

It is the economy.\u201d","explanation_1":"A TikTok video said skyrocketing unemployment is killing people, not the coronavirus. The researcher whose work lies behind the stat in the video said that\u2019s a complete misreading of his results. The link between recessions and future deaths is complicated, and the unprecedented current crisis makes predictions even harder.","premise":"\"A TikTok post is proof that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. In the video, Steven Baker, an Idaho chiropractor and self-defined \"\"expert in healing,\"\" argued that the tens of thousands of deaths the country is witnessing don\u2019t come from the coronavirus. They come from the shutdown. \"\"The economy is what\u2019s killing people,\"\" Baker said in his April 23 video. \"\"Homicide, suicide, heart attacks, mental health institutions, alcoholism, drug use. That\u2019s called deaths of despair.\"\" Baker cited a stat that when unemployment goes up 1%, deaths of despair go up 58,000 over five years. And he noted that unemployment now is through the roof. At the end of his piece, he doubled down on his key point. \"\"It\u2019s not the coronavirus that\u2019s killing people. It is the economy. Way more people are dying because of the economy and unemployment than will ever be killed by coronavirus.\"\" We reached Baker, and when we explained the underlying research to him, he acknowledged that the numbers didn\u2019t add up. \"\"I admit, I was wrong,\"\" Baker said. He said he heard the 58,000 figure from a reliable source, and added, \"\"this virus is a lot less dangerous than people think it is.\"\" Since an extended economic downturn can cause some kinds of deaths to rise, and there are more and more warnings about that, it\u2019s worth a moment to unpack what the real research shows. We\u2019ll start with the researcher whose work, indirectly, lies behind Baker\u2019s central argument. More than four decades ago, in a report for the congressional Joint Economic Committee, medical sociologist Harvey Brenner assessed the impact of sustained unemployment. Brenner found that in a five-year period, a 1.4% rise in unemployment added about 30,000 deaths due to suicides (1,540), homicides (1,740), liver disease (870) and cardiovascular\/kidney disease (26,440). Factoring in America\u2019s growing population, a recent opinion piece estimated the added deaths to be 58,000. That piece, citing Brenner, was the source of Baker\u2019s claim. But Brenner, now a professor at the University of North Texas, described how the video fundamentally misused his work. Brenner said his work is about \"\"the permanent loss of jobs,\"\" not an immediate rise in unemployment, no matter how dramatic. The deaths he identified started two years after a sustained economic downturn. \"\"It is not now statistically possible to render a verdict on the economy-based mortality implications of the immediate downturn of the past two months,\"\" Brenner said. \"\"Baker\u2019s video is not factually correct.\"\" Baker builds his entire case on Brenner\u2019s findings. But over the decades, other researchers have cast doubt on Brenner\u2019s core conclusion, some going so far as to say he got things upside down. There are deaths of despair, said Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They wrote a New York Times bestseller \"\"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism.\"\" The deaths primarily were among less educated white Americans and started in the 1990s. \"\"They rose before the Great Recession, they grew during the Great Recession and they grew after the Great Recession,\"\" Case and Deaton wrote in a recent op-ed. \"\"The line of rising deaths shows no perceptible effect of the collapse of the economy.\"\" Case and Deaton point to Spain and Greece as the poster children of the beneficial effects of recession. \"\"Unemployment in Greece and Spain more than tripled, to the point where more than a quarter of the population was unemployed,\"\" they wrote. \"\"Yet Greece and Spain saw increases in life expectancy that were among the best in Europe.\"\" As counterintuitive as it might sound, mortality from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. typically falls during a downturn, as Christopher Ruhm, a University of Virginia economist found. One study reported that in a lackluster economy, people exercise more and smoke less. That\u2019s particularly telling, since heart related deaths were a huge factor in Brenner\u2019s total. Ruhm cautions, though, that the tie between the economy and any given disease is complex and changeable. The reduction in heart disease deaths seen in decades past was not as strong in recent years and might give way further in the current crisis if fear of the virus keeps people from seeking treatment. Still, he called the statistics in Baker\u2019s video \"\"silly.\"\" Ruhm\u2019s overarching warning is that the country is in new territory. \"\"The fundamental fact is that we can\u2019t extrapolate from the recent past to understand the effects of the coronavirus,\"\" he said. \"\"The nature and magnitude of the effects are just too different from past experience.\"\" And as he and other researchers have noted, if the country hadn\u2019t moved to stop the spread of COVID-19, deaths would have mounted astronomically \u2014 which would have brought economic devastation in its own right. A TikTok user said it\u2019s the economic downturn, not the coronavirus, \"\"that\u2019s killing people.\"\" He brought up the statistic that a 1% rise in unemployment causes 58,000 additional deaths over five years, due to heart attacks, drug abuse and other \"\"diseases of despair.\"\" The researcher whose work lies behind that statistic said it doesn\u2019t apply and that he has no question that current deaths, now over 80,000, stem from the virus. No analyst said the immediate scale of deaths could be tied to rising unemployment.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":5450}

It would be easier to accept NASA\u2019s official explanation if they were not so secretive about everything they study and do in space \u2013 but one thing is for certain \u2013 NASA\u2019s own personnel have admitted that lithium, along with other chemicals, are intentionally being placed into our environment regularly. It is possible that many of NASA\u2019s own employees aren\u2019t even aware of the true motivations for carrying out such a project, ironically displaying the very behaviors that these chemicals\/pharmaceuticals are meant to instill. In the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ([redacted]@nasa.gov) admits that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere, and says that it is \u201charmless to the environment.\u201d NASA Confesses to Thoughts on this? \ud83d\udc49 Dosing Americans with Air-borne Lithium & Other Chemicals AnonHQ https:\/\/t.co\/zfElekED5a \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 19, 2016  The article then\u00a0launched into assigning of purported motives for dosing Americans with lithium, a potent anti-manic psychiatric\u00a0medication. From there, the article made its case for the existence of a NASA lithium spraying\u00a0program (without any citations,\u00a0and bearing a strong similarity to a\u00a0previous\u00a0hoax): It is very real, and there is ample scientific documentation to corroborate what I put forth here: A Pub Med abstract titled, Feasibility of Aerosol Vaccinations in Humans discusses how an increase in antigen volumes can be beneficial in aerosol delivery of vaccines, and could be used in \u201cdeveloping countries and disaster areas.\u201d The abstract also admits that several thousand human subjects have already been aerosol vaccinated with live attenuated measles and influenza A vaccines. The executive summary further states that aerosol vaccinations are ideal for \u201clarge populations.\u201d This has apparently been happening since as early as 2003. Another discussion of aerosolized vaccinations can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine. A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Aerosolized Vaccines Against Measles states that these vaccines were tested on children in India that were as young 9 months old. The World Health Organization has been researching aerosol vaccines for years now, as have \u201cphilanthropic\u201d agencies which have clear aims to sterilize the population. It is also worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry has been absolved from any legal responsibility for medicating the masses since they were awarded legal protection from all lawsuits by Congress in 1986. This law was challenged, but upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. Many powerful agencies are making sure that we \u201ctake our medicine.\u201d In fact, many nations are participating in our unwitting, forced vaccination, and the dumping of any number of attenuated viruses, chemical concoctions and other \u2018chemtrails\u2019 on our heads with dogged frequency. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) considered giving a license application to PaxVax Australia (PaxVax) for the intentional release of a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into the environment in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. They planned to release cholera on their people. According to the regulator, this GMO vaccine qualified as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000. Of course, we can\u2019t ignore the USA. Michael Greenwood wrote an article stating that: \u201cThe incidence of human West Nile virus cases can be significantly reduced through large\u2013scale aerial spraying that targets adult mosquitoes, according to research by the Yale School of Public Health and the California Department of Public Health.\u201d Buried among the tinfoil were a few actual facts:\u00a0that 2003 study\u00a0does exist, but it studied aerosolized vaccines \u2014 i.e. ones that are inhaled as opposed to injected \u2014 and had nothing to do with dropping chemicals from planes. Another unrelated piece of \u201cproof\u201d offered up by the author was the widespread and well-documented efforts to combat the spread of West Nile virus by spraying\u00a0insecticide,\u00a0initiatives that targeted mosquitos, not humans. The excerpt also referenced \u201cGMO vaccines,\u201d a term we were unable to\u00a0even define (a\u00a01998 paper speculated on the promise\u00a0of \u201cgenetically engineered vaccines\u201d). Also included was a video titled \u201cNASA admits chemtrails,\u201d published to YouTube on 13 July 2013 (and purportedly recorded three days earlier):  The clip\u00a0(which had no video component, only audio) was purported to be\u00a0a recorded phone call between a woman identified only as \u201cSue\u201d and NASA astrophysicist\u00a0Douglas Rowland. \u201cSue\u201d brought up\u00a0a\u00a0video she watched in which lithium was mentioned, and the exchange that followed illustrated how the caller and the NASA scientist were carrying\u00a0on entirely separate conversations. Sue\u00a0fixated on the use of the word \u201clithium\u201d as Rowland tried\u00a0to explain NASA\u2019s study of the upper atmosphere, and why conditions\u00a0there differed from those\u00a0at lower altitudes: Sue: When the article came out in the major newspapers including The Huffington Post there was no mention of lithium, not one. Not one mention of lithium until I heard the recording of the actual \u2026 I \u2026 listened to the rockets go off. I had no idea there was going to be a lithium dispersed until I heard \u2018Payload \u2026 lithium \u2026 dispersed.\u2019\u201d Rowland: Right, there was lithium dispersed and I\u2019d be happy to talk about it. I think you may be under so misconceptions about what we\u2019re doing, but I\u2019m happy to tell you any details that you need. Sue: It says in your article that you\u2019re doing it for communications. Rowland: There are many reasons we\u2019re doing it because we don\u2019t understand how the wind in the upper atmosphere moves. Chemtrails \u2026 there are different kinds of chemtrails. Different trails at night. We use different trails during the day. The wind blows them around. They glow either on their own or from scattered sunlight. We take pictures and we can see how the wind trail moves around. It\u2019s just like if you were taking a picture of an airplane contrail. You could use that to see how the wind was blowing. This is much higher altitude so we use these chemical trails. Sue: What is the purpose of knowing what the wind\u2019s going to do in the ionosphere? Rowland: The purpose is really to understand our planet. It\u2019s very fundamental science. Every day we know there is electrical current that flow over the head that is naturally there. They have been there ever since the Earth had an atmosphere and electrical field. And the wind is driven by the sun. The sun heats the atmosphere, the wind blows and every day that wind drives an electric current and we\u2019re trying to understand what causes that. Simply how does it work in detail, and also importantly when the sun becomes active with lots of sun spots and lots of magnetic activity that changes the wind pattern and changes the electric current. We want to understand both what it is on a regular day when there is no solar activity and then what it is when there is a lot of solar activity. Sue: Is there some other way you can do it without dispersing the lithium? Rowland: We\u2019re researching other ways. The lithium is actually harmless to the environment and we can show you more about that but it is tricky to use because it\u2019s very faint. You can\u2019t see it with your naked eye. You have to have special cameras to see it so we don\u2019t like to use it for that reason. It\u2019s hard measurement to make. We\u2019re researching other ways to put censors directly on the rocket to measure the wind and those are ongoing. We\u2019re trying to develop them now and one of the purposes of this mission was to do that. Between incorrectly framed data about unrelated studies of mass vaccination or West Nile virus spraying and the video,\u00a0AnonHQ concluded that \u201chopefully we\u2019ve established that this IS happening,\u201d when neither the article nor video had established any\u00a0such thing. What actually transpired was folks\u00a0(one of whom harassed a NASA scientist and encouraged others to do the same) misinterpreted\u00a0publicized\u00a0scientific research to\u00a0fit a pre-existing conspiracy theory. In the conversation between Rowland and Sue (during which portions were clearly elided) the only admissions made were those about the detail of upper atmosphere study, already publicly disclosed on a regular basis by NASA and linked in this article. The use of lithium in such research was neither\u00a0a\u00a0secret nor\u00a0cause for concern. NASA published an article\u00a0in January 2013 explaining its purpose, one of many highlighting projects of the nature Rowland discussed: NASA successfully launched a Terrier-Improved Orion suborbital rocket at 5:50 p.m. EST this evening from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. During the flight, two red-colored lithium vapor trails were produced. Reports from those viewing the launch or vapor trails came from as far away as the Outer Banks, N.C.; eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Two different methods for creating the lithium vapor were tested to determine which configuration is best for observing various science phenomena in space. NASA has two missions later this year that will use lithium trails to assist scientists in observing events in space \u2026 In the technology test launch, two canisters in the rocket\u2019s payload section contained solid metal lithium rods or chips embedded in a thermite cake. The thermite was ignited and produced heat to vaporize the lithium. The vapor was released in space to be detected and tracked optically. The lithium combustion process posed no threat to the public during the release in space. When heated, the lithium rods change to lithium vapor and small amounts of lithium oxide. The thermite reaction produces iron and aluminum oxide. NASA similarly reported the same sort of research\u00a0in\u00a0July 2011, in an\u00a0openly-available article\u00a0about the observation of\u00a0lithium trails in the upper atmosphere: The rockets \u2014 known as sounding rockets from the nautical term \u201cto sound,\u201d meaning to measure \u2014 will launch sometime between July 5 and 23 depending on ionospheric and weather conditions. NASA\u2019s sounding rocket program at Wallops dates back to the agency\u2019s inception in 1958. Not only do sounding rockets offer a low cost way to access space, they also provide access to areas of the atmosphere too low for satellites. In this experiment, the scientists will fly two pair of rockets. One in each pair will measure data about the charged or \u201cionized\u201d gas \u2014 called plasma \u2014 as well as the neutral gas, through which it travels. The other will shoot out a long trail of lithium gas to track the wind movement. The instrumented rockets are 40 feet long and 17 inches in diameter, carrying a payload of 600 lbs. The lithium rockets are 14 inches in diameter and are about six feet long. Beginning July 5, the team will set up each day from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. EDT, ready to launch as soon as there\u2019s evidence of currents in the ionosphere as well as a crystal clear skies \u2013 necessary for successful observation of the lithium trail. With all the focus conspiracy sites placed on NASA, none appeared to discover the agency\u2019s explanation of purpose for lithium in rocket launches (published in 1958 and available freely on the agency\u2019s web site): Chemical propellants in common use deliver specific impulse values ranging from about 175 up to about 300 seconds. The most energetic chemical propellants are theoretically capable of specific impulses up to about 400 seconds. High values of specific impulse are obtained from high exhaust-gas temperature, and from exhaust gas having very low (molecular) weight. To be efficient, therefore, a propellant should have a large heat of combustion to yield high temperatures, and should produce combustion products containing simple, light molecules embodying such elements as hydrogen (the lightest), carbon, oxygen, fluorine, and the lighter metals (aluminum, beryllium, lithium) \u2026 Devices such as the nuclear rocket must use some chemical as a working fluid or propellant, although no energy is supplied to the rocket by any chemical reaction \u2026 Propellants that would be suitable for use in electric propulsion devices are the easily ionized metals. The one most generally considered is cesium; next best are rubidium, potassium, sodium, and lithium. On 21 April 2016, we spoke with both Rowland and NASA\u2019s Keith Koehler. Koehler confirmed that the tracer rockets in question operated at far higher altitudes than commercial aircraft (chemtrail conspiracies focus on lower altitudes). Koehler explained why vapor tracers were\u00a0necessary to measure atmospheric conditions: Vapor tracers used in NASA suborbital rocket missions allow scientist to see that which is not visible to the naked eye. They are used to measure atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere, typically between 50 and 248 miles altitude (Commercial aircraft fly around six miles altitude.). The vapor is released along a portion of the rocket trajectory. The small amount of vapor is then visible from the ground. By tracking their motions directly with cameras on the ground (or in an airplane), these tracers make it possible to observe the movements of the upper atmosphere or the ionosphere directly. The purpose of the measurements is to understand how the natural upper atmospheric winds and\/or ion drifts behave, not to change them. The releases would therefore have little value if they were changing the behavior of the upper atmosphere or ionosphere. The tracers are released in a part of the atmosphere where meteors from space deposit 100 to 200 tons of metallic material every day across the globe compared to a one-pound tracer release, for example. The meteors contain the same types of metallic material used in the tracers.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":2473}

Nothing passed due to the gridlock over that issue. As for the statement about Rubio\u2019s voting record.\"","premise":"\"As the number of Floridians infected with the Zika virus continues to escalate, political groups and and candidates have lobbed attacks in the U.S. Senate battle in Florida. NARAL Pro-Choice America, a liberal organization that supports abortion rights, attacked Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s record on Zika in an ad airing on TV in Orlando and West Palm Beach and online. NARAL endorsed Rubio\u2019s opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter. \"\"The Zika virus is here. It\u2019s dangerous to pregnant women. And it has no cure. But Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency,\"\" states the narrator while text states that Rubio \"\"voted against contraception and family planning.\"\" The narrator then continues: \"\"And Marco Rubio continues to be against a woman's right to choose an abortion even if they are infected with the Zika virus.\"\" The ad shows video of someone clad in protective gear spraying for mosquitoes and anxious looking women including one who is pregnant. The ad began airing as Congress returned from recess to debate Zika funding again. On Sept. 6, a Senate bill failed to receive the necessary votes to move forward. We will zero in on Rubio\u2019s votes related to Zika. Rubio\u2019s voting record and public statements about Zika show that he has repeatedly shown support for Zika funding requests, including by President Barack Obama. The ad is referring to Rubio\u2019s votes in favor of Zika legislation that would have cut funding to one organization in Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Planned Parenthood. Zika bills In February, Obama requested $1.9 billion for vaccine research, testing and mosquito control related to Zika. Rubio announced his support for Obama\u2019s request at a press conference in Miami April 8. A timeline from Rubio\u2019s office states he was the first congressional Republican to announce his support. Since that time, Rubio has repeatedly called on his colleagues in floor speeches, media outlets and press conferences to pass a bill. On May 12, Rubio and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, announced they would introduce legislation to provide the full $1.9 billion request. \"\"There's no reason every proposal to address Zika cannot be bipartisan and earn broad support, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final outcome that fully addresses the problem,\"\" Rubio said at the time. On May 17, Rubio voted with the majority, 68-29, for a motion on an amendment by \u00a0Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.,\u00a0and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to provide $1.1 billion to combat Zika. Rubio reluctantly\u00a0voted for the compromise measure while still calling for Obama\u2019s full funding request. Two days later, the Senate passed the full bill 89-8 with Rubio voting with the majority. The bill called for spending $1.1 billion to prevent, prepare and respond to the Zika virus domestically and internationally including on the development of a vaccine. House and Senate negotiators then got together in a conference committee. Republicans added a clause to block any money for Profamilias, the Puerto Rican branch of Planned Parenthood. The services of that family planning agency are relevant here because Zika can be transmitted through sex, and condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika. Profamilias served 8,000 people in 2015. Democrats saw that as a \"\"poison pill\"\" intended to doom the bill, while Republicans said Democrats were refusing to compromise. While the bill would have blocked funding for Profamilias, it would not have blocked funding for Puerto Rico entirely. The ad omits that the bill provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island. Puerto Rico has 20 community health centers operating at 84 sites. Profamilias has seven clinics on the island, and in each area there is another type of facility that would have been eligible for Zika funding. The ad cites two Rubio votes in June on the appropriations bill that included the $1.1 billion for Zika. The first vote, on June 14, was a motion to proceed and passed 94-3. So NARAL is attacking Rubio for voting in favor of something that was supported by virtually every senator of both parties. The second vote was on June 28 when the Senate voted 52-48 to bring up the Zika measure. It failed to reach the 60-vote threshold, so the underlying bill didn\u2019t reach an up or down vote. Rubio voted for the measure. \"\"Shame on Washington for failing to pass Zika funding,\"\" Rubio said after the bill died. \"\"We\u2019ve been on top of this issue for five months, and it\u2019s a failure of both parties in this town, including the president of the United States, that it\u2019s taken this long to even get to this point.\"\" One final note about the ad\u2019s attack on Rubio for opposing abortion, including for women with Zika. Rubio told Politico in August: \"\"I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.\"\" Our ruling NARAL\u2019s TV ad said, \"\"Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika).\"\" The text on the screen stated that Rubio \"\"voted against contraception and family planning.\"\" The ad creates a misleading impression that Rubio\u2019s votes show he is indifferent to funding clinics to combat Zika.

{"claim_id":"35548","hypothesis":"A graphic shows contradictory CNN articles about hydroxychloroquine, published three months apart and co-authored by the same person.","explanation_1":"\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of loosey-goosiness here in all this,\u201d he told CNN.","premise":"One of the many political controversies surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 was U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated touting of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for treatment of the coronavirus disease, despite a lack of scientific studies and evidence demonstrating its effectiveness for that purpose. One item that circulated on social media played on that controversy by purporting to show two seemingly contradictory CNN articles about hydroxychloroquine, published three months apart and co-authored by the same person. One criticized Trump for being \u201cwrong\u201d about hydroxychloroquine, and the other acknowledged that a study had found hydroxychloroquine helpful in treating coronavirus patients:  However, these articles were not contradictory in content, and they were presented in a misleading manner in the above example to make them seem so. The first article, published on April 11, 2020, and written by Elizabeth Cohen and Dr. Minali Nigam, was headlined \u201cPresident Trump is wrong in so many ways about hydroxychloroquine studies. Here are the facts.\u201d This article did not assert that hydroxychloroquine had no value whatsoever as a treatment for the coronavirus disease. Rather, it pointed out four specific ways in which Trump had made claims about hydroxychloroquine studies that were contrary to what doctors were expressing about the subject at the time: 1) How soon until we know if hydroxychloroquine works against coronavirus? Trump says \u201cdays.\u201d Doctors say weeks or months. 2) French researchers have already done a clinical study showing hydroxychloroquine works as a treatment for coronavirus. Doesn\u2019t that tell us something? Trump says yes. Doctors say the study was terrible, so no. 3) Have some people tried to delay hydroxychloroquine clinical trials? Trump says yes, and he came to the rescue. Doctors say they have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. 4) Is hydroxychloroquine safe for coronavirus patients? Trump says yes. Doctors say the drug can have serious side effects. The second article, published on July 3 2020, and written by Maggie Fox, Andrea Kane, and Elizabeth Cohen, had its headline deceptively truncated in the above example to remove the skepticism it expressed about a recent hydroxychloroquine study. The full headline read \u201cStudy finds hydroxychloroquine may have boosted survival, but other researchers have doubts,\u201d and the text of the article detailed the dispute over the study\u2019s findings: A surprising new study found the controversial antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine helped patients better survive in the hospital. But the findings, like the federal government\u2019s use of the drug itself, were disputed. A team at Henry Ford Health System in southeast Michigan said their study of 2,541 hospitalized patients found that those given hydroxychloroquine were much less likely to die. t\u2019s a surprising finding because several other studies have found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine, a drug originally developed to treat and prevent malaria. President Donald Trump touted the drug heavily, but later studies found not only did patients not do better if they got the drug, they were more likely to suffer cardiac side effects. Researchers not involved in the Henry Ford study pointed out it wasn\u2019t of the same quality of the studies showing hydroxychloroquine did not help patients, and said other treatments, such as the use of the steroid dexamethasone, might have accounted for the better survival of some patients \u2026 They noted that the Henry Ford team did not randomly treat patients but selected them for various treatments based on certain criteria. [Eli Rosenberg, associate professor of epidemiology at the University at Albany School of Public Health] also pointed out that the Detroit paper excluded 267 patients \u2014 nearly 10% of the study population \u2014 who had not yet been discharged from the hospital. He said this might have skewed the results to make hydroxychloroquine look better than it really was. Those patients might have still been in the hospital because they were very sick, and if they died, excluding them from the study made hydroxychloroquine look like more of a lifesaver than it really was.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":7766}
{"claim_id":"26840","hypothesis":"Bloomberg says he wants to ban guns holding more than three rounds.","explanation_1":"U.S. states filed a lawsuit accusing Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc of orchestrating a sweeping scheme with 19 other drug companies to inflate drug prices - sometimes by more than 1,000% - and stifle competition for generic drugs, state prosecutors said on Saturday.","premise":"Soaring drug prices from both branded and generic manufacturers have sparked outrage and investigations in the United States. The criticism has come from across the political spectrum, from President Donald Trump, a Republican, to progressive Democrats including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president. The 20 drug companies engaged in illegal conspiracies to divide up the market for drugs to avoid competing and, in some cases, conspired to either prevent prices from dropping or to raise them, according to the complaint by 44 U.S. states, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court in  Connecticut. A representative of Teva USA, a unit of Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, said it will fight the lawsuit. \u201cThe allegations in this new complaint, and in the litigation more generally, are just that \u2013 allegations,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cTeva continues to review the issue internally and has not engaged in any conduct that would lead to civil or criminal liability.\u201d  The 500-page lawsuit accuses the generic drug industry, which mainly sells medicines that are off patent and should be less expensive, of a long history of discreet agreements to ensure that companies that are supposedly competitors each get a \u201cfair share.\u201d  The situation worsened in 2012, the complaint said. \u201cApparently unsatisfied with the status quo of \u2018fair share\u2019  and the mere avoidance of price erosion, Teva and its co-conspirators embarked on one of the most egregious and damaging  price-fixing conspiracies in the history of the United States,\u201d the complaint said. With Teva at the center of the conspiracy, the drug companies colluded to significantly raise prices on 86 medicines between July 2013 and January 2015, the complaint said. Representatives of Sandoz, another company named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The drugs included everything from tablets and capsules to creams and ointments to treat conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy and more, they said. In some instances, the coordinated price increases were more than 1,000 percent, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit also names 15 individuals as defendants who it said carried out the schemes on a day-to-day basis. \u201cThe level of corporate greed alleged in this multistate lawsuit is heartless and unconscionable,\u201d Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak said in a statement. According to New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, more than half of the corporate defendants are based in New Jersey, and five of the individual defendants live in the state. The lawsuit seeks damages, civil penalties and actions by the court to restore competition to the generic drug market. Generic drugs can save drug buyers and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year because they are a lower-priced alternative to brand-name drugs. \u201cGeneric drugs were one of the few \u2018bargains\u2019 in the United States healthcare system,\u201d the lawsuit said. However, it added, \u201cPrices for hundreds of generic drugs have risen \u2013 while some have skyrocketed, without explanation, sparking outrage from politicians, payers and consumers across the country whose costs have doubled, tripled, or even increased 1,000% or more.\u201d  As a result of the drug companies\u2019 conspiracies, it said, consumers and states paid \u201csubstantially inflated and anticompetitive prices for numerous generic pharmaceutical drugs\u201d while the drug companies profited. The lawsuit filed on Friday is parallel to an action brought in December 2016 by the attorneys general of 45 states and the District of Columbia. That case was later expanded to include more than a dozen drugmakers.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":2664}

An unnamed administration official implied that signature strikes would eventually be phased out, though without any details. In any case, the drone program in Pakistan, which killed the hostages, was generally exempt from these rules. Clarke\u2019s claim suggests that Obama did something he said he wouldn\u2019t do anymore, but that isn\u2019t the case.\"","premise":"\"The White House recently disclosed that the two hostages -- one American and one Italian -- were killed in January by an American \"\"signature strike\"\" aimed at al-Qaida terrorists. A signature strike is a type of drone strike, in which the United States targets people they believe to be militants, though they don\u2019t know the exact identity of the target. Some have criticized the government\u2019s use of such strikes because they run a higher risk of hitting innocent parties. Government officials told the Wall Street Journal that signature strikes have been effective for killing high-value targets, especially in regions where it\u2019s hard to locate al-Qaida leaders. But the continued use of signature strikes goes against what President Barack Obama said he was going to do, said ABC News security consultant Richard Clarke, who spent 30 years working in government, including 10 years in the White House, before leaving in 2003. \"\"When you do these signature strikes, meaning by definition, you don't know who you are killing, you just know the facility looks like an al-Qaida facility,\"\" Clarke said on ABC\u00a0This Week\u00a0April 27. \"\"When you do signature strikes, that's very risky. And President Obama said he was going to stop them, and clearly he didn't.\"\" Obama has relied heavily on drones -- nearly 2,500 people have been killed in covert drone strikes since Obama took office, according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism, which tracks strikes. We wondered if Obama had gone back on what he said. Did he say he was going to stop signature strikes? Vague guidelines Clarke didn\u2019t respond to several requests for comment. But we dug through Obama\u2019s statements over the years, as well as campaign materials. We couldn\u2019t find any instance in which Obama literally said he was going to stop using signature strikes. Clarke\u2019s claim might stem from a May 2013 speech Obama delivered at the National Defense University, where he discussed vague drone policies. In the speech, Obama announced that he had signed a \"\"presidential policy guidance\"\" document where he codified a \"\"framework that governs our use of force against terrorists.\"\" Although the event and document were widely seen as a shift to more restrictions on drone strikes, concrete details about the shift were almost nonexistent. The presidential policy guidance document itself is not publicly available, and the related fact sheet does not address drone strikes, much less signature strikes. A heckler in the audience asked specifically what Obama was planning to do about signature strikes, but he did not respond. An unnamed member of the Obama administration debriefed reporters on the shift, and one reporter asked, \"\"Will signature strikes explicitly be prohibited now?\"\" \"\"I don\u2019t want to get into the details of any specific strike,\"\" the official responded, though he went on to say \"\"the type of strikes we\u2019ve taken generally\"\" would eventually be phased out. \"\"Given the two principal changing circumstances in our effort against terrorism -- the winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the demise of al-Qaida core -- the need for the types of strikes that we\u2019ve taken generally over the course of the last several years will be reduced over time,\"\" the official said. (Obama has since extended the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.) Following the briefing, the New York Times reported that the codified standards \"\"could signal\"\" an end to signature strikes -- not that they would unequivocally. They also reported that officials said signature trikes would certainly continue in Pakistan, where the two men were killed. In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the CIA drone program in Pakistan is generally exempt from the 2013 policy guidelines, at least while the United States continues some level of operations in Afghanistan. At the time, Benjamin Wittes, a national security expert and editor of the Lawfare blog, wrote that it was unclear from Obama\u2019s remarks and the coverage whether or not Obama actually narrowed the criteria for targeting people in drone strikes -- because the language was so opaque. Now -- two years later -- Wittes told PolitiFact, \"\"I don't think it's fair to say that Obama promised to end signature strikes.\"\" Our ruling Clarke said, \"\"President Obama said he was going to stop (signature strikes).\"\" As far as we can tell, Obama has never said himself that he would stop signature drone strikes, which killed two western civilian hostages. An unnamed administration official implied that signature strikes would eventually be phased out, though without any details. In any case, the drone program in Pakistan, which killed the hostages, was generally exempt from these rules.

A: No. There\u2019s no evidence for that rumor, which has been spread on conservative websites. There is no evidence to substantiate an online rumor that Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, ever lodged a similar allegation against Justice Neil Gorsuch.Nevertheless, that claim has boomeranged across social media platforms and websites \u2014 creating an impression that Ford, the California professor whose story has\u00a0disrupted Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process, made repeated allegations in an effort to derail the confirmations of conservative Supreme Court picks.Gorsuch was confirmed in 2017 after being nominated by President Donald Trump.\u201cBREAKING: According to sources Diane Feinstein\u2019s reluctance to mention the Kavanaugh accuser\u2019s letter during confirmation session is because the accuser sent a similiar letter directed at Judge Gorsuch last year.

Active is currently awaiting trial on the May 2013 charges. The ad did not mention Active by name, but it gave a detailed description of the crime -- which received significant coverage in the Alaska media last year -- in front of the building where it occurred. The Sullivan campaign retaliated almost immediately with its own ad (in which they identify Active), defending his record and calling Begich\u2019s ad \"\"shameful.\"\" Both campaigns have pulled the videos down at the request of the victims\u2019 family, who claimed the ad was insensitive and could affect upcoming prosecution. (PolitiFact obtained a copy of the ad in order to fact-check it; a TV report in Alaska shows a clip of it.) Even though the ads are no longer on the Alaska airwaves, the skirmish points to serious criminal justice issues. So we decided to dig in and see if Sullivan bears any responsibility for Active\u2019s alleged crime. We found that the timing just doesn\u2019t line up. Doing time Begich\u2019s campaign declined to talk with us about the ad -- citing the pending trial -- so we asked the Alaska Democratic Party for evidence tying Sullivan to events leading to Active\u2019s sentencing and the May 2013 crime. The party pointed out that Sullivan was attorney general in March 2010, when prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement with Active, who at the time was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, among other charges. (Sullivan\u2019s name is stamped on the plea agreement, though it bears the signature of an assistant district attorney.) The Alaska Department of Law later found that Active\u2019s 2010 plea agreement was based on incorrect information and should have come with a longer sentence. If Active had received the longer sentence, he likely would have still been in jail on the day he committed the murders. But Sullivan is not personally responsible for this plea agreement mistake. Let\u2019s take a look at the course of events, according to the Department of Law. Keep in mind that Sullivan was attorney general from June 2009 to December 2010. In January 2009, state troopers arrested Active for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and then physically assaulting the girl\u2019s mother and brother. In March 2010, Active pled guilty to those charges, accepting a deal with prosecutors that sentenced him to about four years of jail time (including the time he had served up to that point, since his arrest in January 2009). Active was released in 2012. From then on, he was in and out of prison on probation violation charges until May 25, 2013, when he committed the murder referenced in Begich\u2019s ad. When drawing up Active\u2019s plea agreement in 2010, the state looked at his criminal history. As is customary, they received this information from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network. However, Active\u2019s report failed to identify a 2007 felony conviction for providing a minor with alcohol. (That\u2019s typically a misdemeanor, but Active\u2019s charge was treated as a felony due to some nuances in the law.) Because of the inaccurate report, the Department of Law miscalculated Active\u2019s presumptive sentence. They believed it to be between two years and 12 years -- leading to his four-year sentence and release in 2012. If their calculation had included his 2007 felony charge, he would have had a presumptive sentence of eight years to 15 years. The Department of Law said at the time that they are not sure how the mistake happened, though the information network sometimes has blind spots when it comes to offenses that happen in rural villages, like the one where Active was arrested in 2007, according to the Alaska Dispatch. Regardless, this chain of events happened before Sullivan became attorney general. The Alaska Public Safety Information Network pulled Active\u2019s report the day after he was arrested in January 2009 -- Sullivan took office the following June. So although Active\u2019s plea agreement and sentencing happened in 2010, while Sullivan was in office, the mistake that led to Active\u2019s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier. (At the time, Sullivan was on active duty for the U.S. Marine Corps, according to his campaign.) Additionally, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Sullivan was personally involved with Active\u2019s case and plea agreement at all, said John Skidmore, director of the Department of Law\u2019s criminal division. The state handles about 40,000 cases each year, at least half of which are felonies -- so it\u2019s \"\"unrealistic\"\" for an\u00a0attorney general to be involved with individual cases, he said. \"\"There is no way that (any attorney general) would be involved in that sort of decision at that level at that time,\"\" Skidmore said. Part of a trend? The Alaska Democrats said that under Sullivan, there was a trend of the state giving sex offenders light sentences -- pointing to a dozen cases in which Alaska prosecutors negotiated sentences with sex offenders that fell at the low end of the sentence-length spectrum. They also noted that Alaska local television station CBS 11 produced a story in March 2010 about what happens to criminals who fail to register as sex offenders with the state. The story includes examples of convicted rapists receiving the minimum sentence for failing to register, and others having charges against them dropped. However, Alaska\u2019s sentencing structure encourages prosecutors to negotiate sentencing agreements, leaving judges with little influence over sentencing, said former Alaska Chief Justice Walter Carpeneti in 2012. And these presumptive sentencing policies had been in place since the late 1970s -- so when Sullivan entered the office, these practices were already well-established. During his time as attorney general and subsequent role as commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan was one of the main faces of the \"\"Choose Respect\"\" campaign, started in 2009 by Republican Gov. Sean Parnell to address domestic violence and sexual assault in Alaska. The \"\"Choose Respect\"\" campaign passed several pieces of legislation while Sullivan was attorney general, which his campaign said exemplifies his commitment to the issue. The laws passed include harsher sentences for people involved with child pornography or human trafficking, revision of bail laws for people charged with serious crimes, and specified procedures for DNA retention in murder and sexual assault cases. The campaign also said Sullivan hired the Department of Law\u2019s first cyber-crimes prosecutor whose focus is combating child pornography. Following Active\u2019s arrest for the May 2013 crimes, the state changed its plea bargaining policies, so Alaska prosecutors are no longer permitted to negotiate lower sentences with people charged with violent felonies or sexual crimes. Our ruling Begich said Sullivan approved a \"\"light sentence\"\" to a sex offender who is now charged with \"\"murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter.\"\" Active, who is awaiting trial, received a shorter sentence than he was supposed to, but the mistake that led to this sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general. So to pin the error on Sullivan is wrong, and to suggest that he actively approved the sentence is a fabrication. The ad is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":2429}
{"claim_id":"10111","hypothesis":"Say Aaa! Then Zzz: Tonsillectomy Helps Kids Sleep","explanation_1":"The evidence is really weak on the claim made in the headline, as the story later acknowledges. We wish\u00a0the story\u00a0had spent a little more time on costs and quantifying benefits instead of paying so much attention to one anecdotal case where a surgery was done to alleviate snoring. The health care system needs to continue to be critical of interventions that don\u2019t work or are harmful. It\u2019s clear that we haven\u2019t had good evidence for much of how this old procedure has been done. Parents worry when their children can\u2019t sleep well or have other problems related to enlarged tonsils, but surgery, as this story notes, is not without complications. Instead of giving the subject a light touch, the story dug into some of the details necessary to give parents the information they need to make good decisions. Writers should be careful, though, to distinguish between the real health problems related to tonsil problems and mere snoring, which is harmless in most cases. The headline for this story was a real shame, because the story itself contained good information.","premise":"Oddly, the story mentions physician reimbursements for tonsil surgery but makes no mention of patient costs. \u201cRosenfeld disputes Obama\u2019s claim, saying that insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.\u201d The benefits are never quantified, which is a big problem in this case because so much time is spent on the anecdotal family in the lead. We can\u2019t understand why a headline this bold was put on a story that actually takes pains to point out the lack of evidence supporting tonsil surgeries. The story could have done much more to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but we give it points here for addressing the lack of support for tonsil surgeries, which most parents likely assume are a standard part of growing up. \u201cThen doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn\u2019t until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.\u201d Later it says, \u201cDespite hundreds of studies, there\u2019s still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.\u201d And it says, \u201cThere have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children if they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.\u201d The story does not engage in overt disease-mongering. Good caveats that \u201cnot all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered. About 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year.\u201d The story only quotes one physician, and that source is a surgeon We would have liked to have seen more independent sources tapped \u2013 a pediatrician or family medicine doctor would have been helpful. No meaningful discussion comparing alternative treatments. The story was focused on surgery. There was no discussion of prevention \u2013 of indoor allergens (and avoiding\/treating them with antihistamines) or of obesity. The story does a great job explaining how tonsil surgery as a first resort has evolved over the years. It is clear from the story that surgery is not novel. The story definitely does not rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":2097}
{"claim_id":"9854","hypothesis":"Low-dose lithium reduces side effects from most common treatment for Parkinson's disease","explanation_1":"We appreciate that there is a need to get a reader\u2019s attention with the title of any document, including news releases. This headline grabs readers with the suggestion that lithium \u201creduces side effects of most common treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d a statement that\u2019s simply not supported as no humans with Parkinson\u2019s disease were studied. Treating mice with an induced form of the disease is not the same as treating actual people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Having said that, the release recovers quickly \u2014 in the very first sentence \u2014 to clarify that the research was done in mice, which is commendable. The release also includes some useful caveats regarding the quality of evidence and what additional research needs to be done before lithium can be considered a viable option in humans. A bit more information about the actual research findings and potential harms of lithium would have been helpful. Parkinson\u2019s disease is primarily a disease of the late middle-aged and elderly population. At the moment there are between 500,000 and 1,500,000 people in the US with the disease and approximately 60,000 are diagnosed annually. Although there are now numerous innovative approaches to managing symptoms, dopamine replacement therapy is the dominant treatment. As noted in the news release, the effects of dopamine replacement on the classic symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s are frequently replaced by a set of equally crippling movement disorders. An inexpensive and low-risk solution for the treatment related movement disorders would be a welcomed option for sufferers of the disease and their families","premise":"After a misleading headline, the release establishes quickly that the research is in mice and that clinical trials haven\u2019t been performed. And at this early stage of development, the cost of treatment is not an issue. So we rule this Not Applicable. Having said that, if lithium augmentation of carbidopa\/levodopa did indeed work in humans, the low cost of lithium is a distinct advantage to patients. We aren\u2019t really provided with much in the way of information here \u2014 the number of animals involved or how they measured the actual improvement in abnormal movements or what the results were. One of the researchers talks about \u201csignificant behavioral improvement,\u201d but is that \u201csignificant\u201d only in a statistical sense or something that would be noticeable to an average person? We are also told, \u201clithium boosted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase which increases dopamine synthesis via the inhibition of calpain-1, an enzyme that normally reduces dopamine synthesis\u201d but without really informing the reader with why this is important. We are also told about findings from two earlier studies,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe clearly saw a prevention of the motor difficulties we would expect to see in the animals,\u201d said Andersen. \u201cThe treatment also protected the area of the brain that is normally damaged by Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d It would have been helpful to have some numbers here, or a more thorough description of what the study actually showed. The news release is silent on the issue of the potential for toxicity with lithium augmentation. Although the research was conducted in mice, the researchers did note the potential for toxicity in their publication, \u201c\u2026in a few reported cases lithium treat- ment was suggested to be detrimental to PD patients and to cause side effects\u2026\u201d Since lithium is also used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, it\u2019s possible the release could have pulled from the literature on this use to discuss potential side effects. On its own, the headline of this news release is misleading: \u201cLow-dose lithium reduces side effects from most common treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d Any reader would take this to mean that we\u2019re talking about humans with Parkinson\u2019s disease, when the research was done in mice with an induced form of the disease. That being said, we applaud the release for clarifying in the very first sentence that we\u2019re talking about mice \u2014 something that\u2019s not often done in news releases. We also think\u00a0the excellent comments of Dr. Simon provided some clarity and placed the study into the right context. \u201cThis study suggests potential therapeutic benefit in PD\u2026..One caveat is that other agents that have shown clear efficacy in this model of PD have subsequently failed to show benefit in clinical studies in PD (e.g. CoQ10, creatine, and pioglitazone). However, this study provides additional evidence on top of prior work from Dr. Andersen\u2019s lab and others that lithium may have therapeutic potential in PD, which is a hypothesis that should be tested in clinical trials,\u201d\u00a0So, although the headline alone would be given an unsatisfactory rating, the immediate and extensive clarifications about the quality of evidence saved the day. The release notes that Parkinson\u2019s disease is diagnosed in 60,000 new people each year, a figure which is supported by the NIH. It would have been helpful to state one\u2019s lifetime risk of developing the disease, to help put this number in context. The funding source for the research is clearly identified in the release. However, we are not advised that the Buck Institute and the two senior authors of the paper filed a patent application for low-dose lithium in Parkinsons (US20130017274 A1). Although levodopa\/carbidopa is the main approach to treatment, other drugs are available that are not mentioned. In addition to medical therapy, deep brain stimulation is also available at most academic medical centers. The release makes it clear that lithium is currently available and used for psychiatric illness. Given that the drug is available, it\u2019s conceivable that desperate patients will seek treatment with lithium based on these findings \u2014 which is why it\u2019s all the more important to carefully qualify the results in the headline. It is clear that the use of lithium for this purpose is new. The release also establishes that there was previous research leading up to the study. The headline of the release cannot be justified on the basis of the information provided or by the results of the study itself.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":6736}

In general, places that disregarded social distancing rules saw more influenza cases. What's false: The second wave of the influenza outbreak started before the end of WWI and was largely fueled by sickened soldiers traveling home to hospitals.","premise":"In mid-April 2020, as some U.S. cities saw crowds of people protesting against shelter-in place or stay-home orders implemented to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, a meme started circulating that claimed the majority of deaths during the 1918-19 pandemic occurred after people started to ignore social distancing guidelines:  There is a lot of truth in the above-displayed meme, for instance: However, the timeline presented in this meme is inaccurate and, contrary to what the text implies, the second wave of this pandemic was not fueled mainly by a lack of social distancing. The 1918 pandemic, commonly known by the misnomer \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d left at least 50 million people dead around the world, including 675,000 in the United States. Comparatively speaking, about 20 million soldiers and civilians died in WWI. There were three waves of illness during this pandemic, which started in the spring of 1918 and subsided in the summer of 1919, the most deadly of which was the second wave that peaked in the fall of 1918. We haven\u2019t been able to definitively determine the percentage of deaths that occurred during the deadly second wave. We can say, however, that the U.S. saw close to 200,000 deaths from the pandemic in October 1918 alone. The U.S. lost approximately 115,000 soldiers during all of WWI. While the majority of deaths did occur during the second wave, these deaths can\u2019t be solely attributed to a lack of social distancing after the war. In fact, a\u00a0timeline of the 1918 pandemic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that the second wave started in September 1918, approximately two months before Germany officially surrendered on Nov. 11, ending WWI. History.com notes that the second wave of the 1918 pandemic was largely fueled by sickened soldiers who traveled to countries across Europe, the U.S., and Africa: While the global pandemic lasted for two years, the vast majority of deaths were packed into three especially cruel months in the fall of 1918. Historians now believe that the fatal severity of the Spanish flu\u2019s \u201csecond wave\u201d was caused by a mutated virus spread by wartime troop movements \u2026 In late August 1918, military ships departed the English port city of Plymouth carrying troops unknowingly infected with this new, far deadlier strain of Spanish flu. As these ships arrived in cities like Brest in France, Boston in the United States and Freetown in west Africa, the second wave of the global pandemic began. \u201cThe rapid movement of soldiers around the globe was a major spreader of the disease,\u201d says James Harris, a historian at Ohio State University who studies both infectious disease and World War I. \u201cThe entire military industrial complex of moving lots of men and material in crowded conditions was certainly a huge contributing factor in the ways the pandemic spread.\u201d While military parades and a lack of social distancing at the end of the war did not cause the second wave of the 1918 pandemic, they did exacerbate the problem. Much like today, many cities in the U.S. closed schools, businesses, and other public spaces during the 1918 pandemic. (You can read some old news clippings urging social distancing here.)

{"claim_id":"10673","hypothesis":"Beyond wrinkles: Botox is a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer\u2019s cramp","explanation_1":"This is a thoroughly reported story on a medical therapy that merits skepticism but which has also earned a reasonable amount of scientific respect in recent years. It does a nice job of explaining the myriad uses of Botox in medicine today and issues some needed cautions about potential harms, nonapproved uses, and misuse. The story\u2019s sources are plentiful and appear to be balanced. But is this enough? How good is the evidence to support the various uses of Botox? Are there reasonable alternatives to Botox for some of the conditions it treats? Is it okay to tease a national audience with a headline that shouts one thing, but place deeper in the story the caveats that suggest another? There is extraordinary variability in the quality of the research on Botox from one medical condition to another\u2014missing information important for a national audience that inevitably includes people searching desperately for solutions to intractable problems. For example, our quick literature search turned up more than a score of randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews on the use of Botox for the involuntary muscle contortions that cause the painful neck disorder known as cervical dystonia\u2013and just one, very small, inadequate trial on Botox treatments for low back pain. The story fails to quantify side effects, most of which seem to be dismissed as transient. And readers might be better served if the story put more meat on the bones of alternative approaches (including no treatment) to some of the conditions Botox treats. Indeed, one could argue that the story\u2019s ultimate effect is that of treatment mongering\u2014simply because it shines so much (mostly flattering) light on Botox. The admonition from one source\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t demand a certain treatment just because you saw a headline\u201d\u2014can\u2019t compete with the magazine cover\u2019s actual headline: \u201cThe Botox Boom\u201d followed inside by, \u201cYou thought Botox was all about looks?

It explains that insurance companies will reimburse treatments for FDA-approved uses and in some cases nonapproved uses. It mentions cost of wrinkle treatments in a sidebar, but it doesn\u2019t compare the costs of Botox with the costs of the alternatives\u2013for wrinkles, neck pain, or other problems\u2014nor does it attempt to account for the expense of office visits and other associated costs. The story provides no quantitative estimates of the benefits of using Botox. The story mentions several of the major side effects of Botox, points out that the long-term effects of multiple injections over many years are unknown, and cautions readers about the potential dangers of using Botox for off-label uses. A sidebar in the story warns readers about the dangers of highly concentrated injections derived from bootlegged Botox. But the article\u00a0could have added more about the frequency of side effects that are listed in the package insert. About a fifth of patients treated for spasmodic eye-blinking develop drooping lid; about a fifth of those treated for cervical muscle spasms have difficulty swallowing; and recipients of wrinkle treatments frequently suffer bruising or swelling. Though the news article hints that there are good studies and bad (\u201cWhere the science is sound\u2026\u201d), urges caution for unapproved uses, and notes that rigorous trials are underway for several conditions, it provides no true description of the quality of evidence to support the use of Botox for the painful neck condition known as cervical dystonia or any other condition.

High-quality research to support many of its unapproved uses has yet to be published. The news article suggests that some of the conditions Botox treats are legitimate medical problems. But it also seems to medicalize other conditions such as facial wrinkles and sweating that are simply the normal consequence of life, and details how off-label uses are considered \"\"quality-of-life saving.\"\" One could argue that the story\u2019s ultimate effect is that of treatment mongering\u2013because it shines so much (mostly flattering) light on Botox.

This story mentions treatments other than Botox (deep brain stimulation for cervical dystonia, drugs for headaches, and drugs or surgery for urological problems). But these are light sketches against a bold tapestry of information on Botox. There is no discussion of surgical or topical alternatives for wrinkles, medical alternatives for dystonias, or non-treatment for several conditions, including sweating. Readers would benefit from more subtle comparisons to see how Botox measures up against other therapies. The US News story explains that botulinum toxin (brand name Botox) is FDA-approved for some medical conditions and not approved for many others, and rightly suggests that Botox is widely available.

She\u2019s correct that the Affordable Care Act eliminates the treatment of domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and eliminates gender rating. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Moore a Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.\"","premise":"\"On Sept. 29, 2013, two days before a political showdown over Obamacare led to a government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore defended the health care law. On MSNBC\u2019s \"\"Disrupt with Karen Finney\"\" show, the Milwaukee Democrat described how bad women have had it -- and how things will improve with the Affordable Care Act. She stated: \"\"If you\u2019re a victim of domestic violence, even that\u2019s seen as a pre-existing condition. Women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender rating. All of that is over.\"\" So, we need to determine whether being a domestic violence victim is regarded as a pre-existing health condition; and whether women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of \"\"gender rating.\"\" We also need to see how the health care law handles domestic violence and gender rating. Pre-existing conditions In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama made a statement similar to the first part of Moore\u2019s claim. She said it was legal in some states to regard domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and use it as a basis for denying health insurance coverage. PolitiFact National rated Obama\u2019s statement True because at the time, eight states permitted treating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center. The law center told us that its most recent check, in 2010, showed the District of Columbia as well as six states -- Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming -- had no law prohibiting the insurers from designating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. However, there were restrictions in some of those states. (The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, also referred us to the law center on this question.) In rating Michelle Obama\u2019s statement, our colleagues pointed out that just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole. Indeed, an insurer might deny a woman coverage based on an injury or condition without it being disclosed that the injury or condition was a result of domestic violence. There was evidence in the 1990s that using domestic violence to deny coverage was widespread, but the law center told us it is not aware of any data on how many insurance companies actually use domestic violence now as a pre-existing condition. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act will prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems, such as high blood pressure, depression or diabetes, as well as \"\"conditions arising out of domestic violence.\"\" So, while there isn\u2019t evidence that health insurers commonly use domestic violence as a pre-existing condition to deny coverage, it is \"\"seen\"\" as such in that it is legal in a handful of states for health insurers to do so. Moore is also correct that practice is being outlawed under Obamacare. \"\"Gender rating\"\" The second part of Moore\u2019s claim is that women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of \"\"gender rating.\"\" There\u2019s no dispute that health insurers use gender as one factor in setting rates; others include age, family size, geographic region and health status. But Moore\u2019s broad claim that women pay 50 percent higher rates isn\u2019t so clear. Moore cited a March 2012 report, again from the National Women\u2019s Law Center. The center said it used the eHealthInsurance website to calculate premiums in the individual market -- in other words, premiums for women who purchase health insurance themselves, rather than getting it through their employer or spouse. The individual market is a key target of the Affordable Care Act. The center said premiums were at least 50 percent higher for women than for men in a number of instances, including health plans for 25-year-olds in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming; and for 40-year-olds in Alabama, Arizona, Kansas and Kentucky. Although federal anti-discrimination protections enacted prior to the Affordable Care Act generally prohibit employers from charging female employees higher premiums than male employees, businesses with predominantly female workforces are routinely charged more for group coverage, according to the law center. The reform law prohibits gender rating, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. So, there is evidence that some women buying health insurance in the individual market, a key target of Obamacare, are charged 50 percent more than men for the same coverage. Such gender rating is made illegal under the health reform law. Our rating Moore said domestic violence \"\"is seen as a pre-existing\"\" health condition and \"\"women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender ratings,\"\" but under Obamacare, \"\"all of that is over.\"\" The thrust of what Moore said is partially accurate, in that there is some evidence to back the pre-existing condition and 50 percent parts of her claim.

{"claim_id":"11002","hypothesis":"Popular Bone Drugs Linked to Reduced Colon Cancer Risk","explanation_1":"One can tell a lot about how a story is going to be from its lead quote. This HealthDay story on a new study indicating potential cancer prevention benefits from bone density drugs \u2014\u00a0quoted Dr. Gad Rennert, the study\u2019s lead author, sounding \u201cThese [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers. \u2026\u00a0This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins.\u201d From there on, Rennert is allowed to pump up the benefits of these drugs and to sweep aside any concern about their risks or broad application to a large population. Contrast that with the Reuters Health story which chose to quote\u00a0Eric Jacobs from the American Cancer Society saying, \u201cThe lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing\u2026.However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies.\u201d From that point on, the story took a cautious, objective look at the study\u2019s findings. We wish both stories had done a better job parsing the evidence, but we think that, overall, Reuters Health provided better context for readers. Roughly 1 out of every 20 people in the US will develop colorectal cancer at current rates. If taking a simple pill for $10 a month can keep cancer at bay, the world would be a much better place. Because solutions to significant health challenges are usually not that simple, this story and others that covered the same study should have been more cautious in explaining the results and showing readers why they might not translate to an immediate benefit for them.","premise":"Unlike the Reuters Health story, this story did not discuss costs. This is a shame because if the monthly cost is $10, as Reuters Health notes, that may be cheap on an individual level. As a public health policy, though, $120 a year across a huge population could add significantly to an already overspent health care system. The lead says, \u201cPeople who take drugs called bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss may also reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by almost 60 percent compared to those not on the drugs, a new study suggests.\u201d What this story and the Reuters Health story failed to do was give the raw numbers that are provided in the study itself. The story should have said that 138 women in the non-cancer group took biophosphonates and 97 in the cancer group took them, meaning that 41 women appear to have benefited from taking the drugs. If the study had found that 97 women had taken these drugs in both groups, the study would not have made headlines. Also, it might have been helpful to show that there were actually larger differences in some of the other factors that were studied. For example, 120 women in the group of cancer patients had a history of colorectal cancer in the family compared to 75 women in the control group. This story did a better job of mentioning \u201cThe magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study\u2026\u201d But then it goes on to say that the magnitude of the benefit is similar to cholesterol lowering medicines. The main difference is that this story, despite the caveats mentioned, is more enthusiastic about the findings than the Reuters story. We give this story and the Reuters Health story credit for at least mentioning some of the risks of taking bisphosphonates. \u201cThe researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue). Bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\u201d But neither story quantified the harms in any way. This story also failed to point out, as the Reuters Health story did, that \u201cearlier study from the UK had found no link between bisphosphonate and colon cancer. Indeed, it found a higher risk of throat cancer in patients on the medication.\u201d  The story makes a good attempt at explaining the quality of the evidence. It says, \u201cFor the study, Rennert\u2019s team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel\u2026.The researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.\u201d The story added a nice detail missed by Reuters Health, saying, \u201cThe findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect \u2014 that is, the study doesn\u2019t prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.\u201d\u00a0But both stories fail to point out that this study did not look at 933 women who took the drugs and 933 who did not. Of those 1,866 women, only 97 of the cancer patients took the drugs, and only 138 of the women without cancer had taken them. So, yes, the researchers were able to find what appears to be a statistically significant risk reduction, but they also found differences in physical activity, body mass index, vegetable intake and the use of statins and aspirin. The study highlights the biophosphonate connection, but the story should have explained why a difference of 41 women without cancer taking these drugs out of a total of nearly 2,000 would be enough evidence to support some of the cheerleading in the story. Though this story, in some ways, provided more information on the quality of the evidence, it too missed the point that the biggest limitation of the study is that factors related to the women\u2019s underlying risk of cancer were lower in those taking bisphosphonates, and that the authors did not collect adequate information to control for those differences. This is why one needs a randomized trial. And the mention that such a study should be \u201crelatively easy\u201d to do is not likely to be true. One will need a very large population to detect any difference on top of routine screening with a colonoscopy. One cannot do a study and not offer the control patients current standard of care. That means everyone needs to be screened first. This will be a very hard, expensive study to do. Neither story engaged in disease-mongering. Both stories quoted the exact same sources: the lead author and\u00a0Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. But both stories used their comments in very different ways. The Reuters Health story did not allow Rennert to run wild with enthusiasm. The HealthDay story did. For example, when the story notes that \u201cA randomized trial is needed to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said.\u201d It follows that sobering bit of news up immediately with, \u201cIt should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,\u201d he said. Should be relatively easy? Ask any drug company how much time it takes and what it costs to bring a drug to market and no one will tell you that clinical trials are easy. This is especially troubling given that a previous study just last year showed no benefit, and, remember, we are talking about just 41 women who appear to have staved off cancer by taking these drugs. Both stories relied on Jacobs from the American Cancer Society for the same bit of context. \u201cFortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal\u00a0cancer, he said. \u201cIn particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.\u201d Both stories make it clear that these are drugs currently on the market. This story provided even more detail, saying, \u201cBisphosphonates include such common drugs as Fosamax (alendronate), Boniva (ibandronate), Actonel (risedronate) and Reclast (zoledronic acid). These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.\u201d This story made it clear that the findings are part of a series of findings, some of them contradictory, about the side benefits of different drugs for cancer prevention. It says, for example, \u201cHowever, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert.\u201d  Neither story relied on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":7176}
{"claim_id":"9841","hypothesis":"Experimental Treatment May Help Relieve Back Pain","explanation_1":"The story presents the results of a trial examining outcomes of patients with a disc herniation treated with a spinal injection of ozone and steroids. Because the story describes results presented at a meeting, it lacks details that are important to assess the quality of the study. Patients in this study had symptoms that weren\u2019t improving with conservative treatment and were thought to be candidates for a steroid injection or surgery. Instead, they received a single injection of a combination of ozone gas and steroids. Six month outcomes are described \u2013 about a third had complete pain relief, another third had partial pain relief, 20% had little pain relief and 7% had no pain relief or were worse. Though promising, these results may be no better and possibly worse than steroid injections alone and probably worse than for surgery. Disc herniations can cause pain that radiates from the low back or buttocks into the legs, often below the knee \u2013 commonly called sciatica. Though the story refers to disc herniations as causing low back pain, leg symptoms are often more bothersome to patients than the back pain itself. Treatments for disc herniations such as surgery are also generally better at relieving leg than back pain. For most patients with sciatica due to a disc herniation, the natural history is one of improvement over time. The body has the ability to shrink the disc material that is irritating the nerves that are causing the pain. However, some patients continue to have symptoms and these are the ones addressed in this study. Though not clear from the story, there are good treatments available for these patients. The standard of care for patients with persistent and bothersome symptoms for more than 6 weeks is surgical discectomy. It is common that patients may undergo an injection of steroids into the area where the disc is inflaming the nerve as an alternative to surgery. However, it is not clear that this results in outcomes that are the same or better than going directly to surgery. Indeed there is little data to suggest that steroid injections decrease the need for subsequent surgery. With this background, the current study seeks to examine whether adding ozone to a steroid injection improves pain in patients with a disc herniation who aren\u2019t getting better. The major problem is that the reader does not know whether the outcomes seen are as good as those with a steroid injection or surgery. The study didn\u2019t compare these treatments, nor did the story describe the results of studies from patients with a steroid injection without ozone or surgery. If the story did, it would have to state that the outcomes may be similar but don\u2019t appear to be better. With that context, the value of this treatment would appear less certain that implied.","premise":"Though this is still an experimental approach, it would have been appropriate to discuss the costs in terms of the closest similar treatment \u2013 an epidural steroid injection. Since the story claims the experimental approach has been used thousands of times in Europe, some cost frame of reference was possible. The story did a good job explaining the benefits observed in this study. However, where it fell short was in comparing these outcomes to those that may be expected with alternative treatments \u2013 specifically, an epidural steroid injection alone or disc surgery. The story explained that no side effects were observed and that a small percent of patients had more pain after the injection. Bu the story does not talk about the potential risks of ozone gas to individuals as well as the environment. Ozone is a toxic gas and one would expect that the benefit of its use as a medical treatment would need to be clearly demonstrated prior to recommending it as a routine treatment option. Even if that is done, one would want to know that this gas can be safely generated and administered without causing toxicity to those administering it and to the environment itself. In this context, the mention of no risks seen in the study needs to be taken with considerable caution. The story did an adequate job explaining the preliminary nature of the results and that further research is needed before this can be considered for routine use. (But we think it could have done a better job of directly addressing supporters\u2019 claims that the new approach \u201ccould become a standard treatment.\u201d This came in the third paragraph. More conservative statements came much later.) It also described that the outcomes could be due to the ozone, the steroid,\u00a0a combination of both or just the favorable natural history of a disc herniation. What the story didn\u2019t do as well is describe outcomes of current treatments that would be alternatives. Though the story made the important point that the natural history of many disc herniations is to improve on their own with time, the story made an incorrect statement. By saying that, \u201cAs\u00a0many as 80% of adults in the U.S. suffer from lower back pain at some point in their lives, and for many, the cause is a herniated disc,\u201d it implies incorrectly that disc herniations are a common cause of low back pain. It isn\u2019t. In fact, only a\u00a0small percent of patients with low back pain have a disc herniation as the cause. It is true that patients with pain radiating into the leg are more likely to have a disc herniation, but this was not stated and most patients with low back pain do not have associated leg pain. The story quotes a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and it is implied but not stated that this person was not associated with the study. The spokesman provided important context. Though the study described alternative treatments, it didn\u2019t actually state how the results reported here compare. A key deficiency of this study is that it didn\u2019t compare the treatment to common alternatives. Since there are good treatments available for herniated discs that aren\u2019t getting better on their own with conservative treatment, one can only comment on the current results in comparison to these alternatives. This was not done. The story made clear that this treatment is available in Europe, but not in the United States. The story made clear that this is a relatively new experimental approach for a disc herniation. The story used several sources and did not appear to rely upon a press release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":5463}
{"claim_id":"10038","hypothesis":"The Beep of the Sensor, the Thrill of Control","explanation_1":"The article describes one man\u2019s experience using a new combination glucose sensor and insulin pump for diabetes. The article explained some of the expenses (although it never gave the cost of the device itself), described the device and how this compared to the rest of the options, and described harms or disadvantages, at least those experienced by this one person. The story could be improved by describing published harms or side effects. What was actually found in the clinical trials? Because the story describes one man\u2019s experience, much of the information is anecdotal and could be biasing. The story is lacking any description of the evidence to support using this new device or this level of monitoring (how do we know this works?) and what it can actually do (will it improve A1C\u2013average blood sugar over the past 2 to 3 months\u2013or will it improve the number of severe low blood sugar episodes experienced or something else?). No independent source was obtained to discuss the new device, another problem with this purely anecdotal approach.","premise":"The story does describe monthly testing supply costs for the new device ($350). However, the article could be improved by telling readers how much the actual device costs and\/or comparing this to typical blood glucose testing monitors and supplies. There is no discussion about clinical outcomes, such as by how much it might improve A1C levels, or on average, how many severe low blood sugar episodes were avoided by using this device compared to traditional devices. Through one man\u2019s story-telling, harms are described and included malfunctions with the machine leading to recalibration or inserting new catheters, trouble relying on machine recommendations for insulin dosages, potential for infection at the injection site, and inconvenience of being awakened or disturbed by the beeping or buzzing alarm. Of course, it\u2019s not clear whether these are the only harms, but they seem reasonable. The story could be improved by reporting on actual harms reported in clinical trials. The article does not describe the evidence (trial, observational, or otherwise) supporting effectiveness of the new device. It does tell readers that this new device may be inaccurate in its blood sugar readings by as much as 18%, but there is no discussion about outcomes, such as by how much it might improve A1C levels, or on average, how many severe low blood sugar episodes were avoided by using this device compared to traditional devices. The level of monitoring and use of injections as described in this article are beyond what has been tested in randomized controlled trials. No independent sources of information were obtained. In fact, the only information is related anecdotally by only one man, which could be biasing. The story describes alternative options, including traditional blood glucose monitoring devices and insulin pumps (minus the glucose sensors). The story also describes other similar devices that may be on the market soon. The story states the \u201cParadigm Real-Time\u201d combination insulin pump and glucose sensor was approved by the FDA, implying it is available to consumers. It was a little confusing to hear one man\u2019s story about traveling to another city for a \u201ctest-period\u201d in which the manufacturer paid for supplies, which sounded a bit like a study scenario or a special promotional deal. And, it\u2019s still not clear whether this is available everywhere or only at certain locations. But, the article also tells readers that insurance won\u2019t pay for the supplies as yet (even though the anecdotal story-teller felt it was worth it to him to start paying this), adding to the idea that if one wanted to pay the out-of-pocket expense, one could obtain this device. The story tells readers that the device was approved in June, which lets people know this is new to the market. We can\u2019t be sure if the story relied largely on a news release.
