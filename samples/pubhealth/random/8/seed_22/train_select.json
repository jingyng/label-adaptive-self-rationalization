{"claim_id":"22143","hypothesis":"I\u2019ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning.","explanation_1":"Sen. Herb Kohl says he\u2019s never done any negative campaigning","premise":"\"Twenty-three years into his Senate tenure, Wisconsin\u2019s Herb Kohl hasn\u2019t announced whether he will seek another six-year term in 2012. But as Republicans step up their criticism of him, Kohl is making crystal clear his disdain for the kind of rough-and-tumble campaign environment that almost surely would be part of another campaign. Compared to his last couple races when Kohl used his massive personal fortune to vanquish underfunded opponents with soft-sell TV ads, it would be a new environment for the senator who owns the Milwaukee Bucks and built the Kohl\u2019s department and grocery store chains. In remarks to reporters in Madison on April 28, 2011, Kohl ruminated about the state of today\u2019s campaigns. He said \"\"people don\u2019t like anybody in public life\"\" because of \"\"venomous\"\" attacks and sniping among congressional members, something he said he engages in \"\"hardly at all.\"\" Then he got specific: \"\"I\u2019ve been through four campaigns and have not done any negative campaigning. And I don\u2019t get into any personal jousts with other people in public life. But that\u2019s just my style.\"\" So has Kohl really avoided any negative campaigning? That\u2019s quite a claim in this age of mud-slinging and aggressive campaign tactics. We decided to check it out. Of course, it would be impossible to track down every campaign statement Kohl made since 1988 and copies of decades-old TV ads. So we focused our look-back to media descriptions of TV ads, debates and the candidates\u2019 strategies in his four races. We also talked to the people who should know best: several of his former opponents or their aides, Kohl\u2019s campaign staff, and a longtime political reporter. Kohl has of course benefited from negative attacks launched by groups supporting his campaigns, but he spoke only of his own campaigns\u2019 conduct, so we\u2019ll limit our review to that. One more note before we begin: Because there is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes \"\"negative\"\" campaigning, we asked Team Kohl what exactly he meant by his claim. \"\"Sen. Kohl has said that he believes campaigning is about telling the people of Wisconsin what he\u2019s done and what he plans to do, not tearing down his opponent or telling people not to vote for them,\"\" Kohl press secretary Lynn Becker said. \"\"He has not been deliberately malicious or factually dishonest in his campaigns or while serving in public office.\"\" Indeed, his two most recent opponents said there was no negative campaigning in their contests -- and had high praise for Kohl. \"\"He never did anything negative in his campaign. He\u2019ll have the job as long as he wants the job,\"\" said John Gillespie, founder of Rawhide Boys Ranch, who lost to Kohl in 2000. \"\"Say hi to Herb if you talk to him. Tell him I owe him a dinner,\"\" said Robert Lorge, Kohl\u2019s 2006 rival. Fair enough. Those were landslide wins. What about the earlier contests? 1988: Kohl was a surprise entrant in the Democratic primary, winning the nomination comfortably over former Gov. Tony Earl, Ed Garvey and Doug La Follette. He frustrated his rivalsby limiting his debate participation and spending millions on TV ads. At the time, Earl\u2019s media consultant David Axelrod charged that Kohl\u2019s popular slogan -- \"\"Nobody\u2019s Senator But Yours\"\" -- was an implicit negative attack. It implied that candidates who -- unlike Kohl -- have to raise most of their campaign money are beholden to donors, said Axelrod, who later went on to help a guy named Barack Obama get elected president. Earl attacked Kohl as uninformed and error-prone, prompting Kohl campaign aide Bill Christofferson to call Earl \"\"desperate\"\" and guilty of misrepresentation. Insiders on both sides agree that Kohl ran no attack ads in the primary -- and none in the very tight general election that saw Republican state legislator Susan Engeleiter close the gap to just a few pointswith a series of ads targeting Kohl in the closing weeks. Engeleiter herself told us she has \"\"nothing but positive recollections\"\" of a \"\"pretty cordial campaign.\"\" She also praised Kohl\u2019s dealing with her when she later was confirmed as administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration. La Follette and Garvey say today that they wouldn\u2019t call Kohl\u2019s primary race negative. Regarding Kohl\u2019s slogan, La Follette agreed with Kohl aide Christofferson, who said: \u00a0\"\"Herb Kohl was talking about himself, not anyone else, when he promised to be 'nobody's senator but yours.'\"\" Indeed, Kohl explicitly used his positive campaign ads as a selling point, and called his victory a blow against negative campaigning. 1994: In his first re-election campaign, Kohl wasted little time aggressively portraying Republican opponent Robert Welch, a state lawmaker from Redgranite, as an \"\"extreme conservative\"\" and flip-flopper. At an early debate, he cited Welch\u2019s no-exceptions stance against abortion and his vow never to vote for a tax hike as \"\"extreme.\"\" According to media accounts, he did not explain the flip-flop charge. Afterwards, Welch told reporters Kohl was \"\"nastier than I expected.\"\" Later, after Welch attempted to tie Kohl to President Clinton, Kohl launched a rare TV ad that focused on an opponent by name. Another followed. The ads accused Welch of distorting Kohl\u2019s record. One said that \"\"fellow Republicans\"\" had criticized Welch\u2019s tactics -- something deemed misleading in a Milwaukee Journal fact check. The exchange led Welch to accuse Kohl of running a \"\"multimillion dollar mudslinging campaign.\"\" Kohl said it was Welch who went negative. The rhetoric heated up. At one point in the race, after Welch accused Kohl of \"\"religion bashing,\"\" Kohl spokesman Jeffrey Gillis said that \"\" Welch's attack again shows that he'll say or do anything to get elected.\"\" So, that seems like quite a bit of snarling. Looking back, though, Welch\u2019s campaign manager Mike Maxwell doesn\u2019t have strong opinions about the back and forth. \"\"I don\u2019t know that Kohl was particularly negative through that election,\"\" he told us. He didn\u2019t recall the \"\"distort\"\" ad that Kohl ran. He did say that some might consider the \"\"extreme\"\" charge a negative attack. Kohl, Maxwell recalled, \"\"just had overwhelming resources and then he signed (Bucks first round draft choice Glenn Robinson) six days before the election.\"\" (We could not reach Welch for comment). Kenneth Lamke, a Milwaukee Sentinel reporter who covered the 1994 race, offered the strongest opinion we heard on whether Kohl went negative against Welch. He says yes. Lamke said the \"\"extreme\"\" charge by Kohl was \"\"within bounds but uncharacteristic of Herb.\"\" Lamke viewed the attack as unprovoked and an exaggeration; Gillis, the Kohl aide, said it was a response to the drumbeat of criticism of Kohl during the Republican primary. Lamke, we should note, asked us to describe his personal politics as \"\"leans Republican.\"\" We asked several political scientists to characterize the language of the Kohl ad. They reacted cautiously because we could not provide the ad itself, just direct quotes from it in media accounts. That makes it impossible to fully judge the tone. Vanderbilt professor John Geer, an author of a much-cited book on negative campaigning, said it sounded like a \"\"tame\"\" response ad -- \"\"not the kind of classic negative ad the public doesn\u2019t like.\"\" Darrell West, of the Brookings Institution, agreed. UW-Madison\u2019s Ken Goldstein said Kohl\u2019s ad met the academic research definition of \"\"negative\"\" because it focused on Welch, not Kohl. The test of whether it was unfair is whether it was accurate, he said. So Kohl\u2019s campaigns have been remarkably low-confrontation affairs, with the most notable exception being 1994, the first -- and perhaps only -- time Kohl aired TV spots going after an opponent. So how does Kohl fare on his statement that he has never campaigned negatively? Clearly, Kohl has spent the vast bulk of his time and money on upbeat, positive ads. Even his opponents agree strongly with that -- one even wants to buy him dinner. The only ad that pops up as arguably negative is the 1994 \"\"distort\"\" spot against Welch. It drew some critical attention, but is viewed as a pretty tame response ad. Beyond that, Kohl\u2019s campaigns have engaged in some labeling and name calling. And Kohl\u2019s aggressive 1994 portrayal of Welch as an \"\"extremist\"\" was arguably negative. Kohl is mostly on target here, with some minor exceptions. .\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":2410}

Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.\"","premise":"\"Sunday show talking heads continued to debate vaccinations of children -- specifically, how there should be no debate -- as they analyzed political missteps from the past week. BBC World News America anchor Katherine \"\"Katty\"\" Kay made a startling comparison to highlight how Americans have been less diligent in making sure their children are properly immunized. \"\"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States,\"\" Kay said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \"\"Because when people really need it,\u00a0and they see the effects that measles can have on their communities, they will make sure that their children vaccinate.\"\" Rhetoric about the measles outbreak stemming from Disneyland in California, home to a significant measles-resistant population, is keeping PunditFact\u00a0and PolitiFact\u00a0busy. We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kay\u2019s claim. While we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kay\u2019s source. The World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, maintains immunization rates for the measles vaccine among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013. There were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percent\u00a0for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine\u00a0in 2013, according to the WHO data. (The\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts\u00a0the measles immunization rate in the United States is\u00a091.9 percent. But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.) The countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe. United States 91 percent * Algeria 95 percent Botswana 94 percent Burundi 98 percent Egypt 96 percent Eritrea 96 percent Gambia 96 percent Kenya 93 percent Lesotho 92 percent Libya 98 percent Mauritius 99 percent Morocco 99 percent Rwanda 97 percent Seychelles 97 percent Tanzania 99 percent Tunisia 94 percent Zimbabwe 93 percent  Of course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent). More broadly, it\u2019s not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States\u2019 include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. South Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a Feb. 5 press release highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a \"\"major public health success\"\" that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day. Still, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. Reducing by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations millenium goals. Unlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added. \"\"I\u2019m old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available,\"\" Troisi said, \"\"and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason we\u2019re seeing this refusal is because parents haven\u2019t seen what these diseases can do.\"\" Because we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about 319 million, making it the third-most populated country. China, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent. Our ruling Kay said, \"\"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States.\"\" We found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.\"","label":0,"__index_level_0__":6360}
{"claim_id":"27272","hypothesis":"\"A photograph showing an odd-looking, large bat with an elongated face known as a \"\"hammerhead bat.\"","explanation_1":"Images of the hammer-headed bat are often met with skepticism, and some viewers claim that this odd-looking creature could be the real-world animal responsible for various sightings of mythical creatures such as the \u201cNew Jersey Devil.\u201d","premise":"Digital editing has been responsible for the creation of images of some fantastically fictional looking creatures, such as seven-headed snakes, pink-horned rhinos, and impossibly small kittens. In July 2018, many social media users wondered if they were witnessing a similar creation in an image of an odd-looking, large animal said to be a \u201chammerhead bat\u201d:  We have not been able to pinpoint the exact origins of this photograph, but we can say that the hammerhead bat (also known as the \u201chammer-headed bat\u201d) is a genuine animal that looks like the one pictured here. The hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) is a megabat found in the tropical forests of central Africa. A profile on the large fruit bat from Bat Magazine provides some more information about this unusual-looking animal: The hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), widely distributed in equatorial Africa, is one of three species of African fruit bat thought to be asymptomatically infected with the Ebola virus; though scientists do not know if the species is an incidental host or a reservoir of Ebolavirus. The little-collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata) and the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are the other two species. The species is locally common and is typically found in lowland tropical moist forests, riverine forests, swamp forests, mangroves and palm forests, where it roosts in trees. Although colonies up to 25 bats have been observed, the average hammer-headed fruit bat roost is fewer than five bats. The hammer-headed bat, with wingspans up to 38 inches (97 cm), is Africa\u2019s largest bat. Strong sexual dimorphism is observed in the species, as males are significantly larger than females. Males have a large head with enlarged rostrum, larynx and lips that allows for the production of loud honking calls; the appearance of females is similar to most other fruit bats. The species has a \u201clek\u201d mating system whereby a few hundred males gather into groups (leks) to attract female mates. Although the hammerhead bat is a relatively large bat, the viral image may have given some viewers a false impression of the animal\u2019s true size. The person holding this fruit bat is extending the animal out toward the camera, and since the bat is closer to the lens than the human, the forced perspective makes the animal appear larger than normal. Photographs exhibiting the forced perspective optical illusion have caused confusion about the relative sizes of frogs, rats, snakes, and half-eaten sharks. As noted by Bats Magazine, the hammer-headed bat can possess a wingspan of nearly 40 inches, but it\u2019s average body length is only about 10 inches: H. monstrosus is the largest bat found in Africa, with males being significantly larger than females. Males range in mass from 228 g to 450 g, averaging 377 g. Females are about half the size, weighing from 218 to 377 g, and averaging 275 g. Males range in length from 220 to 280 mm, with an average of 250 mm. Females measure 195 to 225 mm, averaging 210 mm. Males have a wingspan of 686 to 970 mm, and females have an average wingspan of 840 mm. We\u2019ve collected a few other images of the hammerhead bat for comparison:","label":0,"__index_level_0__":5305}
{"claim_id":"473","hypothesis":"Ring of fire: Australian state declares emergency as wildfires approach Sydney.","explanation_1":"Australia\u2019s most populous state declared its second emergency in as many months on Thursday as extreme heat and strong winds stoked more than 100 bushfires, including three major blazes on Sydney\u2019s doorstep.","premise":"A day after Australia recorded its hottest day on record, thick smoke blanketed the harbor city, shrouded the Opera House and brought many outdoor activities to a halt. The state of emergency declaration gave firefighters broad powers to control government resources, force evacuations, close roads and shut down utilities across New South Wales, which is home to more than 7 million people. Authorities said nearly 120 fires remained ablaze by late afternoon, more than half of which are uncontrolled, and with temperatures forecast to top 45 degrees Celsius (113\u00b0F) in some areas, officials warned residents to be on high alert. \u201cThe firefront has been spreading very quickly and intensely,\u201d NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney, adding that two firefighters had been airlifted to hospital with burns to their faces and airways. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very difficult and dangerous set of circumstances.\u201d  Days out from Christmas, a time when many Australians head to the coast for the holidays, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian advised people to make sure \u201cyou are prepared to change your plans should circumstances change.\u201d  In Shoalhaven, a popular coastal destination some 190 km (120 miles) south of Sydney, local mayor Amanda Findley said people were poised to evacuate. \u201cThere is a large amount of smoke looming over the city, which shows how close the fire is,\u201d Findley told Reuters by telephone. \u201cIt is extremely hot and windy now so we are all worried the fire could spread. People are really worried that they may lose everything.\u201d  The RFS posted footage on its official Twitter account showing firefighters tackling one of the three blazes ringing Sydney. A waterbomber aircraft was dwarfed by thick grey and black billowing cloud as it attempted to douse flames in bushland just meters away from homes. Australia has been battling wildfires across much of its east coast for weeks, leaving six people dead, more than 680 homes destroyed and nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of bushland burnt. Berejiklian said as many as 40 homes had been destroyed on Thursday. Australia on Wednesday broke all-time heat records for the second day running, with maximum temperatures reaching an average of 41.9 degree Celsius, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Some 1,700 firefighters have been deployed across NSW, but officials warned that was still not enough to cover every potential danger and urged people in high risk areas to evacuate while it was still safe to do so. The current state of emergency will last for seven days, while a total fire ban that has been in place since Tuesday will remain until midnight on Saturday. The major fires around Sydney, which is home to more than 5 million people, have resulted in days of heavy pollution in the city usually known for its sparkling harbor and blue skies. One megafire in the Kanangra Boyd National Park to the city\u2019s southwest had crept to the very outskirts of Campbelltown, a suburb of 157,000 people. By late afternoon, Sydney was sitting at No.4 on the IQAir AirVisual live rankings of pollution in global cities, above Dhaka, Mumbai, Shanghai and Jakarta. Many commuters have donned breathing masks in recent weeks as air quality has plunged to hazardous levels not previously seen in the city. NSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan said the service had experienced a 10% surge in call-outs for patients suffering respiratory conditions over the past week and urged susceptible people to remain indoors and keep their medication close. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has weathered a storm of criticism on social media in recent days for going on an overseas holiday during the emergency, adding to criticism that his government is failing to deliver adequate climate change policies. As local media reported Morrison was in Hawaii on a family holiday, about 500 protesters gathered outside his official Sydney residence to demand urgent action on climate change. Morrison\u2019s office refused to confirm his whereabouts. One protestor, wearing an Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, \u201cScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?\u201d referencing the leader\u2019s nickname and a decade-old international advertisement for Tourism Australia that was banned in several countries because the language was deemed offensive. Australia\u2019s low-lying Pacific neighbors have been particularly critical of the coal-rich nation\u2019s climate policies following modest progress at the U.N. climate talks in Madrid. \u201cIt was particularly disappointing to see our Pacific cousins in Australia actively standing in the way of progress at a time when we have been watching in horror as their own country is ablaze,\u201d Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine said in a statement on Wednesday.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":5884}
{"claim_id":"7757","hypothesis":"Poland's wild boar cull prompts protests.","explanation_1":"Hunters and activists have united against the Polish government\u2019s decision to cull most of Poland\u2019s wild boar population in an effort to curtail health risks related to African swine fever (ASF).","premise":"\u201cThere is no scientific basis for this, it is barbarism,\u201d said Katarzyna Karpa-Swiderek, a spokeswoman for animal rights organization World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Poland. \u201cWe broadly do not protest against hunting wild boars, but in our opinion the scope of the proposed cull is excessive.\u201d  Estimates of Poland\u2019s wild boar population vary widely and range from at least 200,000 to one million. In December, the government called on all licensed hunters to kill most of the wild boar population in order to prevent the further spread of African swine fever. ASF is a highly contagious disease that affects pigs and wild boar and has spread in Eastern Europe in recent years. It does not affect humans. The European Commission said on Thursday that a wild boar cull is the only appropriate way of dealing with the spread of African swine fever, Polish state news agency PAP reported on Friday. Hunters, however, branded this an excessive measure. \u201cIt is not possible to call it anything other than an animal slaughter. A significant number of hunters do not approve of these activities (the\u00a0wild\u00a0boar\u00a0cull),\u201d said hunter Wojciech Metler. Thousands of opponents of the cull have shown their support by changing their Facebook profile photos to ones that feature an image of a wild boar. Poland\u2019s veterinary officials approved a plan to kill 185,000\u00a0wild\u00a0boars in the 2018\/2019 hunting season. In 2018 the Supreme Audit Office concluded most farms did not implement sufficient preventive measures to stem the spread of the disease, such as installing disinfection mats.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":593}
{"claim_id":"4654","hypothesis":"Rejected medical marijuana grower applicant sues Missouri.","explanation_1":"A southwest Missouri family that saw its application to grow medical marijuana rejected by the state is now suing the state, demanding a license to participate in Missouri\u2019s fledgling medical cannabis industry.","premise":"The lawsuit filed Friday by Paul Callicoat and his family, of Sarcoxie, Missouri, came a day after the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services granted 60 licenses  from the more than 500 companies that applied. The Callicoats, who had planned to open a cultivation facility called Sarcoxie Nursery, were not among those who won a license. The family\u2019s lawsuit argues the state\u2019s 60-license limit violates the state constitution\u2019s \u201cright to farm\u201d amendment passed by voters in 2014. The lawsuit also challenges the state\u2019s selection process that gave more points to businesses in high-unemployment ZIP codes, saying that \u201cgeographic bonus\u201d was announced after the family had already paid a non-refundable $10,000 application fee. The health department did not respond to a request by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for comment. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Monday. Missouri voters made medical marijuana legal in 2018.

{"claim_id":"27739","hypothesis":"\"A billboard that says \"\"Make America White Again\"\" is part of a political campaign.\"","explanation_1":"The Ballotpedia web site records that Tyler ran for the same office in 2014 and received 5,579 votes, or 0.4% of the total votes cast.","premise":"On 22 June 2016, a photograph purportedly showing a billboard for a Congressional candidate named Rick Tyler, bearing the slogan \u00a0\u201cMake America White Again\u201d along with pictures of various white American historical figures and a white family was widely circulated via social media: Although the image was also published by several legitimate news outlets, many viewers remained skeptical that anyone running for Congress would employ a slogan that seemed so blatantly racist. According to Nashville television station WSMV the \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard was put on display off of Highway 411 in Polk County, Tennessee, by independent Rick Tyler,& who is\u00a0running for a congressional seat in Tennessee\u2019s 3rd district that is currently held by Republican Chuck Fleischmann. A (since-deleted) statement posted by Tyler explained the rationale behind the billboard from his point of view and offered a preview of putative future campaign billboards:  The \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard advertisement will cut to the very core and marrow of what plagues us as a nation. As Anne Coulter so effectively elucidates in her book, Adios America, the overhaul of America\u2019s immigration law in the 1960\u2019s has placed us on an inevitable course of demise and destruction. Yes \u2026 the cunning globalist\/Marxist social engineers have succeeded in destroying that great bulwark against statist tyranny \u2026 the white American super majority. Without its expedited restoration little hope remains for the nation as a whole. The following are examples of other billboard designs we plan to bring forth in the coming months. We ask you to prayerfully consider putting meaningful financial support behind this brazen and determined crusade for truth. The controversial billboard was apparently taken down on 21 June 2016, and Tyler\u2019s campaign web site has also been inaccessible since then (possibly due to an unexpected crush of traffic. Tyler offered a lengthy response to the brouhaha engendered by his campaign billboard in a (since-removed) Facebook post:  Let me begin by thanking everyone that has gotten involved in the controversy spawned by the \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard on Highway 411 in Polk County. I am persuaded that the overwhelming majority of you are sincere and well intentioned. Obviously, there are the \u201cfrothing at the mouth lunatics\u201d who react in a completely irrational, emotional, Pavlovian dog fashion. Fortunately, they are a small percentage of the whole\u2014and even they are passionately sincere albeit ignorant, misguided and lacking in self control. A PREDICTABLE AND DESIRED RESPONSE Be assured, the response that has been engendered by the billboard is precisely what was expected and hoped for. You see\u2026 this is not a mere publicity stunt, but rather a calculated maneuver to dispense hardcore truth while simultaneously doing an end run around the iron curtain of censorship. As Orwell stated, \u201cIn a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u201d Unfortunately, a globalist cartel has long held power in our nation, and in effect, there has already been a soft revolution wherein lawful constitutional government has been supplanted by a rogue band of oligarchic criminals. Those who seek to set things aright are actually counter-revolutionaries, endeavoring to facilitate the restoration of lawful, constitutional government. Whether you realize it or not, you are all participating in this counter-revolutionary exercise irrespective of where you stand on the matter! Indeed, the brainwashing may well be too far advanced, and there may be no chance of restoration, rejuvenation, and revival in our once great nation. Like the watchman spoken of in Ezekiel 33, some of us must sound the warning of the advancing and ominous peril that is encroaching upon our civilization as a whole. Like Nineveh, there could be great repentance and revival in America. If not, we will succumb to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. For those who are posturing in a high and mighty stance of ostensible moral superiority, I would caution you against falling into the trap of modernism and the liberal watering down of truth. Your fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers would have been entirely sympathetic and supportive of the preservation of a white super majority in America. They would have been utterly hostile to the concept of the mass nonwhite immigration that has ensued over the past half century. They would have never acquiesced to the schemes of forced racial integration foisted upon the states by a usurpatious federal government. By capitulating on these and other related issues, you are dishonoring your fathers and mothers of old in a flagrant and treacherous violation of the 4th Commandment. In the fulness of time, God will surely hold you accountable for this violation of his sacred law. As Isaiah 5:20 states, \u201cWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\u201d AM I A RACIST? The charge of \u201cracism\u201d is the most flagrant and abusive canard of our time. Absurdly, those who bandie about the charge never bother to define its meaning. Is a racist one who harbors antipathy toward someone simply based on their ethnicity? If so only a foolish person would fit such a description. If, on the other hand, we are talking about someone who demonstrates greater affinity for his own racial family (your race is the extension of your biological family) then the charge would be truly preposterous. Ethnocentricity is completely healthy and normal and all races, except the white race, are encouraged to engage in and express it. The glaring double standard is all too obvious. ABOUT THE BILLBOARD\u2019S MESSAGE The \u201cMake America White Again\u201d billboard is a takeoff on Donald Trump\u2019s slogan of \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d In a nutshell, it is stating that the \u201cLeave It to Beaver, Ozzie and Harriet, Mayberry\u201d America of old was vastly superior to what we are experiencing today. It was an America where doors were left unlocked, violent crime was a mere fraction of today\u2019s rate of occurrence, there were no car jackings, home invasions, Islamic Mosques or radical Jihadist sleeper cells. Additionally, government was much smaller, responsible, and accountable to the people. Yes, that Norman Rockwell America was immensely preferable to the rapidly deteriorating culture now engulfing us. Only the ignorant and misguided would resist its restoration and resuscitation. As set forth on the Tyler for Congress website, (www.ricktylerforcongress.com) a moratorium on nonwhite immigration and the abolition of policies that subsidize nonwhite birth rates would be two constructive actions toward beginning the long journey back toward sanity and stability in our beleaguered and foundering nation. A WHITE SUPER MAJORITY It is no coincidence that every nation being inundated by the teeming multitudes of the third world is a white nation. It is indisputable that the white race has achieved infinitely more in the way of technology, culture and innovation than the nonwhite civilizations of history. The racial component of this phenomenon is all-important. In a blind, suicidal manner modern man overlooks this profound truth while plunging headlong toward destruction. SOUNDING THE CLARION CALL The Caucasian race has been inordinately blessed and favored by the God of scripture. It was among this people that the new covenant gospel of Jesus Christ took root, blossomed, and flourished. Western Christian civilization evolved in the ensuing centuries leading to the eventual rise of our beloved America of yesteryear. As time progressed however, our nation and people lost their way. America forsook the God of her fathers and turned to the false gods of the heathen world. Now we are a people under divine judgment with a very grim future staring us in the face. The Tyler for Congress candidacy is a last ditch effort to challenge the descendents of America\u2019s founders to \u201creturn to the ancient landmarks.\u201d Scattered throughout the land are the proverbial seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal. (I Kings 19:18) The remnant of God may not be large enough to facilitate restoration of that which has been lost\u2026 but we will proceed to carry the torch in the hope of miraculous and divine intervention. The incumbent lawyer and representative of the 3rd Congressional District voted for the 1.1 trillion dollar spending bill in December; which among many nefarious expenditures allocated funding for the importation of 100,000 Syrian refugees, a large number of which are straight off of the Jihadist battlefield. A full-blown Muslim invasion is underway while a criminal, runaway federal government gobbles up what remains of liberty at breathtaking speed. CONCLUSION Amazingly, while being oblivious to the aforementioned circumstances plaguing our nation, a substantial number of low information citizens are easily whipped into a frenzy by the mythological enemy of \u201cracism.\u201d Sadly, it never occurs to the reactionary mob that they in fact, are guilty of the grievous sin of rejection of truth. Yet, just as Jesus was able to miraculously give sight to the blind, God is still in the business of peeling the scales off of men\u2019s eyes. Yes, he gives grace to the humble but resisteth the proud. (James 4:6.) Concerning the hostility emanating from various directions I would say the following: We believe in Libertarian principles of free speech and freedom of association. All are free to go where they desire as well as refrain from going where they do not want to be. Of course, these same individuals will continue to patronize all manner of franchises and national chains that truly are the embodiment of corruption and exploitation. Yet another example of hypocrisy and double-standards. Will the Rick Tyler for Congress campaign gain traction and become a force to be reckoned with? Only time will tell. When all is said and done however, the truth will prevail. Of that we can be assured.","label":0,"__index_level_0__":7654}
{"claim_id":"3381","hypothesis":"Legionnaires\u2019 cases may be linked to Chicago-area hospital.","explanation_1":"State health officials are investigating whether three cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease are linked to a suburban Chicago hospital.","premise":"The Illinois Department of Public Health said Friday the three people were all patients at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Chicago.

Patients will receive treatment free of charge for the first two weeks, he added. Thailand, which has a tradition of using cannabis to relieve pain and fatigue, legalized marijuana for medical use and research in 2017 to boost agricultural income. There are already around 25 cannabis clinics attached to general hospitals around the country but, unlike the newly-launched pilot clinic, they operate for just a few days a week due to a lack of specialized staff. The largest producer of medicinal cannabis is currently the health ministry\u2019s Government Pharmaceutical Organization. Kasetsart University\u2019s director of medical cannabis research, Natakorn Thasnas, told Reuters that the university would supply  2,200 kilograms of cannabis leaf to the ministry. Cannabis production, cultivation and sale has been limited to licensed Thai producers for the next four years to protect the domestic industry. Currently, only hospitals and research facilities are allowed to apply for cannabis production and extraction licenses, but the government is reviewing regulations to enable Thai businesses to apply for permits. Last year, Thailand dropped cannabis and hemp extracts from its narcotics list and proposed a draft law that would allow each household to grow six cannabis plants. Four types of drugs, containing different combinations of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psycho-active ingredient in cannabis, were given to patients to treat migraine, insomnia, neck pain and muscle stiffness, the ministry said in a statement. The pilot clinic, based in the Ministry of Public Health, expects to see between 200 to 300 patients daily. \u201cI was worried at first, but I studied the effects and decided it was better because its natural,\u201d said Waraporn Boonsri, 69, who received four vials of cannabis oil to help her sleep. Nearly 2,200 patients have registered at the clinic until March, a health official told Reuters. Anutin said there were plans for 77 clinics to be opened across the country, with one in every province.

{"claim_id":"34708","hypothesis":"Bride-to-be sends over-the-top list of instructions to her attendants.","explanation_1":"Those who\u2019ve yet to have their fill of bridezilla stories will find many, many more stashed in the archives of Etiquette Hell, your one-stop shop for horrifying accounts of people behaving badly.","premise":"We began seeing this intriguing letter in our inbox in February 2002, when countless readers began forwarding it to us to ask if it was the real thing. Was this yet another glimpse into the machinations of a \u201cbridezilla,\u201d a gal so caught up in the plans for her wedding that she turns into a monster? Or was it something else? Example: [Dear Abby, 2003] MEMO TO MY ATTENDANTS: Hey, girls! Mom has your dresses for the wedding. She\u2019ll bring them to the shower next weekend. You can pick them up there. Allison sent me an e-mail asking what style shoes and jewelry to wear. Great question, Allison! There are so many details. I keep forgetting to tell my girls what to do.This is an excellent opportunity to go over my expectations for each of you: About the shoes, please wear tasteful flats. Most of you are taller than me. I\u2019d rather you not all tower over me. I want all of you to wear your hair down. Since Babs and Allison have similar hair, I\u2019d prefer that Babs straighten hers and let Allison be the curly-haired girl. After all, she\u2019s my friend and you are just bridesmaids! I\u2019m sure you understand. Judy and Molly, you have both mentioned that you intend to shed a few pounds. This would be the perfect time! Watch your diets; we will all start weekly weigh-ins. Allison could use some trimming down, too. Also, you should all stay away from alcohol for at least a week before the wedding. None of us should be puffy or bloated. I think this is mainly for Babs, as none of my ladies drink all that much. Other than that, I don\u2019t have any real suggestions. Oh, please don\u2019t go tanning! I prefer to blend in with you than stand out as the pale one! Judy, Allison and Molly, please call me. There are a few other things that I need to go over with you on this topic. Babs, you are Scotty\u2019s friend, so I wouldn\u2019t presume to tell you what needs to be corrected \u2014 plus, your own wedding is coming up after mine. So I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already more than a little aware of what you need to work on. See y\u2019all on Saturday. Babs, remember you\u2019ll attend the shower with us girls rather than the paintball fun with the boys. Dress accordingly, dear! Bridezilla tales are nothing new to the Internet, and usually after blossoming briefly to horrify the masses, they quietly fade into obscurity. This one, however, gained a shot in the arm when it appeared in a Dear Abby column in September 2002. Readers sent the much-traveled e-mail to Abby, seeking her comments. She offered no opinion on whether the story was true but replied: If the document you sent me is on the level, the bride-to-be appears to have an abundance of unresolved control issues and an astounding lack of tact. Abby\u2019s observation was dead on. It also brings us back to the \u201cwas this for real or not?\u201d element of the tale. You see, if this had been a hoax, it would have been designed to make its purported author look especially heinous. And there\u2019s a strong chance that\u2019s exactly what happened. A couple of small sections of the earlier e-mail were left out of the Dear Abby version, namely: [Following \u201cMost of you are taller than me, so would rather you all not tower over me\u2019] Plus, many of you are unaware, but Addie is terribly ill and sometimes is paralyzed from the waist down. And we do want to take care of Adam\u2019s girl! [Following \u201cLindsay could use some trimming up too\u201d] Addie, you just take care of yourself. I know that some of us have trouble with food and I don\u2019t want to encourage any bad habits with those who have had problems in the past. (In the February 2002 original, all the participants had different names: The curly-haired friend was Lindsay instead of Allison; Leisha and Sissy were the gals who needed to lose weight, not Judy and Molly; Addie, instead of Babs, was the paintball-loving two-fisted drinker who was soon to marry the problematic Adam, not Scotty; and the now-nameless bride signed herself as Jenny.) A careful reading of the original reveals little digs are made at Addie (Babs) throughout the piece. Granted, brides do not always get along famously with their bridesmaids, but this level of barely suppressed hostility is unusual. The unrelenting Addie-bashing should sound a few distant warning bells in those tempted to take the letter at face value, because the behavior doesn\u2019t fit the occasion. Addie drinks too much, has \u201cfood problems,\u201d is marrying a loser, is dead from the waist down, should have her hair straightened because another bridesmaid preferred by the bride also has curly hair, and has to be reminded to dress properly for the shower on Saturday to head off her turning up in shorts and a dirty T-shirt. The letter wasn\u2019t so much an \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding and here\u2019s how I want to run it\u201d missive as it was a bashing of one girl. Some mailings identified the bridezilla in question, so we asked her about it. She replied that while she\u2019d been made the goat of this affair, she hadn\u2019t written the letter; the piece had been the work of a disgruntled ex-boyfriend of Addie\u2019s. This fellow had somehow gained access to Addie\u2019s e-mail account, fabricated a letter supposedly written by the bride, and propagated it as if it were something Addie had received and was now forwarding to others. In this way, everyone in Addie\u2019s address book got to see all the little digs at her. Is this a reasonable scenario? In an oddball way it is \u2014 it certainly better explains the \u201cAddie bashing\u201d element of the letter than does the \u201cbitchy bride\u201d construct. Bridezillas are generally far too lost in what\u2019s going on with them to spare much attention for any member of the wedding party other than themselves. A true bridezilla would barely recognize that her bridesmaids had lives outside of the wedding, let alone be capable of diverting the focus of attention from herself to any of them. Jenny\u2019s explanation may be plausible, but since we can\u2019t prove the story one way or the other, we\u2019ll leave this one marked as \u201cUndetermined.\u201d The letter in question appeared in the May 2002 issue of Cosmopolitan as a sidebar to a larger article about bridezillas. All the names were changed once again. The current bridezilla tale echoes an older e-mail similarly transmitted across the Internet in 1999. Please note that the claims of this letter\u2019s having been penned in all seriousness by a real bride have not been substantiated, but the piece did run in Harper\u2019s magazine in 1991. Harper\u2019s presented it as: \u201cFrom a letter sent by a Youngstown, Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers in 1976. Since then, copies of the six-page, single-spaced letter have been circulating nationally among engaged and newlywed couples.\u201d EDITORS NOTE: This is an actual 1976 letter from a Youngstown,Ohio, bride-to-be to her bridesmaids and ushers. Read it and count your blessings. (FROM HARPER\u2019S MAGAZINE)Dear Bridal Party: From time to time I will be dropping everyone a line or two to keep each of you informed about how the wedding plans are progressing so that no one thinks I have forgotten them and no one is in the dark. Bridesmaids: Each bridesmaid will receive her dress via mail from Priscilla of Boston sometime in January. This will give each of you enough time to have the dress \u201cprofessionally\u201d altered if need be. The dresses are chiffon \u201cPriscilla\u201d dresses and can be worn after the wedding. The right shoulder is bare and there is no sleeve on the left arm. Each has its own cape, which goes almost to the floor. The two matrons of honor will be in silver and the four bridesmaids in peppermint green. As of this date, I have not decided whether the two in silver will wear green gloves and the four in green silver gloves, but long gloves will be worn. I strongly suggest that each person shops now for the typical cloth \u201cclosed-toe\u201d shoe. Keep the heel size reasonable \u2013 of course, no platforms of any kind. Anyone having trouble with their legs should wear support hose. Ushers: Each usher will be dressed identically to the groom, best man, and the head groomsman: black tails. Be sure you have black silk socks and black dress shoes polished to a high shine. Reception Rehearsal: On Saturday afternoon (early) we will go to Powers Auditorium to practice for the reception that night after the wedding ceremony. Why? Well, there is a long staircase at the auditorium that will be put to full use: Each bridal-party couple will be introduced separately and will proceed down the first half of the staircase (accompanied by music). Upon reaching the platform in the middle of the stairs, the girl will be required to \u201cswirl\u201d from the right side of the steps and move to the left side, and her partner (an usher) will move to the right; then they will proceed down the second half of the stairs and take their positions for the Bridal Dance. Dancing: I will try to find a choreographer to help with the Bridal Dance \u2014 but each person can please do his or her part by learning to waltz correctly in three-quarter time. Now, when I say waltz, I do not in any way mean two steps here and two steps there, always standing in one spot. When we waltz it will be to \u201cTales of the Vienna Woods.\u201d Each usher will be twirling his partner while moving in a large circle and maintaining even spacing between each couple. Turn on some old-time movies and you can see how it is supposed to be done. But, PLEASE, PLEASE, practice now! Suggestion: Go take dancing lessons!! That\u2019s what we have to do!! Also, there will be some polkas, the Charleston, jitterbug, and others. These are not \u201crequired\u201d dances. There will not be any up-to-date dances. I personally dislike them and think they look terrible-they simply are not dances, in my estimation. Photographs: There will be plenty. First and foremost, there will be \u201csound motion pictures\u201d taken throughout the wedding ceremony, during the Bridal Dance, and while each bridal-party couple walks down the steps at the reception. Flash pictures will be taken in the church ONLY until my father and I arrive at the altar-after that there will be NO flash pictures; the official photographer will be taking time exposures. I believe it is the height of ill manners for any guest to leave his or her seat and proceed to the altar to take pictures. Dress Requirements: Makeup \u2014 It is requested that you wear a little more than usual because of the photographs and the movie pictures. Any ladies with short eyelashes are requested to wear either false eyelashes or go to a beauty parlor and have false eyelashes put in one by one. The matrons of honor wearing the silver dresses must have a lot of pink in their makeup. That is straight from Priscilla. Be sure that each of the four other bridesmaids has green eyeshadow and that every one wears blusher, powder, eyebrow pencil, foundation, lipstick, and mascara \u2014 the works!! There will be two experts in the field of makeup to help anyone who needs it or wants it. As for the men, ho, ho, you will have your turn also. If you have a shiny face, be sure to use some of your wife\u2019s face powder to take the shine away. For the wives and husbands of those who are in the wedding party: Ladies-the color of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses has been stated, and all that I ask is that your dress be a color that will not contrast with the peppermint green, that it is of full length, and fairly simple in line. Also, please do not wear an extensive amount of jewelry, as the bridesmaids will possibly wear only small pearl earrings. Be sure each of you has gloves. You need wear nothing in your hair. Men \u2014 Amy Vanderbilt\u2019s book on etiquette says that anyone receiving a formal invitation is to wear \u201cblack tie,\u201d which means tuxedo. Now, this could get rather touchy, so I will put it this way: If you do not wish to wear a tux, or do not wish to take on the expense of renting one, it will be perfectly fine to wear a \u201cblack\u201d suit, white shirt with French cuffs, black silk socks, black shoes, and a black-and-silver tie. I hope this doesn\u2019t inconvenience too many, but I would hate to look at color pictures of the head table and see some men in black tails and others in brown or blue suits!! Children at the Wedding or Reception: It is my wish, and also Z.\u2019s [the fianc\u00e9], that there be no children at the wedding ceremony or at the reception. For purposes of clarification, a child is anyone eighteen years or younger. There are many reasons for this request, but the best is the simple fact that I don\u2019t have the money to invite children who only pick at their food, cry, run around, etc. One friend of mine, who married about a year ago, says that when she got her wedding pictures back, there wasn\u2019t one that didn\u2019t have a kid in it and she was disgusted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, children are great. But there is a time and a place for them and this isn\u2019t it. This is an adult, ultra-formal affair and I want to keep it that way. One point of etiquette: When a formal invitation is sent out with Mr. and Mrs. Paul J. Smith on the outside envelope and Mr. and Mrs. Smith on the inside envelope, that is exactly what it means \u2014 only Mr. and Mrs. Smith are being invited and no one else; no others in the family, no guests who might be visiting at the time, etc. If asked about guests, you can \u201cdiplomatically\u201d pass this on. I know it sounds like I am being a real fusspot, but I would hate to tell each of you what the cost is per person just for the reception alone. I\u2019m doing this for my friends and relatives, for all of us to have a good time, but since there are only so many hours in the day, and I already have three jobs, and I am not a Vanderbilt, some lines must be drawn, and I hope everyone understands. I\u2019ve never wanted a small country-type wedding \u2014 Z. says this is no wedding but rather a coronation!! Well, not quite. But it sure has been fun so far, and I just cannot wait for everyone to arrive and for all our friends and relatives to have one great, fabulous night. Everyone think positive and keep your fingers crossed. Pray \u2014 that will bring more help. Won\u2019t each of you come with Z. and me to fantasyland \u2014 a place where dreams come true and fun abounds for everyone? Where the bride is Cinderella and the groom is Cinderfella for an evening. You are going to attend a ball at \u201cBuckingham Palace\u201d (pretend) and the King and Queen have invited only \u201croyalty\u201d \u2014 YOU! This will be a time to remember when you were courting the person to whom you are now married-a time to take a second honeymoon. We want everyone to be as happy as we are and to rekindle (add extra \u201cfire\u201d to) their own marriages. If you have a happy marriage now (which I know you all do), we expect the Palace to be really electrified with all that LOVE. May your every dream come true!","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4864}
{"claim_id":"34436","hypothesis":"A blow to the testicles can kill a man.","explanation_1":"While there have been cases in both the media and the scientific literature that report a connection between testicular trauma and fatalities, these case reports are speculative, sparse, and do not provide enough information to confidently demonstrate the mechanisms hypothesized behind them. A kick in the balls may lead to serious complications, but most urologists agree that death is not one of them.","premise":"Kicking, punching, or squeezing testicles has long been prized as an effective means to briefly incapacitate men, as it brings about a powerful full-body pain. The reasons for such a blow\u2019s power stems from the lack of protection the testes receive from the scrotum, the high concentration of pain receptors called nociceptors surrounding them, and the myriad interconnections between testicular nerves and organs throughout your body. The pain, medically called\u00a0\u201cblunt scrotal trauma,\u201d typically subsides without incident. However, more serious complications can arise with enough force. Have such injuries resulted in death? Potentially, though most agree that other exacerbating factors have to be considered in addition to the testicular trauma. Perhaps one the earliest purported cases of death resulting from injury to the testicle was found in a brief but terrifying case report\u00a0from 1843,\u00a0which reads: In some parts of Germany a barbarous custom exists, in cases of quarrel, of violently compressing the testicles. M. Schlesier, of Peitz, relates a case of sudden death from this species of injury. The patient fell to the ground, was seized with violent convulsions, and died in a few minutes. Without further information, it is impossible to say what exactly happened in that specific incident. The reported heart attack suffered by thirteen-year-old boy whose testicles were squeezed as part of a schoolyard prank in 2014, however, may be illustrative of how (under rare and specific extenuating circumstances) stress from that kind of trauma could result in an immediate reaction similar to the 19th-century German account. Speaking to Vice News about the\u00a02014 incident, Dr. Marc Bjurlin, a clinical instructor in Urologic Oncology at New York University, said that he can \u201conly speculate\u201d that the teenager had a hidden condition: \u201cIf that\u2019s true in the case, I suspect the boy had an underlying etiology and that the scrotal injury, perhaps from the pain, resulted in a vasovagal response which may have lowered his blood pressure and exacerbated a cardiac etiology,\u201d Bjurlin said. The sheer pain response from having one\u2019s testicles yanked is more than enough to exacerbate any number of underlying conditions, he said. A 2008\u00a0case report of a different thirteen-year-old who had been kicked in the groin during a football game\u00a0describes how he came down with a life-threatening, infection-mimicking condition called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) after the trauma. This case report concluded that death from testicular trauma is a possibility that must be considered: In our case, the patient initially presented with a minor scrotal injury; swelling and pain without ecchymosis were the only symptoms. Then, without evidence of infection, he gradually progressed to a life-threatening condition, unresponsive to empiric antibiotics and standard fluid resuscitation. Now recovered, the patient continues to be monitored for any long-term consequences of his injury. Initially patients with acute scrotal pain are told to look for signs of injury and infection, but they should also be aware of the signs of sepsis and SIRS. Although rare, death is no longer beyond the realm of consequences from testicular injury and physicians must be prepared to deliver appropriate care. SIRS was, additionally, blamed for the death of an eighteen-year-old male in India who injured himself riding a bicycle: Few cases of acute scrotal pain might lead to Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which is a life threatening condition. We report a case of an 18 year old boy who sustained testicular trauma while riding a bicycle and two months post trauma developed severe pain in left inguino-scrotal region, fever and subsequently died. The authors intend to report this unusual case as cases of testicular trauma resulting in shock and SIRS have been reported in literature but were unable to find cases of death occurring due to SIRS. Outside these rare (and still somewhat ill-defined) examples, the most plausible complications from testicular trauma are generally not life-threatening, though some (most notably trauma-induced testicular torsion) can lead to a loss of fertility or even the removal of a testicle if not properly treated. A 2004 consensus paper in BJU International outlined the potential injuries as a result of testicular trauma: Blunt trauma may cause local haematoma, ecchymosis of the scrotum, or injuries to the testicle, epididymis or spermatic cord. In testicular rupture the tunica albuginea is disrupted, while in intratesticular haematoma the tunica albuginea remains intact. Haematoceles, in which blood accumulates in the space between the tunica albuginea and tunica vaginalis, and hydroceles, can be the result of trauma. Traumatically induced testicular torsion is another well recognized entity.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":5071}

Don\u2019t worry, we still aim to keep the spirit of the story alive and ensure it remains as hilarious as ever! The stories published on Not Always Learning are user-submitted anecdotes meant to entertain readers. While the editors supposedly endeavor to ensure stories are based on real events, an amusing story clearly takes precedence over a factual one. Which brings us back to the content of \u201cWas Bra-ced for a Different Reaction.\u201d The story is filled with unnecessary detail to make the mother character the only credible voice; for instance, the story gives plenty of detail about the mother\u2019s heroic work in the A&E (accident and emergency room), while the other characters are painted as ignorant and incompetent:  Me: \u201cOh. And you want to know if I\u2019m going to press charges against him for sexually assaulting my daughter and against the school for allowing him to do it?\u201d (They all get jittery when I mention sexual assault and start speaking at once.) Teacher: \u201cI don\u2019t think it was that serious.\u201d Head Of Year: \u201cLet\u2019s not over-react.\u201d Head: \u201cI think you\u2019re missing the point.\u201d (The boy\u2019s mother then starts crying. I turn to my daughter to find out what happened.) Daughter: \u201cHe kept pinging my bra. I asked him to stop but he didn\u2019t, so I told Mr. [Teacher]. He told me to \u2018ignore it.\u2019 [Boy] did it again and undid my bra so I hit him. Then he stopped.\u201d (I turn to the teacher.) Me: \u201cYou let him do this? Why didn\u2019t you stop him? Come over here and let me touch the front of your trousers.\u201d Teacher: \u201cWhat?! No!\u201d Me: \u201cDoes that seem inappropriate to you? Why don\u2019t you go and pull on Mrs. [Head Of Year]\u2019s bra right now. See how fun it is for her. Or on that boy\u2019s mum\u2019s bra. Or mine. You think just because they\u2019re kids it\u2019s fun?\u201d  The mother\u2019s quick retorts also seem implausible. The story depicts a very frustrating situation, yet the mother manages to find the perfect words at every turn. While this is possible, it seems more likely that the story was written after the incident as the writer recalled exactly what she should have said. There\u2019s no English word for this concept: the French use the term \u201cesprit de l\u2019escalier,\u201d the Germans know it as treppenwitz, and fans of Seinfeld call it the Jerk Store Paradox. The story concludes with a final speech about sexual assault from this enraged mother as she scolds the teacher and the headmaster, threatens \u201cboy,\u201d and takes \u201cdaughter\u201d out of the office:  Head: \u201cMrs. [My Name]. With all due respect, [Daughter] still beat another child.\u201d Me: \u201cNo. She defended herself against a sexual attack from another pupil. Look at them; he\u2019s nearly 6 feet and 11 or 12 stone. She\u2019s 5 feet and 6 stone. He\u2019s a foot taller than her and twice as heavy. How many times should she have let him touch her? If the person who was supposed to help and protect her in a classroom couldn\u2019t be bothered what should she have done? He pulled her bra so hard it came undone.\u201d (The boy\u2019s mum is still crying and his dad looks both angry and embarrassed. The teacher won\u2019t make eye contact with me. I look at the headmaster.) Me: \u201cI\u2019m taking her home. I think the boy has learnt his lesson. And I hope nothing like this ever happens again, not only to [Daughter], but to any other girl at this school. You wouldn\u2019t let him do it to a member of staff so what makes you think he can do it to a girl of 15 is beyond me. I will be reporting this to the governors. And if you\u2013\u201d *turning to the boy* \u201c\u2013EVER touch my daughter again I WILL have you arrested for sexual assault. Do you understand me?\u201d (I was so angry I gathered my daughter\u2019s things and left. I reported it to the Board of Governors, several of whom I know from Church (it\u2019s a Catholic school), and was assured it would be strongly dealt with. I also reported it to OFSTED (Government-run school monitoring) and they were equally as horrified and assured me they would contact the school. My daughter was put into a different class for that subject, away from the teacher and the boy.)","label":1,"__index_level_0__":7162}

He said his opinions of the allegations against Kavanaugh have been shaped by personal experience. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve had a lot of false charges made against me,\u201d Trump said.Trump claimed that \u201cfour or five women\u201d who have accused him \u201cgot paid a lot of money to make up stories.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence of that.Trump, Sept. 26: I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. They refused to even write about it.There were four women, and maybe more \u2014 I think the number is four or five. But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000. Another one had other things happen. And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me \u2014 and she is the one that reported it. This woman is incredible. She reported it, instead of taking the money.Trump appears to be referring to a story, first reported by the Hill, in December 2017, about payments California-based attorney Lisa Bloom acknowledged arranging for two of her four clients who accused Trump of sexual harassment and assault. (At least 18 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, according to Time.) But the article didn\u2019t say the women were asked to \u201cmake up stories\u201d about Trump in exchange for money, as the president said. In fact, the Hill reported that the two women \u201cstressed that Bloom never asked them to make any statements or allegations except what they believed to be true.\u201dIn one case, Bloom set up a GoFundMe account that aimed to raise $10,000 \u2014 but has so far only collected around $2,600 \u2014 to help support Jill Harth, a client who alleged that Trump groped her in 1992 and again in 1993. \u201cShe endured a tidal wave of hate for it,\u201d Bloom said in a statement to the Hill. \u201cIt was very painful for her. And as a New York City makeup artist, Jill lost jobs after she came out publicly against Donald Trump. I believed that people wanted to donate to help her, so we set up the GoFundMe account.\u201dThe Hill reported that Bloom also secured for Harth \u201ca small payment from the licensing of some photos to the news media,\u201d and arranged for an unidentified donor to pay off the mortgage on Harth\u2019s apartment in Queens. The amount for the mortgage \u201cwas under $30,000,\u201d according to the article, not $52,000, as Trump claimed.The Hill said that Harth spoke publicly about Trump\u2019s alleged harassment only after her name and the details of the 1997 lawsuit she filed against him surfaced in news reports during the summer before the 2016 election. The fact that Harth filed suit in 1997 undercuts Trump\u2019s claim now that she was paid to make up stories about him. \u201cShe asked Bloom to represent her in the fall after hearing Trump describe her allegations against him as false,\u201d the paper said.\u201cNothing that you\u2019ve said to me about my mortgage or the Go Fund Me that was created to help me out financially affects the facts or the veracity of my 1997 federal complaint,\u201d Harth said in a statement to the Hill.In the other case, a woman who requested to remain anonymous told the Hill that Bloom said she could get as much as $750,000 for \u201cgoing public with an allegation of an unsolicited advance by Trump on the 1990s beauty contest circuit.\u201d That was actually much lower than the $2 million the woman had requested, citing concerns for her safety, Bloom said. (The woman didn\u2019t dispute the claim that she asked for $2 million. The Hill said she acknowledged trying to see how much she could get or discover who was donating the money. )The woman actually supported Trump in 2016, and said \u201cshe held no resentment about the early 1990s advance because Trump stopped it as soon as she asked him,\u201d the Hill said.She had been contemplating sharing her story about Trump in order to support her friend Harth, who had put her in contact with Bloom\u2019s law firm. She changed her mind several times about coming forward, but ultimately decided not to go public with her accusation. She later approached the Hill with information about Bloom\u2019s financial offers after she learned that Bloom had been representing disgraced film executive Harvey Weinstein, who also has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.Furthermore, it isn\u2019t exactly accurate that \u201cmainstream media refused to put\u201d the story on TV, or \u201ceven write about it,\u201d as Trump claimed. Perhaps no news outlet gave the story as much time as conservative commentator Sean Hannity did on his Fox News Channel show on Dec. 15, 2017. But ABC News did air a segment featuring Bloom\u2019s response to the Hill\u2019s report on the weekend edition of \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Dec. 16, 2017. The New York Times also included some details about Bloom attempting to arrange payments for clients in a Dec. 31, 2017, story about how \u201cpolitical partisans\u201d on the left and right were \u201craising hundreds of thousands of dollars to support accusers who come forward with charges against President Trump and members of Congress, even amid questions about their motivation.\u201dThat Times story mentioned that women\u2019s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who is Bloom\u2019s mother, also raised money for her then-client Summer Zervos, who alleged that Trump kissed and groped her without consent on separate occasions in New York and Los Angeles. Zervos competed on Trump\u2019s old reality TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Her defamation lawsuit against Trump, who called her allegations lies, is still ongoing. Earlier this month, lawyers for Trump and Zervos agreed their clients would provide sworn answers to written questions by Sept. 28. Trump said another woman told a \u201ctotal phony story\u201d about how he \u201cattacked her while people were coming onto a plane.\u201d That\u2019s not how she described the assault.Trump: It\u2019s happened to me many times. I\u2019ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane. And I have a number-one bestseller out? I mean it was total phony story. There are many of them.In October 2016, Jessica Leeds told the New York Times that Trump \u201cgrabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt,\u201d according to the paper. She said this happened over three decades earlier, when she was sitting next to Trump in first class on a flight to New York.She never claimed it happened as \u201cpeople were coming onto the plane,\u201d as Trump said. According to the article, the alleged incident happened around 45 minutes into the flight. She alleges Trump moved the armrest and then touched her, causing her to run to the back of the plane. The Times said it spoke with four other people with whom Leeds had shared her story.Trump\u2019s campaign later offered its own witness, Anthony Gilberthorpe, who said he saw Leeds and Trump interacting on the plane and that Trump did not make sexual advances on her. \u201cIt was she that was the one being flirtatious,\u201d Gilberthorpe said, according to a note the Trump campaign provided to the New York Post.In his press conference, Trump suggested he would never have done what Leeds described because he had \u201ca number-one best-seller out\u201d at the time. But Gilberthorpe claimed he was on the flight with Trump and Leeds in 1980 or 1981. Trump\u2019s first book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which he wrote with journalist Tony Schwartz, wasn\u2019t published until 1987.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":4439}

{"claim_id":"34383","hypothesis":"Coconut oil is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.","explanation_1":"There are plausible mechanisms behind the notion that coconut oil could help with Alzheimer's, but the research is in its infancy.","premise":"The cause of Alzheimer\u2019s is unknown, although theories abound. Some\u00a0evidence\u00a0suggests that one cause could be related to lack of glucose metabolism in certain parts of the brain, as\u00a0described\u00a0in a 2014 case study published in\u00a0Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience: The brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body, and under most conditions, relies almost exclusively on glucose for its energy needs. Using [a chemical tracer], the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) can be measured. [Chemical tracer] studies in the early 1980s compared AD subjects with normal controls and found significant diminished cerebral glucose metabolism (DCGM) in AD patients. Coconut oil contains relatively high levels of medium-chain fatty acids, which break down into ketones in your stomach. Ketones can also be used as a source of energy for the brain (a process called ketosis) and there are at least some suggestions that ketones can help pick up the slack in a glucose-deprived brain suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s. A 2014\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0Neurobiology Aging\u00a0compared the cognitive effects of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s after being treated with either a single dose of a specific chain fatty acid found in coconut oil, or a placebo: A single 40\u2009g dose of [caprylic triglyceride, a fatty acid] induced mild ketosis and a significant positive correlation between performance on [a] paragraph recall task and [concentrations of ketones in the blood] was found. The scientific research in this area is in its infancy, and claims that coconut oil specifically, or ketosis in general, can play a role in ameliorating the affects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease require more research.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":7688}
{"claim_id":"34697","hypothesis":"NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre was disqualified from the draft due to a psychological condition.","explanation_1":"A years-old Internet rumor suggests the gun rights figurehead may not be mentally sound enough to pass a background check.","premise":"It was originally organized in 1871 to \u201cpromote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis\u201d in the United States, and it seems to have succeeded; generations later, the National Rifle Association\u00a0has become the United States\u2019 most high-profile gun rights lobbying group. The organization\u2019s executive vice president and CEO is Wayne R. LaPierre, an outspoken defender of the Second Amendment and critic of all but the most minimal gun control policies. In the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 which resulted in the deaths of more than two dozen children and adults, LaPierre famously suggested\u00a0that a \u201cnational database of lunatics\u201d would do more to solve the nation\u2019s gun violence problem than banning the assault-style weapons so often used in such crimes. LaPierre\u2019s repeated assertions linking gun violence with mental illness (assertions vigorously challenged\u00a0by mental health professionals) appear to have backfired on him, at least on the Internet, supplying fodder for rumors and memes promoting the claim that he obtained a medical (4-F) draft deferment during the Vietnam War by reason of a \u201cnervous disorder.\u201d Most variants state or imply that he actually faked the condition: NRA President Wayne LaPierre rec\u2019d Viet Nam draft deferment for mental illness labeled \u201cnervous disorder\u201d.

Coward with a gun. Great combo #NRAFail \u2014 Progressive Texas (@ProgressiveTex) February 8, 2013  NRA Lapierre dodged Vietnam draft by claiming \u201cnervous disorder\u201d. Due to this mental illness, it\u2019s time to give his guns back #gunsense : \u2014 US Gun Violence (@usgunviolence6) January 3, 2017  Although we were unable to ascertain precisely when or where this claim first appeared, it dates back at least as far as 2006, when the following entry was added to an informal online database\u00a0called \u201cWho Served in the Military?\u201d: Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association\u00a0\u2014 did not serve (apparently pulled lottery #97 in 1969 as a campus radical at SUNY-Albany, but weaseled out by getting a family doctor to claim he had a nervous disorder). No sources were cited to corroborate this entry. According to the registrar\u2019s office of the State University of New York in Albany, Wayne LaPierre never attended the school. On the contrary, after graduating from Patrick Henry High School in Roanoke, Virginia in 1967, LaPierre entered Siena College in Loudonville, New York, from which (according to a\u00a0statement from the college) he graduated in 1972. He went on to earn a postgraduate degree at Boston College. Given his birthdate (8 November 1949), LaPierre would indeed have been assigned the number 97 in the first-ever Selective Service lottery of the Vietnam era, placing him in the \u201cmost likely to be drafted\u201d category for 1970. However, we\u2019ve found no public record or published mention of LaPierre ever having served in the military. Our queries to the NRA public affairs office concerning Mr. LaPierre\u2019s military service and\/or draft deferment status went unanswered. We were able to obtain Wayne LaPierre\u2019s Selective Service record from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, however. It shows that he registered for the draft on 13 November 1967, a few days after his 18th birthday, listing his occupation as \u201cstudent.\u201d Under the rules then in force, a registrant could qualify for a student deferment \u201cif he could show he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress in virtually any field of study,\u201d the Selective Service web site says. LaPierre\u2019s Selective Service classification record shows that he was classified 2-S (registrant deferred because of activity in study) in January 1968. His student deferment was renewed every year through 1970. Although the student deferment should have kept him immune from the draft until he graduated in 1972, the record states that LaPierre reported for an armed services physical exam in August 1971 (while still at Siena College), and shortly thereafter was reclassified 1-Y (registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency). During the Vietnam War period, receiving a 1-Y classification was essentially the same as being classified 4-F (registrant not qualified for military service). The 1-Y deferment was eliminated at the end of 1971, at which time all registrants who had previously received it, LaPierre among them, were administratively reclassified 4-F. Like that of Donald Trump, who also received a 1-Y draft deferment, LaPierre\u2019s classification record includes the notation \u201cyxx,\u201d meaning he was found unqualified for military service based on medical reasons. However, it does not state the exact nature of the disqualifying condition(s). We can confirm, then, that in NRA executive president Wayne LaPierre received a medical deferment from the draft in 1971, but to date no evidence has come to light proving it was because of a \u201cnervous disorder\u201d (feigned or real), or any other psychological condition.","label":1,"__index_level_0__":8743}
{"claim_id":"21407","hypothesis":"\"Mary Taylor Says that even if you have no children, \"\"under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it.\"","explanation_1":"Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor says 'Obamacare' would require purchase of unnecessary insurance","premise":"\"Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor also heads the state Department of Insurance. She makes no secret of her dislike for what she derisively calls \"\"Obamacare,\"\" the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In June, Taylor wrote a guest column for newspapers in which she said, \"\"I will do everything I can to protect Ohio\u2019s citizens and job creators from this catastrophic law.\"\" She followed it by giving a speech with a similar theme. In another guest column for newspapers that was posted Sept. 8 to the Department of Insurance website, Taylor says the health care law will limit choice and increase cost for consumers. \"\"The law\u2019s heavy-handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want,\"\" she wrote. \"\"Say for example, you do not have any children. Under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it. \"\"Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach. By requiring consumers to buy services they do not want or need, costs will rise significantly.\"\" That got PolitiFact Ohio\u2019s attention. Would consumers really be forced to buy unnecessary coverage, like pediatric, maternity and newborn care for people with no children? We asked Taylor's office for support. We were referred to Section 1302 of the Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. \"\"It addresses the essential health benefits,\"\" a spokesman for Taylor said. We read Section 1302, and it seemed to bear out Taylor's assertion. But we were frankly confused by the wording, and we turned for guidance to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source on health care issues. \"\"It is true that this (pediatric, maternity and newborn care) is covered as part of the essential benefits package,\"\" a spokesman told us. \"\"The law does mandate that insurance.\"\" But the spokesman added more: Current employer-provided insurance plans \"\"may include coverage you will never use or need, such as maternity care for a man or prostate cancer coverage for women.\"\" Wanting further explanation, we talked with Neera Tanden, who worked on the health care legislation as senior advisor for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services. She is currently CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \"\"Ninety percent of all plans cover everything described in the bill as 'essential health benefits package,\"\" she said. \"\"People are paying for all those benefits today. We all pay for things we never use. It is the nature of insurance.\"\" Individual policies are usually more expensive, offer fewer benefits and are less regulated than group plans, she said, noting that Section 1302 of the health care act says that the scope of the package should equal the scope of benefits \"\"under a typical employer plan.\"\" The act also bans exclusions for \"\"preexisting conditions\"\" that exclusively or primarily affect women and ends the practice of charging women higher premiums than men, she said. \"\"The thrust of (Taylor's) case is there should be no requirements on what insurance companies offer,\"\" Tanden said. Wanting the perspective of an authority without a dog in the political fight, we turned to J.B. Silvers at Case Western Reserve University. He is professor of health care finance and professor of banking and finance at the Weatherhead School of Management, faculty director of the Health Systems Management Center and holds a joint appointment in the School of Medicine. He also is former CEO of a health plan and insurance company. Silvers said the health care plan \"\"makes the playing field level\"\" by setting a standard for benefit packages. \"\"It is true you could buy some sort of stripped-down policy,\"\" he said, but such plans are \"\"almost universally a bad deal\"\" with higher costs. Normally, he said, a company negotiates coverage for employees, and \"\"wouldn't offer one plan for single males and another for people with families.\"\" What does that say about the accuracy of Taylor's statement? \"\"It's irrelevant,\"\" Silvers said. \"\"It's a silly argument, frankly. Insurance by definition includes things you don't think you need.\"\" What it means to us is that Taylor, the top official at the state department that oversees insurance, was accurate in describing provisions of what she calls Obamacare. But it is misleading to imply that health insurance policies are purchased a la carte, that such purchasing would reduce costs to consumers, and that the \"\"essential benefits package\"\" represents a departure from current group plans. And when a statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, it rates  on the Truth-O-Meter.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6848}

That's \"\"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure,\"\" said\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. Although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually. Estimates for the mortality rate for coronavirus are currently around 2%, but this number could change depending on how cases are diagnosed.\"","premise":"\"During a Senate appropriations Feb. 25 subcommittee hearing, Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, said the U.S. flu mortality rate was about the same as the current estimated global mortality rate of the coronavirus outbreak. He made this statement during an exchange with Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) regarding what the acting secretary knew about the coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. This C-SPAN video shows the full discussion between the two. Kennedy first asked what the worldwide mortality rate for coronavirus is, to which Wolf responded, that it was \"\"under 2%\"\" but that he would need to check with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get the actual figure and that \"\"it changes daily.\"\" The Louisiana senator then asked, \"\"What\u2019s the mortality rate for influenza over, say, the last 10 years in America?\"\" Wolf answered: \"\"It\u2019s also right around that percentage as well. I don\u2019t have that offhand, but it\u2019s right around 2% as well.\"\" We asked the Department of Homeland Security where Wolf\u2019s figure came from. A DHS spokesperson said in an email, \"\"As the acting secretary said in his hearing, he did not have that information on hand and refers to Health and Human Services -- the federal agency in charge of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus response.\"\" The comparison of coronavirus to flu in terms of mortality rates seemed like an important mechanism to understanding the growing concern about the reach of coronavirus, so we decided to dig deeper to find out if these statistics hold up. We also asked experts to explain what the numbers mean in terms of risk. Digging into mortality rate numbers The CDC directed us to its online influenza resources and referred us to the World Health Organization for more information on coronavirus. Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University, helped make sense of some of the figures. He calculated the average, 10-year mortality rate for flu using CDC data and found it was 0.1%. That 0.1% rate is frequently cited among experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, called it \"\"sort of the canonical seasonal influenza mortality figure.\"\" It\u2019s important to note, that although this percentage seems like a small number, influenza is responsible for an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 deaths annually. Now, for coronavirus. According to statistics released Feb. 17 by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for coronavirus was 2.3%. That\u2019s based on cases reported through Feb. 11 and calculated by dividing the numbers of coronavirus-related deaths at the time (1,023) by the number of the confirmed cases (44,672) of the coronavirus. (These numbers reflect the information available at the time of the secretary\u2019s testimony.) But this report has limitations, Mores said, including the vague way Chinese officials are defining who has been infected by the coronavirus. \"\"We have not been able to understand what precisely has gone on there,\"\" said Mores. \"\"They have changed their case definitions multiple times. It\u2019s murky what has gone into the case count and who has gone into being counted on cases.\"\" The WHO said in a press conference Monday that in Wuhan, China, the city where the virus first hit, the mortality rate ranged from 2% to 4%. Officials said that in the rest of China, outside of Wuhan, the mortality rate of coronavirus is 0.7%. Mike Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the mortality rate in China has since risen to 0.9%. Right now he doesn\u2019t see a similarity in the flu mortality rate and the coronavirus mortality rate. \"\"We don\u2019t have any evidence to that being the case,\"\" said Osterholm. Mores said U.S. health officials just don\u2019t have enough information to know whether the two mortality rates are similar. Understanding this comparison would offer a means to better understand the severity of the coronavirus. It could also help in educating the public about the novel illness. \"\"Until we can gain our own experience with this virus, it\u2019s going to be pretty squishy. So, all the numbers that you have come across here are within the range of possibility,\"\" he said. \"\"Absolutely, the hope is we will end up with something similar to the flu, but we just don\u2019t know yet.\"\" Multiple experts told us that the number of coronavirus cases not just in China but worldwide has probably been undercounted because many people with the infection do not suffer serious symptoms and may not seek medical treatment. It is possible that only those who have tested positive are being counted as \"\"confirmed cases.\"\" Until the case definition is expanded, they said, to include people clinicians think may have COVID-19 but who were not tested for it, then the total estimated number of cases will remain lower than the likely reality. But, if the number of cases widens to include those with mild symptoms who have not been tested, then the mortality rate will go down. This is the way mortality rates are calculated for the flu, said Mores. The numbers of flu illnesses and deaths are estimates based not only on positive flu tests, but also on doctors\u2019 suspicions and symptomatic diagnosis. One key difference between the flu and the coronavirus illness, Osterholm cautioned, is that, with the flu, the population has a partially built up immunity, whether through receiving flu shots or already having been exposed to the illness. Mores concurred. \"\"You know, the risk is this: We have a brand-new virus in a completely naive population on Earth, we\u2019re all susceptible to it. Everyone is potentially infectable with this virus,\"\" he said. \"\"Even with a high transmission rate and the low case fatality rate, that still becomes a massive number of ill and fatal cases.\"\" Our ruling There are two ways to parse out this claim: First, is it true that the average U.S. mortality rate for flu is 2%? That\u2019s not true, according to data from the CDC and exchanges with multiple global health experts. On average, the flu mortality rate during the past 10 years has been 0.1%. In addition, Wolf and a DHS spokesperson admitted that the acting secretary did not have the statistics in front of him when he answered questions at the hearing about the mortality rates. Second, is it true the COVID-19 mortality rate is similar to the flu mortality rate? Wolf is also wrong on that account, based on the limited information currently known about the coronavirus. Recent data from the Chinese government set the COVID-19 mortality rate at 2.3%. That\u2019s vastly different from the flu\u2019s mortality rate of 0.1%. Experts also said that while it\u2019s possible the mortality rate from the new virus could come close to the flu\u2019s mortality rate eventually \u2015 if the case definition of coronavirus is expanded -- it\u2019s too soon to make that assumption with the limited information available.\"","label":2,"__index_level_0__":112}
{"claim_id":"11248","hypothesis":"Acupuncture Eases Depression in Pregnancy","explanation_1":"This story reports on a small, randomized trial evaluating acupuncture for the treatment of depression in pregnant women. This story has numerous flaws, the biggest of which was relying heavily on the press release. By relying on a news release for quotes, this story missed some of the caveats and words of caution from researchers and independent experts that we saw in other stories.","premise":"There was no discussion regarding the cost of acupuncture, a particularly important omission since acupuncture is not covered by all insurance companies. The story tells the us that acupuncture significantly improved symptoms compared to the other treatment groups, but then it states that there was no difference in remission rates. A discussion on what this mixed outcome means would have been\u00a0useful. While acupuncture is generally safe, the story should have mentioned that 21 women in the study reported transient pain at the site of needle insertion and 1 woman experienced bleeding. The story did a nice job describing the study methods, pointing out that the patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group and that the people measuring their outcome were not aware which treatment the patients were receiving. These are all signs of a rigorous study design, but the story does not tell the reader why these methods are so\u00a0important. The story also should have noted that a study with 150 participants is still relatively small. This story indicates that 14% of pregnant women may suffer from depression; however, the writer might have also noted that 3-5% of pregnant women have actually been diagnosed. No independent experts were interviewed for this story.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":8971}

","explanation_1":"A major wildfire threatened thousands of homes and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Los Angeles on Wednesday as the fiercest Santa Ana winds yet lashed Southern California, forcing meteorologists to create new alert levels to warn of the danger.","premise":"The blaze erupted early on Wednesday morning in Simi Valley, northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, and by nightfall had charred 1,300 acres (526 hectares) as crews fought to protect the Reagan library and some 7,000 homes in the path of the flames. The Easy Fire, which forced 26,000 people to flee, broke out some 30 miles (48 km) from a separate conflagration burning in shrub-covered hills near the Getty Center museum that has displaced thousands of residents from some of the city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. The Getty museum houses a collection that includes paintings by Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Manet, ancient Greek statues and an expansive array of manuscripts. The Reagan Library, Getty Center and Getty Villa in Malibu were all forced to close due to the flames and thick clouds of smoke, although all three facilities were said to be out of imminent danger by evening. \u201cThe dedication of our staff and the professionalism of our region\u2019s first responders has been nothing short of heroic,\u201d  Getty president Jim Cuno said in a statement posted on the center\u2019s website. The Santa Ana winds were blamed for a string of fire outbreaks across Southern California. In Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, a wind-driven brush fire swiftly blackened 250 acres (101 hectares), forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people from two mobile home parks and a nursing home, county fire spokesman Rob Roseen said. Weather conditions were at their worst, with fierce winds hurling burning embers through the air across bone-dry brush to ignite spot fires. \u201cThe fire outflanked us very rapidly today, pushed by those 40- to 50-mile-per-hour (40- to 80 km per hour) winds,\u201d Ventura County Fire Department assistant chief Chad Cook told reporters. \u201cWe did experience gusts up to 65 miles per hour (105 kph) this morning, which made long-range spotting very, very dangerous.\u201d  He said erratic, high winds also forced intermittent grounding of firefighting aircraft through the day. The National Weather Service issued an unprecedented \u201cextreme red flag\u201d warning for wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties ahead of two days of intense, dry wind gusts that were forecast to reach near-hurricane force. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen us use this warning,\u201d forecaster Marc Chenard said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d   Statewide, the weather service issued alerts for \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d fire hazards covering more than 34,000 square miles (88,000 square km), encompassing some 21 million people. Power was cut off to nearly 400,000 homes and businesses statewide on Wednesday as a precaution by the state\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co, a unit of PG&E Corp (PCG.N), and other utilities. The so-called Easy fire in Simi Valley broke out just before dawn off a road named Easy Street, sending a wall of flames racing across scrub-covered slopes at the edge of the hilltop Reagan Library, which houses the late president\u2019s archives and memorabilia. Pre-positioned strike teams of firefighters, backed by water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers dumping payloads of fire retardant, swarmed the area as flames closed in on the library campus. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded. It\u2019s a scary situation. But I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get on top of it,\u201d John Heubusch, the library\u2019s executive director, said in an interview with KNX radio in Los Angeles during the firefight. \u201cIt\u2019s as close as it gets.\u201d  By late morning, emergency crews had largely subdued flames, and the fire moved off in other directions. The blaze prompted public schools and at least five college campuses in the area to cancel classes for the day. Health authorities were handing out disposable air filter masks to members of the public at five cites around the county. On nearby ranches, residents in the protective face masks scrambled to coax nervous horses and other livestock into trailers to drive them to safety. \u201cAs long as we get up, get out of here, get the car moving, everything else can be replaced in theory so you know breathing at the end of the day is better than not breathing at the end of the day,\u201d resident David Pollack told Reuters. The Santa Ana winds are a regional weather phenomenon that sends gusts westward off the desert to the east, through mountain passes toward the coast. They were forecast to reach sustained speeds of 50 to 70 mph (80 to 110 kph) on Wednesday and Thursday. Investigators say the Getty fire was likely caused by a broken tree branch blown into power lines during high winds on Monday morning. It spread, consuming 745 acres (300 hectares) by Wednesday morning, with about a quarter contained by firefighters. At least 12 homes have been destroyed. In northern California, firefighters struggled for a sixth day against the 76,000-acre (30,760-hectare) Kincade fire in Sonoma County\u2019s wine country. That blaze has destroyed at least 189 homes and other structures but was listed as 30 percent contained on Wednesday. PG&E acknowledged last week that the Kincade fire started near a damaged transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line on that tower malfunctioned. The company filed for bankruptcy in January, citing $30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018. As many as 190,000 people were displaced at the height of the Kincade fire, but some evacuations have since been lifted.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6151}

{"claim_id":"11151","hypothesis":"PCSK9-Inhibitor Drug Class That Grew Out of UT Southwestern Research Becomes a Game-Changer for Patient with Extremely High Cholesterol","explanation_1":"Frank Brown, the subject of this news release, with Dr. Khera, his cardiologist.This news release describes one patient\u2019s response to a \u201cgame-changing\u201d new drug designed to help patients manage their cholesterol, and offers a brief history of how this class of drug was developed and how they work. The release offers only anecdotal data on the drug\u2019s efficacy \u2014 it offers numbers for only one patient. What\u2019s more, the release doesn\u2019t even tell readers which drug the patient took (though it narrows it down to one of two drugs). It also tells readers nothing about costs or potential harms, and describes high cholesterol as a disease \u2014 instead of as a risk factor for disease. High levels of cholesterol, especially high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol relative to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are widely considered a significant risk factor for heart disease. However, it is only a risk factor \u2014 it is not a disease in itself. It is important for news releases to characterize this distinction clearly, particularly when the focus of the release is a drug treatment that costs thousands of dollars and carries health risks of its own. That said, the larger question here is why a health research institution issued a news release that offers only anecdotal data on the health of a single patient taking an unspecified drug.","premise":"The release does not address cost at all. While the release does not tell us which of the two new drugs the patient took, it does tell us that he took either evolocumab (sold under the trade name Repatha) or alirocumab (sold under the trade name Praluent). Both drugs are given via injection either once or twice a month. According to press materials issued when Repatha was approved by the FDA in August 2015, \u201cThe U.S. Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) price of Repatha is $542.31 for one 140 mg single-use prefilled SureClick autoinjector or prefilled syringe, or $14,100 annually for the every two weeks administration.\u201d That\u2019s not chump change. According to press materials issued when the FDA approved Praluent last July, \u201cThe U.S. WAC price of Praluent is $40 per day ($1,120 every 28 days) for both the 75 mg and 150 mg doses.\u201d Again, that\u2019s not an insignificant expense. The cost to consumers may vary, depending on each patient\u2019s insurance, etc., but failure to address cost is a significant oversight. This falls short in two different ways. First, the release only tells readers how much one patient\u2019s LDL cholesterol dropped (from 384 to 111). That\u2019s anecdotal data. And, because the release doesn\u2019t tell readers which drug the patient was taking, it is not even clear which drug was responsible for that single patient\u2019s lower cholesterol numbers. Second, the release doesn\u2019t tell readers what this reduction in LDL cholesterol means in terms of the patient\u2019s actual health. Does it reduce the patient\u2019s risk of a heart attack? If so, by how much \u2014 a lot? A little? The release does not mention potential harms at all. If anything, it does just the opposite, saying at one point that an observation of a woman with a genetic variation that naturally confers the effects of this class of drugs suggests that \u201ctherapies aimed at blocking [the protein targeted by these drugs] would not only be effective, but also safe.\u201d That\u2019s a good anecdote about the inspiration for the drug treatment, but it\u2019s problematic in a release that seems to focus almost exclusively on anecdotes. Particularly since the release does not tell readers that both evolocumab and alirocumab have potential adverse side effects. According to the press materials for evolocumab (Repatha), \u201cIn a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha-treated patients.\u201d And the press materials for alirocumab (Praluent) note \u201cPraluent can cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions that can be severe and require treatment in a hospital.\u201d What\u2019s more,\u00a0there could be less common, but more serious adverse effects that will only come to light after large numbers of patients take these drugs for long time. There is nothing in the release that says for how long the drug was used. These potential health effects are worth noting \u2014 especially in a release that focuses solely on the use of a new class of drugs. The release shares incomplete information on one patient\u2019s experience. That is not satisfactory. This is a close call but we think it crosses the line to Not Satisfactory. We stated this above, but it bears repeating: High levels of cholesterol, especially high levels of LDL cholesterol relative to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are widely considered a significant risk factor for heart disease. However, it is only a risk factor \u2014 it is not a disease in itself. The release refers to \u201cdangerously high levels of cholesterol\u201d in its opening paragraph, and it focuses on the story of a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia \u2014 a condition that is known to cause premature heart disease. But it never tells readers that cholesterol is only a risk factor and doesn\u2019t give any insight into how common this condition is or how worried the average reader should be about it. \u201cThere are many more Frank Browns out there \u2013 patients who can\u2019t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs,\u201d the release says. How many? The release doesn\u2019t talk about funding for this individual patient, which is fine. But it does talk about a number of researchers who were involved in developing evolocumab and alirocumab. Were those researchers supported by the relevant drug companies? Does the medical school itself have partnerships with these companies? It\u2019s not clear. If those potential conflicts do not exist, it would have been good to make that clear \u2014 particularly in a case like this, where the rationale for the news release is not clear to readers. The release does mention three other drugs that are designed to reduce cholesterol levels. However, the release would have been stronger if it had also mentioned the importance of diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors that can significantly influence cholesterol levels. The release notes that the drugs have been approved by the FDA, and that at least one of them was available to the patient described in the release. The reader can infer that the drugs are available to the public. The release explains what is novel about this particular class of drugs. However, it\u2019s not at all clear why this release is coming out now. The drugs themselves were approved by the FDA last summer and the release does not appear to be related to the publication of research findings. There is virtually no information here that was not available six months ago, other than the anecdotal data on one patient. We would like to give the release a pass here, because we already dinged the release for the way it discusses cholesterol under \u201cDisease Mongering.\u201d However, we can\u2019t. Here\u2019s why: the release refers to this drug class as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in its headline. What does that mean? Even accepting the fact that the headline says the drug was a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for only one patient, it\u2019s still pretty fuzzy. Did the drug lower the patient\u2019s LDL cholesterol to optimal levels? No, and the release itself says as much. Did the drug significantly reduce the patient\u2019s risk for future heart problems? It\u2019s not clear, because the release doesn\u2019t address that. If a release is going to use hyperbolic language \u2014 whether it\u2019s a \u201cgame-changer\u201d or a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d or a \u201choly grail\u201d \u2014 it needs to clearly lay out the results to back it up. That is not the case here.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":430}
{"claim_id":"10085","hypothesis":"Close Look at Orthotics Raises a Welter of Doubts","explanation_1":"The question posed in the article is basically the following:\u00a0 \u201cAre shoe inserts (foot orthotics) effective in the prevention and treatment of injuries among athletes?\u201d\u2019  Why is this impossibly broad? This question encompasses dozens of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and degenerative conditions involving scores of scientific studies. It would have been better for the article to define its scope more narrowly\u2014e.g., foot injuries, lower limb injuries, or low back pain\u2014 and look at the evidence more carefully. Gazing through the prism of a single scientist\u2019s work, the article presents an interesting narrative about the difficulties of performing biomechanical and clinical research in this area. And it endorses a skeptical attitude in interpreting the claims of proponents in this multi-billion dollar industry. However, the answer to the main question is fundamentally unsatisfying\u2014and \u201csoft\u201d from an evidence perspective: \u201cShoe inserts may be helpful as a short-term solution, preventing injuries in some athletes,\u201d according to the New York Times. This is a soft statement because almost any prevention method or treatment will help somebody over the short-term some of the time. And this permissive conclusion will certainly not deter athletes from seeking out orthotics for dozens of conditions on the premise that they might work. However, this broad-brush conclusion doesn\u2019t adequately characterize the evidence regarding shoe inserts. That evidence cleaves a little more neatly than this article implies. By conventional medical standards (well-designed clinical trials) there is no conclusive evidence that shoe inserts are effective in the prevention and treatment of the majority of athletic injuries. There are a few conditions for which there is preliminary evidence that shoe inserts may offer modest preventive or therapeutic benefits. But importantly, and never mentioned in this article, there are also conditions in which the effectiveness of shoe inserts has been tested and disproven. There is credible evidence, for example, that shoe inserts do not prevent low back pain. If scientists are going to go to the trouble of performing demanding research, it is important that journalists report those results. (See Sahar et al., 2009). Reference: Sahar T et al., Insoles for prevention and treatment of low back pain: a systematic review within the framework of the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group, Spine, 2009; 34(9): 924-933. The role of shoe inserts in the prevention and treatment of athletic injuries remains one of the most controversial topics in sports medicine, orthopedics and podiatry. Musculoskeletal pain is a universal complaint in the general population and prompts tens of millions of physician visits every year. The idea of relieving and preventing pain and dysfunction with a simple insole or insert is beguiling. The aging of the general population\u2014and the rising tide of weight gain and obesity\u2014are colliding to create a growth industry for orthotics. Shoe inserts\u2014including inexpensive off-the-shelf products and costly custom-made orthotics\u2014 are widely prescribed and used in the prevention and treatment of foot problems, knee and hip pain, shin splints, low back pain and many other musculoskeletal conditions. Yet after several decades of research the benefit of shoe inserts for most injuries and conditions remains uncertain. And it is not clear if the billions of dollars spent on shoe inserts translates into the wholesale alleviation of pain and dysfunction\u2014or just the wholesale transfer of dollars.","premise":"It would have been useful to discuss the relative costs of off-the-shelf and custom shoe inserts. The former are generally less than $50 while the latter can run into many hundreds of dollars. The article mentions the expensive price-tag of custom-made orthotics. It didn\u2019t, however, discuss the overall costs of off-the-shelf shoe inserts, which have to be replaced with regularity. The article offered a brief characterization of the magnitude of benefits related to orthotics among soldiers in one study. But in general the article did not adequately frame the potential benefits of shoe inserts. For instance, in the review that reported a benefit for orthotics in the prevention and treatment of plantar fasciitis and tibial stress fractures, how impressive was that benefit? This article focused largely on the potential upside of shoe inserts\u2014and didn\u2019t explicitly address potential harms from the use of orthotics. It mentioned that inserts could increase muscle work requirements but didn\u2019t discuss the significance of this point in terms of pain and function. Some of the potential harms\u2014 such as exacerbating injury risk and\/or pain and dysfunction\u2014are obvious. There are more subtle harms as well, such as creating the expectation among athletes that they cannot safely exercise, perform normal daily activities, and work\u00a0 without the aid of an orthotic. It would be difficult if not impossible for a journalist to evaluate the evidence on such a broad topic. And the article didn\u2019t adequately characterize the evidence regarding shoe inserts in the prevention or treatment of most common athletic injuries. It cited a single published review on orthotics and injury prevention for lower leg injuries, but didn\u2019t discuss other reviews of the evidence. There was no suggestion of disease mongering. In fact, the article rebutted the need for orthotics in the correction of mechanical\/alignment problems and in the management of asymptomatic abnormalities such as flat feet. The article did present the views of several independent sources. However, the article did not address or identify potential financial conflicts among the contributors beyond identifying their organizations or institutions. Both biomechanical research and footwear research rely heavily on industry funding, which may skew the views of researchers. So this is an important issue. And we can\u2019t give a satisfactory score for half a loaf. The article did not discuss alternatives to orthotics for athletes. Yet there are many other preventive and therapeutic strategies such as flexibility and strength training, proprioceptive work, and attention to technique which may offer superior benefits to simple insoles and inserts. The article focused mainly on orthotics compared to no intervention. This might be appropriate for prevention, but a symptomatic patient would also be considering other physical treatments and interventions. Both off-the-shelf and custom shoe inserts are widely available. This doesn\u2019t merit discussion. The shoe inserts described in this study are widely available and are not particularly novel in concept or design. The article did not \u201chype\u201d particular orthotics because of innovative characteristics or qualities. The article did not appear to rely on a press release.","label":2,"__index_level_0__":6944}

The show's writers didn't so much \"\"predict\"\" such campaigns, as satirize previous ones, which happened to be replicated in the years since the episode aired.\"","premise":"Several times in recent years, various websites and online \u201clisticles\u201d have claimed that, among other uncanny predictions, the Simpsons once pre-empted the real-life censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d statue. In particular, in 2017 the comedian and former NFL punter Pat McAfee devoted a five-minute segment on his podcast to reviewing and promoting various claimed instances where the classic animated sitcom was remarkably prescient about events that were yet to happen. He said: \u201cThe censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s David: 1990 [it occurred on the show], 2016 it happened.\u201d Likewise, in a 2018 article listing more than 30 occasions when \u201creal life has imitated \u2018The Simpsons,'\u201d the Daily Telegraph wrote: Itchy and Scratchy also featured heavily in the 1990 episode Itchy and Scratchy and Marge, in which Marge led a censorship campaign, horrified by the show\u2019s violence. She later realised the censorship had gone too far, after Michelangelo\u2019s David was taken to a Springfield museum, and local citizens protested against the statue\u2019s nudity. In 2001, a Florida-based shop put a replica of Michelangelo\u2019s David outside its front door. A handful of citizens objected to the \u201cindecent\u201d statue and successfully campaigned to have David\u2019s private parts covered with a cloth. More recently, in 2014, an elderly British couple, Clive and Joan Burgess, received complaints from neighbours and faced an intervention from their local council, after they placed a replica of the statue in their front garden. In May 2019, Business Insider published a list of \u201c18 Times \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Accurately Predicted the Future,\u201d including the bowdlerization of \u201cDavid\u201d: \u201cAn episode from 1990 titled \u2018Itchy and Scratchy and Marge\u2019 showed Springfieldians protesting against Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David being exhibited in the local museum, calling the artwork obscene for its nudity. The satire of censorship came true in July 2016, when Russian campaigners voted on whether to clothe a copy of the Renaissance statue that had been set up in central St. Petersburg.\u201d The basic facts, dates, and descriptions of events laid out in these articles and in McAfee\u2019s podcast were accurate. The episode in question was Season 2, Episode 9, \u201cItchy and Scratchy and Marge,\u201d and it did indeed first air on Dec. 20, 1990. In the episode, Marge rails against the ultra-violence and obscenity of the \u201cItchy and Scratchy Show,\u201d and leads a campaign of censorship against the cartoon. The writers brilliantly examine and expose the relativity and subjectivity of taste, obscenity, and moral standards in culture, and Marge\u2019s crusade spirals out of control, culminating in a local group picketing Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d for its nudity. It\u2019s also true that, as McAfee alluded to, a campaign took place in the Russian city of St. Petersburg in 2016 that aimed to remove a replica of the statue, or cover up the male figure\u2019s genitals \u2014 not a far cry from the kind of campaign depicted in the 1990 \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode. However, the difficulty in claiming that Matt Groening and his writers \u201cpredicted\u201d the censorship of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d lies in the fact that campaigns to cover up nude works of art in general, and \u201cDavid\u201d in particular, have existed for centuries. The prevalence of fig leafs on classical statues is testament to that, as Alexxa Gotthardt wrote for the website Artsy in 2018: Take Michelangelo\u2019s famous sculpture \u201cDavid\u201d (1501\u201304), a muscular, starkly naked depiction of its namesake biblical hero. The work scandalized the artist\u2019s fellow Florentines and the Catholic clergy when unveiled in Florence\u2019s Piazza della Signoria in 1504. Soon after, the figure\u2019s sculpted phallus was girdled with a garland of bronze fig leaves by authorities.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":6206}
{"claim_id":"9506","hypothesis":"Tweaking brains with \u2018smart drugs\u2019 to get ahead in Silicon Valley","explanation_1":"This story about purported brain-boosting pills would have been easier to swallow if it came with a stronger shot of skepticism. The story would have benefited greatly from at least one source who isn\u2019t involved in the cognitive-enhancement movement. It does a better job of describing the availability of these supplements and the hyper-competitive culture that feeds this emerging market. The term \u201cnootropics\u201d applies to a wide variety of substances that apparently require no safety or efficacy trials, no FDA approval, and no prescription from a doctor. As a result, media coverage is often consumers\u2019 only tool to counter the marketing hype when attempting to determine whether these products will do them good or harm, or simply waste their money. Sadly critical coverage is in short supply. Back in 2015, HealthNewsReview.org Associate Editor Kathlyn Stone wrote that nootropics were \u201cunder the radar\u201d of journalists, despite heavy marketing targeted at students and young professionals. That appears to be changing, but journalists need to be cognizant of their role as consumer watchdogs.","premise":"There\u2019s no discussion of cost. We found one drug cited in this story \u2014 piracetam \u2014 online for $39.99 for 180 capsules. For those seeking a cocktail of supposed brain boosters, startup Nootrobox charges $135 for \u201call the nootropics you need to enhance your cognitive state for one month.\u201d The company explains: \u201cCognitive performance is an active, long-term investment.\u201d (Notably, piracetam isn\u2019t on Nootrobox\u2019s ingredient list. For more on that, read the section on availability.) The story doesn\u2019t quantify any known benefits of these brain enhancers, for example if memory increased by a certain percent. Harms are addressed\u2013enough to be Satisfactory for this criteria. But the discussion is confusing. The story initially says nootropics have \u201csupposedly few side effects and low toxicity.\u201d Later it states: As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d In contrast, consider these unequivocal cautions in a similar Mercury News story last fall, starting in the seventh paragraph: Research into the cognitive benefits of nootropics is still in its early stages, and some experts worry about the long-term health effects of ingesting potent synthetic smart drugs, which are largely unregulated. Some users have reported side effects including headaches, upset stomach, insomnia, anxiety and depression. Dr. Reid Blackwelder, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said it concerns him that customers are ordering such drugs online without consulting a doctor, because some of the substances seem to have a powerful impact on the brain. And much of the research on the cognitive benefits of these substances is supported only by studies using animals, Blackwelder said. This story falls into the trap of relying on positive anecdotes as evidence, citing an entrepreneur who \u201ccredits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees,\u201d as well as a physician who said he with experimented with piracetam and found it \u201chelpful.\u201d Also troublesome is this statement: \u201cPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities.\u201d\u00a0 Saying it\u2019s \u201cwell studied\u201d in the same sentence as giving purported benefits is confusing and may lead readers to assume incorrectly that these benefits were proven in studies. Lastly, the story quotes advocates of fasting without cautioning that what works in mice may not apply to humans. Comments Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging: \u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases.\u201d In fact, there is no such thing as \u201cconclusive evidence from animal studies.\u201d To its credit, the story does eventually\u2013but very briefly\u2013explore the quality of the evidence, mainly via\u00a0this comment from Duke University Health System researcher Murali Doraiswamy: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence.\u201d There\u2019s no outright disease-mongering here, but the preposterous quote that it is \u201cthe few who are getting ahead who are using supplements\u201d should have been challenged. That makes it sounds like \u201cnormal\u201d people are in some way deficient. The story lacks comment from an independent expert who\u2019s not involved with selling, prescribing or taking nootropics or some other cognition-boosting product. The story doesn\u2019t address proven strategies to improve mental skills such as good nutrition, adequate sleep, social engagement, cognitively challenging activities, and exercise. The story does a good job here, although it injects confusion when it states that in the U.S. piracetam \u201ccan be sold only for research purposes,\u201d but later says that piracetam and similar drugs are available online. In fact, the FDA at least twice warned suppliers, in 2010 and 2012, that piracetam was classified as a drug and could not be sold as a supplement. According to online accounts, that FDA action prompted major retailers to stop carrying it, which could explain why it\u2019s not present in some products marketed as nootropics. The story also states: \u201cA number of companies now market nootropic \u2018stacks,\u2019 or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\u201d There story gives perspective, mentioning that piracetam has been around for decades, though newer formulations are on the market, and that companies have recently begun marketing \u201cstacks\u201d with multiple supplements. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":5579}
{"claim_id":"9595","hypothesis":"Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers","explanation_1":"Reducing sugar\u2014but not calories\u2014in the diets of a small group of children who have obesity led to substantial reductions in heart disease risk factors in only nine days, a new study shows. This brief New York Times Well blog post does a good\u00a0job explaining these details, including the cautionary information that the study was small and of short duration. But the cost of brevity is\u00a0that it fails\u00a0to offer readers the kinds of methodological and explanatory details that would have helped them judge the relatively cursory nature of the research. Instead, it encourages readers to view the study as part of a growing body of research by referring them to a longer and more detailed 2015 post about a study conducted by some of the same scientists. Alas, a quick look at the methodological details suggests that both studies stem from the same group of child participants. It is not unusual for a single study to generate several research articles. But one could make the argument here that holding such small studies in abeyance and waiting for the bigger picture would serve readers better. Including commentary from an independent expert also would have strengthened the post. Although we Americans cling desperately to our sugary foods, learning that reducing sugar could markedly improve our health might encourage significant behavior change in this country. There is a growing\u2013but certainly not\u00a0conclusive\u2013body of evidence that suggests there might be unique concerns with sugar beyond just its calories, such as being a possible contributor to heart disease.","premise":"The brief text reflects only on removing highly sugared foods\u00a0in the diet of children. Replacement foods used in the study were commonly available at no obvious extra cost. This short narrative does an admirable job of getting specific about physiological changes that took place in these children over the course\u00a0of nine days. However, the story should have\u00a0established what this means in terms of an outcome that someone cares about. What would be the expected reduction in risk of heart attack or stroke? How big are the changes clinically, and how do they compare with other approaches? It\u2019s probably hard to say since these are children, but then the story should acknowledge that. The study sought to hold number of calories constant in order to examine the impact of reduced sugar. While many health experts would point out that substituting pizza and bagels does not meet the criteria for an overall healthy diet, that was not a concern of this design. This was a modest study, with only 37 or 43 (the blog post indicates 37 while a UCSF\u00a0news\u00a0release indicates 43) child participants who were tracked over nine days. The reporter does label the effort \u201csmall and short-term.\u201d Calls to reduce sugar in our diets have burgeoned in recent years, and data do seem to suggest that eating less sugar is beneficial. Just how beneficial is still a matter of study. There are no independent sources\u2013the one person quoted\u00a0is study coauthor, Dr. Robert Lustig, who has a potential conflict of interest. Lustig wrote a book that\u2019s extremely critical of sugar, and has spoken of fructose as \u201cpoison.\u201d The story makes no mention of other strategies typically employed to reduce markers of heart disease, including other types of dietary changes, exercise and drugs such as statins (which are typically reserved for adults). The UCSF\u00a0news\u00a0release did include this type of information. Bagels and pizza are ubiquitous. The extent to which the research is novel is left unexplored. The blog post does reference a 2015 post about a research report that, while examining different physiological end points, reaches similar conclusions about sugar as a bad actor. The UCSF news\u00a0release provided a lot of information about this study, but the blog post\u00a0sticks with\u00a0a short summary of the\u00a0findings.

{"claim_id":"9525","hypothesis":"Cuddling Preemies Kangaroo Style Helps Into Adulthood","explanation_1":"This story reports on a 20-year follow-up study of low birth weight infants in Colombia who received continuous skin-to-skin contact with a caregiver as part of a practice known as kangaroo mother care (KMC). Researchers concluded that infants who had been randomized to receive KMC rather than staying in an incubator reaped long-lasting social and behavioral benefits such as lower mortality, lower school absenteeism and fewer behavior problems. This coverage describes both positive and negative findings of the 20-year outcomes,\u00a0which were reported in the journal Pediatrics, but it doesn\u2019t include quantified data or tap independent sources. It also misses important limitations, such as the difficulty of measuring the precise impact of a multi-faceted intervention after 20 years have gone by. It seems odd to label as an \u201cintervention\u201d something as natural as skin-to-skin contact between a mother and a baby, along with an emphasis on breastfeeding and early hospital discharge. KMC was developed in the 1970s in Bogat\u00e1, Colombia, partly in response to overtaxed neonatal care facilities. But its many demonstrated benefits \u2014 including lower mortality and infection rates, greater breastfeeding and stronger family bonding \u2014 have pushed those concepts into mainstream preemie care in countries of all income levels. The World Health Organization includes KMC in its guidelines to improve premature birth outcomes. Some 15 million babies are born too early every year, leading to nearly 1 million deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organization. Survivors are prone to learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. The vast majority of these at-risk infants are in developing countries where medical resources are limited. Despite some flaws, this study offers reassurance that premature babies who spend their early days with skin-to-skin will fare at least as well as adults as those who were in an incubator. Stories should not extrapolate beyond that.","premise":"The costs of this intervention or of the control, a neonatal minimal care unit in which infants remain in an incubator while they gain weight, aren\u2019t mentioned. The story states that KMC babies were 39 percent more likely to live into adulthood, but doesn\u2019t give absolute numbers to help readers judge the significance of this finding. The story also lists several other benefits without quantifying them (or even explaining what they mean in some cases), including that the babies \u201cgrew up with fewer social problems,\u201d stayed in school longer and earned more as adults. It quotes a researcher saying they \u201chad less aggressive drive and were less impulsive and hyperactive\u201d compared to babies who stayed in an incubator.\u201d There aren\u2019t any obvious harms from this intervention, although the story does note the finding that children given standard incubator care had higher math and language scores in school even though IQ levels were similar in both groups. A 2012 Cochrane review of multiple studies found no negative outcomes associated with skin-to-skin contact for healthy newborns except for one study\u2019s report of longer duration of breastfeeding in a control group. The story acknowledges KMC \u201cdidn\u2019t work miracles. Children with cerebral palsy were equally likely to have symptoms whether they had the kangaroo care or not, and more than half the people in the entire group needed glasses.\u201d But, the story should have made the point that it\u2019s difficult to connect the dots between a single intervention and outcomes 20 years down the road. In an editorial accompanying the study, Lydia Furman, MD, of University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, describes several complications with the findings. For one, she notes, KMC is a \u201cbundled intervention\u201d involving parental nurturing, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin contact, making it difficult to discern which contributed to the outcomes. She writes: Second, it is difficult to quantify and qualify parent-associated and parent-delivered interventions because all parents are different. Third, we are a full 20 years out, and \u201clife has happened,\u201d so numerous potentially unmeasured contributions to each individual child\u2019s life (and outcomes) have occurred. Furman notes that the study shows that KMC infants had some superior outcomes. \u201cYet the authors are pressed to explain the significantly higher math and language academic scores in the traditional care group. In other words, it is complicated.\u201d The story accurately states that 20 million babies are born at a low birth weight every year, according to the World Health Organization. We did take issue with this speculative quote about the behavior of the babies in the skin-to-skin group, which was featured prominently in all caps in the NBC story: \u201cTHEY EXHIBITED LESS ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR, WHICH MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH SEPARATION FROM THE MOTHER AT BIRTH.\u201d This borders on fear-mongering. For all mothers\u2013but especially moms who have premature babies and\/or complicated births\u2013having a newborn is very stressful. The looming threat that antisocial behavior is a risk the mother is specifically responsible for in these fragile days and hours may compound the\u00a0stress. The story lacked comment from independent sources. While there are some statements about KMC attributed to the World Health Organization, those statements don\u2019t address the findings of this study. An independent source likely could have provided some context and important reassurances to parents who had premature babies but either weren\u2019t offered kangaroo care or weren\u2019t able to because of birth complications, which is a growing problem in the U.S. The purpose of the study was to compare the KMC approach with a neonatal intensive care. There are no other viable alternatives to infant care that we know of. The story notes that KMC requires parents to receive adequate support and follow-up. But we would have liked to see more information, such as how widely this approach is used to treat premature infants and what some of the barriers might be in high-income countries where incubator care has been the norm. For example, how many U.S. neonatal intensive care units incorporate skin-to-skin contact in their care? Which babies in intensive care don\u2019t or can\u2019t get this kind of care? From what we could find, what makes this study notable is that it\u2019s the only 20-year follow-up for this kind of intervention. In an indirect way, the story touches upon this. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.","label":3,"__index_level_0__":9353}

The ratio of bleach in the Facebook post was 77 times higher than the dilution Clorox advised.Bleach, Food Science, and Pet SafetyA PDF published by food scientists at the University of Oklahoma issued guidelines regarding the safe use of \u201cchlorine bleach for sanitizing raw fruits and vegetables,\u201d\u00a0writing:Presumably, the fresh water rinse eliminates any potential problem with residual chlorine. As a practical matter, residual chlorine would in most foods produce highly objectionable flavors and odors well before becoming a safety hazard. Food processing in-plant chlorination systems typically produce water for processing with residual available chlorine levels of no more than 0.5 ppm. For container cooling or general washing, residual available chlorine levels of 2 to 7 ppm are commonly used. Typical municipal water systems produce potable water with a residual available chlorine level of 0.25 to 2 ppm.Per the guidance, \u201cresidual\u201d bleach would \u2014 for humans \u2014 produce an unpleasant flavor or scent before reaching levels of poisoning risk; diluted bleach is used in food processing at low levels. That said, a number of veterinary advice pages address accidental bleach ingestion in pets and suggest that animals do not always avoid eating objects contaminated with it.A 2008 toxicology brief about bleach and dogs notes that calculating a precise safe level of diluted bleach is difficult, but extrapolates a rough amount from known levels of human toxicity. That report involved two dogs which were euthanized after consuming undiluted bleach:While a lethal dose of sodium hypochlorite in dogs is not established in the veterinary literature, extrapolation from a reported lethal dose of sodium chloride of 3.7 g\/kg in dogs may be considered. For example, a 40-lb (18-kg) dog would have to ingest about 67 g of sodium chloride to attain this lethal dose. The consumption of 1 L of 6.15% sodium hypochlorite bleach containing 19.1 mg\/ml of sodium and 30 mg\/ml of chloride would equal the ingestion of 49.1 g of sodium chloride. Assuming the animals only ingested several hundred milliliters of bleach, this amount would not have been sufficient to attain the lethal dose of sodium chloride. However, corrosive injury to the gastrointestinal tract and the development of other metabolic derangements and secondary complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, likely contributed to the severity of the toxicosis. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that ingestion of at least several hundred milliliters of bleach resulted in the severe morbidity of these dogs, which led to their euthanasia.Researchers deduced a lethal dose of 67 grams for a dog weighing roughly 40 lbs. ; one teaspoon is equivalent to about 4.2 grams, and a tablespoon contains about 14.6 grams. Although most of the concentrations mentioned above diluted the nearly 15 grams of a tablespoon in either a quart or a gallon, the Facebook post advised one part of bleach to ten parts of water.Clorox also featured a March 2018 page about pet-safe uses of Clorox bleach, and noting that bleach can serve as \u201ca simple and inexpensive way to help prevent the spread of parvo and other viruses.\u201d That recommended a slightly stronger dilution for disinfecting toys and crates:Use Clorox\u00ae Regular-Bleach to disinfect hard, nonporous surfaces and accessories like crates and toys on a regular basis. You can use a solution of \u00bd cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water. To kill parvo, soak the items in the solution for 10 minutes, then rinse and air dry.That solution of half a cup of bleach to a gallon of water was stronger than the pumpkin solution Clorox recommended (a teaspoon per gallon), as there were 32 half cups in a gallon. Therefore, the recommended ratio for pet cleaning was one part bleach to 32 parts of water.SummaryA viral Facebook post was correct in indicating that a \u201cbleach bath\u201d could preserve pumpkins, but its ratio of one part of bleach to ten parts water was far stronger than the ratio recommended by Clorox, on a page designed to sell more bleach. Although other sites (like BobVila.com and ApartmentTherapy.com) recommended bleach baths for all pumpkins, Clorox only advised bleach for carved pumpkins and compared their treatment to that of cut flowers. Clorox said that carved pumpkins could be preserved with a solution of a teaspoon of bleach per gallon, or one teaspoon of bleach to 768 teaspoons of water.Comments","label":3,"__index_level_0__":2646}
{"claim_id":"13305","hypothesis":"Sen. (Richard) Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.","explanation_1":"\"Ross\u2019 ad said Burr \"\"voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.\"\" Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the law\u2019s reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, the\u00a0ad ignores that\u00a0three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law.\"","premise":"\"In a recent campaign ad, North Carolina Democrat Deborah Ross blasted her opponent, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, for voting against the landmark Violence Against Women Act. \"\"Sen. Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act,\"\" a narrator says in the ad, while the text, \"\"Richard Burr: Opposed Violence Against Women Act,\"\" appears on the screen, along with a citation for a bill considered in the Senate in 2012. Here\u2019s a screenshot from the ad:  Is Ross\u2019 ad correct? In part, but it it leaves out important context. What was Burr voting for? First, we should note that the ad used some loose language about what Burr was actually voting on. The 2012 vote referenced in the ad was for a reauthorization bill -- that is, an updating of the existing Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed in 2011. Burr was not in Congress when the act itself was initially passed in 1994; he was sworn in for his first term in the U.S. House the following year, in 1995. The 2000 and 2005 votes Congress voted to reauthorize the act in both 2000 and 2005, and both legislative efforts were fairly uncontroversial. For the 2000 effort, Burr was in the House, and he voted in favor of the reauthorization, which was passed by the overwhelming margin of 415-3. While that version didn\u2019t become law, another version did become law during that Congress; it passed the House by voice vote. Individual House members\u2019 votes aren\u2019t recorded in a voice vote, but they are usually only held for non-controversial measures. By the time the 2005 reauthorization effort rolled around, Burr had been elected to the Senate. The reauthorization bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, a process by which senators are given a chance to object to a bill and, if there no objections are made, the bill is deemed passed. So Burr would not have opposed the 2005 reauthorization. The 2012 vote The 2012 reauthorization effort was far more controversial than the previous two, since it involved changes that some social conservatives found objectionable. At the time, the Democrats controlled the presidency and the Senate, while the Republicans controlled the House. The Senate bill would \"\"allow Indian tribal courts to try certain non-Indians in some cases of domestic violence on reservations, expand the number of temporary visas for illegal immigrants who were victims of domestic violence and extend the protections of that act to gay men and lesbians,\"\" the New York Times reported at the time. These provisions were anathema to many conservatives, and when faced with a vote on April 26, 2012, Burr was one of 31 Republicans to vote against it, while 15 Republicans voted for it. Overall, the measure passed the chamber by a 60-31 margin. Instead, Burr voted for a failed Republican-sponsored amendment that would have stripped out some of the elements of the bill that were controversial to Republicans. We were unable to find a contemporaneous explanation by Burr on the reason for his vote through Google or Nexis. The only comment he made on the bill to a media outlet came was procedural rather than substantive, when he said that he thought there were more urgent bills for the chamber to prioritize than the reauthorization. Ultimately, the Republican-led House passed a version that omitted the provisions of the Senate bill that conservatives opposed. The House and Senate were unable to come to an agreement, and the measure was dead for the duration of that Congress. It\u2019s worth noting that Politico reported on March 14, 2012, that the Democratic effort to push a vote on the Violence Against Women Act in the spring of 2012 was to make it a \"\"political weapon.\"\" \"\"Republicans have several objections to the legislation, but instead of making changes, Schumer wants to fast-track the bill to the floor, let the GOP block it, then allow Democrats to accuse Republicans of waging a \u2018war against women,\u2019 \"\" the Politico story said. \"\"It\u2019s fodder for a campaign ad, and it\u2019s not the only potential 30-second spot ready to spring from Senate leadership these days.\"\" With this ad, that mission was accomplished. The 2013 vote After the failure to get the two chambers to agree on a single version in 2012, the new Congress took up the effort again in 2013. Partisan control of each part of government remained the same in 2013, and the reauthorization effort played out in a similar fashion. Republicans pursued an amendment to strip out some of the elements they found problematic, such as the provisions related to native Americans and gender identity. On Feb. 7, 2013, the amendment failed by a 34-65 margin, with Burr voting in favor of it. Then, on Feb. 12, 2013, the Senate passed the original measure, 78-22. Burr was among a handful of Republican senators who switched their position and supported the bill. In fact, Burr has subsequently trumpeted elements of this bill. Burr joined with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to introduce the\u00a0Child Protection Compact Act, which was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. This provision \"\"seeks to protect and rescue children from trafficking by creating \u2018Child Protection Compacts\u2019 between the United States and countries with significant numbers of children in human trafficking,\"\" Burr\u2019s Senate website says. On the other hand, the Ross camp argues, the refusal of Republicans to approve the original bill resulted in a year-long delay in the reauthorization, which kept sexual violence awareness and assistance programs on college campuses from being established, even though reports of sexual assault on college campuses were at an all-time high. So where does this leave us? The Ross camp argues that the ad is accurate since it said that Burr voted against the 2012 version of the bill. They have a point, but making this argument requires ignoring that Burr voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act three times -- in 2000, 2005 and 2013 -- even as he voted against it once, in 2012. The Ross camp also argues that the 2012 vote is important because Burr opposed -- and even voted to strip -- provisions involving LGBT and native Americans. They also have a point here, but their argument would have been stronger had the ad specifically cited Burr\u2019s actions toward LGBT and native Americans. The ad makes no such distinctions; a viewer would be left to assume that he opposed anything to combat violence against women. Finally, we think it\u2019s relevant to note here that, according to Politico, the Democrats specifically teed up this vote to put Republicans in a bind so they could use their votes in campaign ads -- a tactic that both parties have used when they are in a position to do so. Our ruling Ross\u2019 ad said Burr \"\"voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.\"\" Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the law\u2019s reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, the\u00a0ad ignores that\u00a0three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law.\"","label":3,"__index_level_0__":1999}
{"claim_id":"11268","hypothesis":"New \u201cmorning-after\u201d pill effective and safe: FDA staff","explanation_1":"By definition, emergency contraception is meant to be used only when other means of contraception fail. Controversy about emergency contraception typically centers around how it works \u2013 whether it prevents ovulation or blocks implantation of a fertilized egg. If emergency contraception works after fertilization, some would consider it an aborting agent. Regardless of its method of action, however, emergency contraception provides a safe and effective alternative to abortion. Although many women experience uncomfortable side effects from the medication, these are temporary and there are very few risks. In the US, the most commonly used emergency contraceptive is Plan B or levonogestrel. It contains the progestin commonly found in most birth control pills, but in much higher doses. Plan B acts to prevent ovluation. Mifeprex, or RU-486, can be used as an emergency contraceptive or aborting agent depending on when it is used. Last year, the EllaOne was approved for use in Europe and the UK. It has been shown to be effective for up to 5 days after contraceptive failure and has few side effects. Now, the FDA will meet to decide on its approval for use in the US. This story about EllaOne does not mention costs, does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence to support the drug and does not provide quantification of the benefits or harms of the drug. And it doesn\u2019t quote any independent sources outside of the FDA or the pharmaceutical company. Quoting independent sources to provide some perspective on what this might mean to women would have greatly improved this story. The absence of cost info, of comparisons to the most important alternatives (Plan B or Mifeprex), and of any sense of the scope of the benefits or harms were problems with this story. It was not clear that any independent vetting of claims took place.","premise":"\"The story does not mention costs. Although it is hard to say definitively how much the drug would cost in the US since it is not yet available, the story could have mentioned the cost of the drug in Europe or provide an estimate from the drug manufacturer or even from an analyst. The story provides no quanitification of benefits from the drug. Ideally, the story would have described the likelihood of pregnancy after uNPRotected sex with or without the drug. According to British sources \"\"It is estimated that for every 100 women who take Ellaone up to five days after uNPRotected sex, approximately two women will become pregnant. The tablet is more effective at preventing pregnancy the earlier it is taken, so it is important to take it as soon as possible after uNPRotected sex, rather than delay it to the fifth day.\"\" The story mentions that the FDA found no unexpected adverse events and describes the side effects of the drug including nausea, headache and abdominal pain as \"\"common.\"\" The package insert for EllaOne describes these side effects as affecting more than 10% of users. It would have been helpful if the story had cited that stat. The story does not describe the quality of the evidence to support the use of the drug. The story does not engage in disease mongering. The story quotes no independent sources outside of the FDA or the pharmaceutical company. Quoting independent sources to provide some perspective on what this might mean to women, would have greatly improved this story. Although the story mentions other emergency contraceptive options, it does not really describe the pluses and minuses of the new approach compared to the most important alternatives, Plan B or Mifeprex. The story clearly states that the FDA is now reviewing the drug and that it is not yet available in the US but is available in Europe. Clearly the drug is not new since it is already available in Europe. The FDA is now considering its approval for use in the US. Not applicable because we can\u2019t be sure if the story relied solely on a press release.\"","label":3,"__index_level_0__":5974}
{"claim_id":"15434","hypothesis":"We are the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right.","explanation_1":"\"Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Sanders was a bit vague about which countries he was comparing to America, but his office clarified that he was thinking of the group that belongs to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. Mexico also has not achieved universal coverage, but Mexico is also a much poorer country and not always considered an industrialized or advanced economy. As for a guaranteed right to health care, Sanders spoke as though every advanced economy had it. In reality, some do and some don\u2019t. He should have talked about universal coverage, but he didn\u2019t. Sanders\u2019 statement lacked some much needed clarity.\"","premise":"\"The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling on Obamacare subsidies kept the program rolling, and\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders was totally celebrating. Still, the independent from Vermont who is running as a Democrat for president told ABC News host George Stephanopoulos that the nation was far from out of the woods on health care. \"\"We still have 35 million Americans without insurance,\"\" Sanders said on June 28, 2015, during an interview on This Week. \"\"We need to join the rest of the industrialized world. We are the only major country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people as a right.\"\" We wanted to check Sanders\u2019 claim that the United States is \"\"the only major country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people as a right.\"\" This is a common theme for Sanders but the words he used this time muddied his message on two fronts -- which countries and what guarantee? A spokesman for Sanders, Michael Briggs, said Sanders was referring to nations that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We\u2019re not sure Sanders made that entirely clear (for instance the OECD doesn\u2019t include China or Russia, which many people would consider a major country), but we\u2019ll put that aside for the moment. Anyway, Briggs directed us to a 2014 OECD report that found only two member countries, the United States and Mexico, lack universal health care coverage. \"\"However, Mexico passed a law in 2004 with the goal of establishing universal coverage, and they're currently at 90 percent,\"\" Briggs said. \"\"The ACA was never intended to establish universal coverage, and according to the January CBO estimate, 90 percent is about as good as it's going to get.\"\" We checked and Briggs is close on his numbers. In Mexico, as of 2013, public insurance reached about 86.7 percent of the people. That\u2019s actually not much different from where America stood, if you combine public and private coverage. The figure in the United States was 84.9 percent. However, in 2015, the CBO estimated that 89 percent of American residents -- excluding undocumented immigrants -- have coverage. The number drops to 87 percent if you include undocumented residents. The median income in Mexico is so low, about a third that in the United States, that some would not group it with the stronger OECD countries. In fact, Mexico is often referred to as an emerging or developing economy as opposed to an industrialized or developed one. But since Sanders\u2019 spokesman included it, we thought it only fair to include it, too. Beyond the raw numbers, Sanders statement highlights the tricky questions that come up when you start talking about a right to health care. Is it defined as universal coverage, or a legal right to care? The two are not identical. The gold standard Europe covers both bases. Nearly every European nation has signed and ratified the European Social Charter. That treaty\u2019s section on health care casts health care as a right. \"\"The system of health care must be accessible to the entire population. To that end, states should take as their main criterion for judging the success of health system reforms effective access to health care for all, without discrimination, as a basic human right.\"\" Countries follow different paths to make good on that promise. Great Britain has its national health service where the government runs the hospitals and pays the doctors and nurses. Germany and France have a more complicated mix of highly regulated public and private insurance companies, and, as in America, a law that makes insurance mandatory for everyone. Those European nations score 100 when it comes to universal coverage. But so does Australia, and Australia operates under no legal claim that health care is a right. The government\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Department posted on its website \"\"there is no Commonwealth legislation explicitly enshrining the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\"\" That doesn\u2019t stop the Aussies from running an extensive system of public hospitals and a robust public health insurance program. Japan uses a different mix of tools to achieve the same results, and it too lacks a formal legal right to health care. There is a substantial body of Japanese health care law, but it has to do with creating various government programs and setting the rules of the game. A weak guarantee There are several international treaties and conventions that speak of the obligation of countries to provide for the health of their residents. The list includes the World Health Organization constitution and the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The United States signed and ratified the former, but is literally one of a handful of countries that has not ratified the latter. For some, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a landmark document that comes very close to asserting health care as a right. The treaty\u2019s language is ambitious. It speaks of \"\"the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\"\" Countries that get behind it promise that they will \u00a0aim to create the \"\"conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.\"\" But the convention\u2019s legal heft is considerably less than its stated goals. It pushes no country to spend beyond its \"\"available resources,\"\" a quantity that could be whatever the leaders say it is. Lawrence Gostin is the director of Georgetown University\u2019s O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. Gostin said the convention lacks teeth. \"\"These international obligations are vague and unenforceable so really don\u2019t translate into a \u2018right\u2019 in all states,\"\" Gostin said. For Gostin, the test of a nation\u2019s commitment should be measured by the facts on the ground. \"\"Does it provide even reasonably fair access to the entire population, and is there a way to enforce or implement the right,\"\" Gostin said. \"\"By those measures, the U.S. has many entitlements to health care, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and ACA subsidies. Yes there are many left out but that is true in lots of countries, including China that provides a minuscule amount of health dollars to rural residents.\"\" Whether China is an industrialized country of the sort Sanders mentioned is a matter of debate, but China helps illustrate the difference between a right in law and a right in practice. China has ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On top of that, its Constitution commits the state to provide health services and facilities \"\"all for the protection of the people's health.\"\" But the record of the world\u2019s most populous nation is checkered to say the least. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston-based health policy group, wrote about the evolution of health care in China. In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Blumenthal wrote that about 95 percent of the population has access to modest coverage. \"\"The government has decided to provide all Chinese some protection against the cost of illness, not necessarily as a matter of right, but as a matter of fact,\"\" Blumenthal told PolitiFact. Ake Blomqvist, a health care economist at Carleton University in Canada, has a dimmer view of the connection between China\u2019s legal promises and what it delivers. China might have signed that UN convention but that has had limited effect. \"\"In reality the majority of people in China are at risk of not being able to receive even urgently needed health care if they are unlucky enough to require something that is expensive,\"\" Blomqvist said. Our ruling Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Sanders was a bit vague about which countries he was comparing to America, but his office clarified that he was thinking of the group that belongs to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. Mexico also has not achieved universal coverage, but Mexico is also a much poorer country and not always considered an industrialized or advanced economy.
